If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the course that will be discontinued as defined by the National Education Policy?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Academic program prioritization: A school engaged in the process of prioritizing its programs may decide to either increase, decrease, continue, or discontinue the funding for particular programs, leading to these programs being either expanded, downsized, unchanged, or discontinued entirely. For example, in 2013, Western Carolina University announced that after a process of program prioritization it would discontinue several programs including a bachelor’s in German, a minor in women’s studies, as well master’s programs in music, health sciences, English, and mathematics.  Programs are generally prioritized on the basis of their student populations and potential to attract new students. Though, other factors may also weigh in on the likelihood of a program being downsized or discontinued, such as its overall cost for the university.\n\n[2] Ready schools: The concept was popularized in the 1990s by the United States National Education Goals Panel, a taskforce of educators and politicians. The purpose of this taskforce was to set national educational policy in terms of readiness goals for children and schools. This work was discontinued with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act. Ready schools work was continued at the state level, particularly in North Carolina, and through initiatives led by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.\n\n[3] National Education Policy Center: The National Education Policy Center (NEPC) is a non-profit education policy research center located in the School of Education at the University of Colorado at Boulder. It was founded in 2010 and is funded by a variety of governmental organizations, NGOs, and foundations. The Center’s publications are intended for a broad audience that includes academic experts, policy makers, the media, and the general public. The Center's goal is to provide high quality information in support of democratic deliberation about education policy. Among its projects are the Think Tank Review project, the Commercialism in Education Research Unit, and the open access journal \"Education Review\". The Center sponsors research, produces policy briefs, and publishes expert third party reviews of think tank reports. NEPC will house a new Initiative on Diversity, Equity, and Learning (IDEAL), which is funded by the Ford Foundation. NEPC is also the home of the Education Policy Alliance, a nationwide network of university-based research centers and organizations engaged in education policy research.\n\n[4] Apprenticeship: American education reformers have sought to end such tracking, which is seen as a barrier to opportunity. By contrast, the system studied by the NCEE (National Center on Education and the Economy) actually relies much more heavily on tracking. Education officials in the U.S., based largely on school redesign proposals by NCEE and other organizations, have chosen to use criterion-referenced tests that define one high standard that must be achieved by all students to receive a uniform diploma. American education policy under the \"No Child Left Behind Act\" has as an official goal the elimination of the achievement gap between populations. This has often led to the need for remedial classes in college.\n\n[5] Gifted education: The most recent US federal education initiative was signed into law in 2002. The goal of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) is to bring proficiency of all students to grade level, but critics note it does not address the needs of gifted students who perform above grade level. The act imposes punishments on schools, administrators, and teachers when students do not achieve to the plan's designs, but does not address any achievement standards for high functioning students, forcing schools and teachers to spend their time with low achieving students. An article in \"The Washington Post\" declared, \"The unmistakable message to teachers -- and to students -- is that it makes no difference whether a child barely meets the proficiency standard or far exceeds it.\" Gifted services have been recently eroding as a result of the new legislation, according to a 2006 article in \"The New York Times\".\n\n[6] Shopping mall high school: In the 1980s, \"The Shopping Mall High School\" and similar books documented the lack of challenging content in many high school courses. Despite the current policies of mandated student testing and performance-based school funding, evidence from recent reports indicates that the problem of high school students graduating without thoroughly developing many standard intellectual skills persists. In many cases this problem results from the lack of clear state and local standards for what students are expected to learn, and the methods used to teach them. According to the National Center for Educational Achievement, \"the failure of schools, school systems and states to define appropriate standards for high school courses has been a major influence in the move to Advanced Placement and IB courses.\"\n\n[7] Elementary school (United States): Learning Standards are the goals by which states and school districts must meet adequate yearly progress (AYP) as mandated by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). This description of school governance is simplistic at best, however, and school systems vary widely not only in the way curricular decisions are made but also in how teaching and learning take place. Some states and/or school districts impose more top-down mandates than others. In others, teachers play a significant role in curriculum design and there are few top-down mandates. Curricular decisions within private schools are made differently from those made in public schools, and in most cases without consideration of NCLB directives.\n\n[8] Outcome-based education: OBE was introduced to South Africa in the late 1990s by the post-apartheid government as part of its Curriculum 2005 program. , Initial support for the program derived from anti-apartheid education policies. The policy also gained support from the labor movements that borrowed ideas about competency-based education, and Vocational education from New Zealand and Australia, as well as the labor movement that critiqued the apartheid education system. With no strong alternative proposals, the idea of outcome-based education, and a national qualification framework, became the policy of the African National Congress government. This policy was believed to be a democratization of education, people would have a say in what they wanted the outcomes of education to be. It was also believed to be a way to increase education standards and increase the availability of education. The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) went into effect in 1997. In 2001 people realized that the intended effects were not being seen. By 2006 no proposals to change the system had been accepted by the government, causing a hiatus of the program. The program came to be viewed as a failure and a new curriculum improvement process was announced in 2010, slated to be implemented between 2012 and 2014.\n\n[9] Education in the United States: Typically, the curriculum in public elementary education is determined by individual school districthe ts or county school system. The school district selects curriculum guides and textbooks that reflect a state's learning standards and benchmarks for a given grade level. The most recent curriculum that has been adopted by most states is Common Core. Learning Standards are the goals by which states and school districts must meet adequate yearly progress (AYP) as mandated by No Child Left Behind (NCLB). This description of school governance is simplistic at best, however, and school systems vary widely not only in the way curricular decisions are made but also in how teaching and learning take place. Some states or school districts impose more top-down mandates than others. In others, teachers play a significant role in curriculum design and there are few top-down mandates. Curricular decisions within private schools are often made differently from in public schools, and in most cases without consideration of NCLB.\n\n[10] National Policy on Education: The National Policy on Education (NPE) is a policy formulated by the Government of India to promote education amongst India's people. The policy covers elementary education to colleges in both rural and urban India. The first NPE was promulgated in 1968 by the government of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and the second by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1986.  The government of India has appointed a new committee under K. Kasturirangan to prepare a Draft for the new National Education Policy in 2017..\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

It is scored for a SATB choir and organ, and features solos for bass and tenor. Stainer intended that piece would be within the scope of most parish church choirs; it includes five hymns for congregational participation. The text was written by W J Sparrow Simpson, the librettist of Stainer's earlier cantata \"Mary Magdalene\". The work is dedicated \"to my pupil and friend W. Hodge and the choir of Marylebone Church\", who first performed it on February 24, 1887, the day after Ash Wednesday.\n\n[2] Crucifixion (song): Ochs wrote \"Crucifixion\" during a two-hour car ride in the middle of his November 1965 concert tour of the U.K. According to Ochs's manager, Arthur Gorson, the composer was \"wary\" of how his audience might react to the new song because it did not have an explicit political message. He need not have worried; his first public performance of \"Crucifixion\" was greeted by a standing ovation.\n\n[3] The Crucifixion (Stainer): Although the composer Ernest Walker dismissed the work, writing in 1924 that \"Musicians today have no use for \"The Crucifixion\"\", and even Stainer characterized his work as \"rubbish,\" the work continues to be performed today. The oratorio has been recorded several times, including a well-known recording from RCA Victor in 1929, featuring Richard Crooks and Lawrence Tibbett.\n\n[4] Crucifixion (song): Critical response to \"Crucifixion\" was mixed. A writer at \"Beat\" described the song as \"Ochs' most important work to date\" and \"Billboard\" wrote that it was \"very hip\". Robert Christgau, however, wrote that the song \"suffer[s] from elephantiasis of the ambitions\". In March 1967, U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy and journalist Jack Newfield met Ochs, who sang \"Crucifixion\" for them; when Kennedy realized the song was about his brother, tears came to his eyes.\n\n[5] Jacobello del Fiore: While Jacobello's earliest surviving and confirmed work is dated in 1407, he is thought to be the painter of a \"Crucifixion\" piece in the Matthiesen Collection and the \"Virgin and Child\" of Piazzo Giovaneli, both painted in the late 14th century. The Crucifix was a common theme in Jacobello's earliest works, though as a subject it was a fairly common focus of many painters at the time. Art historian Andrea de Marchi was the first to suggest that a single author was responsible for these 'neo-giottoesque' paintings inspired by mainland painters Altichiero and Jacopo Avanzi and coined the author's unknown name as \"Master of the Giovaneli Madonna\". In the Matthiesen \"Crucifixion\", Christ hangs on his cross in the center of the scene, dividing the followers of Christ on the left with the soldiers on the right. These details reveal that the author of the painting must have been familiar with the Late Gothic movement of the mainland and had Venetian training as well, due to the depiction of Longinus who lances Christ and the centurion who orders Christ's legs to be broken, two figures that also appear in Altichiero's \"Crucifixion\" in the Oratorio di San Giorgio, and also the city wall that closes the scene, a technique used by Paolo Veneziano. Similarly, art historian Carlo Volpe noted that a series of small Passion panels painted in the 1390s––\"Agony in the Garden\" (Vatican Picture Gallery), \"Lamentation\" (Vatican Picture Gallery), \"Way to Calvary\" (British Royal Collection), and \"Arrest of Christ (\"private collection)––share a Paduan influence and stylistic similarity with that of the Matthiesen \"Crucifixion\".\" De Marchi also attributes \"The Madonna\n\n[6] Crucifixion (after van Eyck?): Crucifixion is a c. 1440-50 oil on panel painting usually attributed to the workshop of Jan van Eyck, who worked from one of his original designs, or his older brother Hubert. It shows the crucified Christ, attended by his mother Mary, and St. John the Evangelist. The scene is set before an expansive and highly detailed background depiction of Jerusalem. Mary and John are presented in deep sorrow, but more dignified and composed than the wailing women on the left hand side. On the right is a group of horsemen who seem unmoved by the execution, acting as if this was their daily business.\n\n[7] Theodulf of Orléans: Theodulf was also almost certainly responsible for composing the \"Libri Carolini\" (c. 793) which served as a rebuttal to a faulty translation of the acts of the Second Council of Nicaea of 787 which was mistakenly interpreted as saying that the worship (\"adoration\") of images was acceptable in the church. According to it, the Council suggested that an end was to be put to the iconoclastic period which had led to the destruction of many sacred images in the church, especially in Constantinople, which was only partially true. This translation made its way from Rome to the court of Charlemagne where it infuriated the Frankish emperor and his loyal theologians, including Theodulf, who was ordered to write the \"Libri Carolini\" in Charlemagne's name in a way that portrayed him as the sole representative of the Western world and defender of the church against a supposed idolatry.\n\n[8] Crucifixion in the arts: The surrealist Salvador Dalí painted \"Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)\", representing the cross as a hypercube. Fiona Macdonald describes the 1954 painting as showing a classical pose of Christ superimposed on a mathematical representation of the fourth dimension that is both unseeable and spiritual; Gary Bolyer assesses it as \"one of the most beautiful works of the modern era.\" The sculpture \"Construction (Crucifixion): Homage to Mondrian\", by Barbara Hepworth, stands on the grounds of Winchester Cathedral. Porfirio DiDonna's abstract \"Crucifixion\" is one of a number of religious works he painted in the 1960s, \"blending the artist's devotion to the liturgy and his commitment to painting\". The \"Welsh Window\", given to the 16th Street Baptist Church after it was bombed by four Ku Klux Klansmen in 1963, is a work of support and solidarity. The stained glass window depicts a black man, arms outstretched, reminiscent of the crucifixion of Jesus; it was sculpted by John Petts, who also initiated a campaign in Wales to raise money to help rebuild the church.\n\n[9] Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff): Rachmaninoff composed the work in July, 1910 at his summer estate Ivanovka, following his American tour of 1909. Writing to his friend Nikita Morozov, Rachmaninoff said of the work, \"I have been thinking about the \"Liturgy\" for a long time and for a long time I strove to write it. I started to work on it somehow by chance and then suddenly became fascinated with it. And then I finished it very quickly. Not for a long time have I written anything with such pleasure.\"\n\n[10] Sanya Mateyas: In 2004, Sanya Mateyas was one of the composers and performers in I Thirst: The Crucifixion Story, a live performance recorded to DVD, which was inspired by Jesus' crucifixion. The other artists included her sister.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the name of the classification of crime which is less serious than a felony?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Grade (crime): The grade of a crime is its ranking or classification by its degree or seriousness or severity. A felony is more serious than a misdemeanor, which is more serious than an infraction. A first degree felony is more serious than a second degree felony. The severity of punishment is based on the grade of the crime.\n\n[2] Criminal charge: There can be multiple punishments due to certain criminal charges. Minor criminal charges such as misdemeanors, tickets, and infractions have less harsh punishments. The judge usually sentences the person accused of committing the charges right after the hearing. The punishments generally include fines, suspension, probation, a small amount of jail time, or alcohol and drug classes. If the criminal charges are considered more serious like a felony, then there is a more lengthy process for determining the punishment. Felonies include the most serious crimes such as murder and treason. In addition to the trial that decides innocence or guilt, there is a separate trial (after one is convicted) that determines the punishment(s) for the criminal charges committed.\n\n[3] Canadian English: A serious crime is called an indictable offence, while a less-serious crime is called a summary offence. The older words felony and misdemeanour, which are still used in the United States, are not used in Canada's current \"Criminal Code\" (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46) or by today's Canadian legal system. As noted throughout the \"Criminal Code\", a person accused of a crime is called \"the accused\" and not \"the defendant\", a term used instead in civil lawsuits.\n\n[4] Felony: A person who has committed a felony is a felon. In addition, upon conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person is known as a convicted felon or a convict. In the United States, where the felony/misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor. The actual prison sentence handed out has no effect on the classification, which is based on the \"maximum\" sentence possible under law. Individual states may differ in that definition by using other categories, such as seriousness or context.\n\n[5] Particularly serious crime: Particularly serious crime in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the United States is a predecessor of the current aggravated felony. Both of these terms are synonymous in the INA. The term \"particularly serious crime\" was coined for the first time when the U.S. Congress enacted the Refugee Act in 1980. As of September 30, 1996, every aggravated felony conviction for which a sentence of at least 1 year of imprisonment was actually imposed (or more than 2 years of imprisonment could actually have been imposed) by a court of law may qualify as a particularly serious crime. This requires a case-by-case analysis. An offense that involves murder or torture is considered a particularly serious crime even if the possible term of imprisonment is 2 years or less.\n\n[6] Felony: A felony may be punishable with imprisonment for two or more years or death in the case of the most serious felonies, such as murder. Indeed, at common law when the British and American legal systems divorced in 1776, felonies were crimes punishable by either death or forfeiture of property. All felonies remain a serious crime, but concerns of proportionality (i.e., that the punishment fit the crime) have in modern times prompted legislatures to require or permit the imposition of less serious punishments, ranging from lesser terms of imprisonment to the substitution of a jail sentence or even the suspension of all incarceration contingent upon a defendant's successful completion of probation. Standards for measurement of an offense's seriousness include attempts to quantitatively estimate and compare the effects of a crime upon its specific victims or upon society generally.\n\n[7] Race and crime in the United States: A 2016 report by the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites. Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases and 30 percent of battery cases. For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences. One judge responded by noting that about ninety-eight percent of sentences are the result of plea bargaining and that sentencing is a complicated issue given the various facts involved, thus no two cases can be compared. Some attorneys note that poorer defendants often rely on public defenders who often receive less favorable plea offers than defendants with private counsel because private attorneys have lighter case loads, are less likely to go to trial with prosecutors, and defendants with means are more likely to present mitigating factors.\n\n[8] Discrimination based on skin color: A 2016 report by the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites. Blacks were given longer sentences in 60 percent of felony cases, 68 percent of the most serious first-degree crimes, 45 percent of burglary cases and 30 percent of battery cases. For third-degree felonies (the least serious types of felonies in Florida), white judges sentenced blacks to twenty percent more time than whites, whereas black judges gave more balanced sentences.\n\n[9] Murder (United States law): In the United States, the law regarding murder varies by jurisdiction. In most U.S. jurisdictions there is a hierarchy of acts, known collectively as homicide, of which \"first degree murder\" and \"felony murder\" are the most serious, followed by \"second degree murder\", followed by \"voluntary manslaughter\" and involuntary manslaughter which are not as serious, and ending finally in \"justifiable homicide\", which is not a crime at all. However, because there are at least 52 relevant jurisdictions, each with its own criminal code, this is a considerable simplification.\n\n[10] Race and crime: A 2016 report by the \"Sarasota Herald-Tribune\" found that Florida judges sentence black defendants to far longer prison sentences than whites with the same background. For the same drug possession crimes, blacks were sentenced to double the time of whites.

Sulzer had been manufacturing Diesel engines since 1898. The Prussian State Railways ordered a diesel locomotive from the company in 1909, and after test runs between Winterthur and Romanshorn the diesel–mechanical locomotive was delivered in Berlin in September 1912. The world's first diesel-powered locomotive was operated in the summer of 1912 on the Winterthur–Romanshorn railroad in Switzerland, but was not a commercial success. During further test runs in 1913 several problems were found. After the First World War broke out in 1914, all further trials were stopped. The locomotive weight was 95 tonnes and the power was 883 kW with a maximum speed of 100 km/h. Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid-1920s.\n\n[2] History of rail transport: In 1906, Rudolf Diesel, Adolf Klose and the steam and diesel engine manufacturer Gebrüder Sulzer founded Diesel-Sulzer-Klose GmbH to manufacture diesel-powered locomotives.

Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid-1920s. A significant breakthrough occurred in 1914, when Hermann Lemp, a General Electric electrical engineer, developed and patented a reliable direct current electrical control system (subsequent improvements were also patented by Lemp). Lemp's design used a single lever to control both engine and generator in a coordinated fashion, and was the prototype for all diesel–electric locomotive control systems. In 1914, world's first functional diesel–electric railcars were produced for the \"Königlich-Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen\" (Royal Saxon State Railways) by Waggonfabrik Rastatt with electric equipment from Brown, Boveri & Cie and diesel engines from Swiss Sulzer AG. They were classified as . The first regular use of diesel–electric locomotives was in switching (shunter) applications.

Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid-1920s.\n\n[5] GE U25B: The U25B (nicknamed \"U-Boat\") was the first commercially successful domestic diesel electric road locomotive designed, built, and sold by General Electric after its split with the American Locomotive Company (Alco), a company dating back to the steam era. GE had developed internal combustion-electric generating, control, and drive systems in the early 1920s, which provided the foundation for the use of internal combustion engines in railroading. Early applications were in motorized railcars and switch engines. The 1930s saw that technology adapted to high speed mainline locomotives. In 1940 GE partnered with Alco, who by that time were well-established as a manufacturer of Diesel switch engines and were introducing their first Diesel road locomotives. They were successful in building locomotives for switching and short-haul applications, having introduced the first road-switcher design in 1941 (which would supplant the carbody design developed by the Electro-Motive Corporation by the mid-1950s) and gained about a 40% market share during the Dieselization era. Alco-GE's efforts in main line road locomotives had not been successful at breaking into EMD's dominant position in that market, although they introduced a successful gas turbine-electric locomotive to market in 1952. In 1953 GE went independent from Alco in locomotive production, with their new subsidiary GE Rail taking over the gas turbine-electric venture while they sought a supplier of more reliable Diesel engines suitable for road locomotives. Production of Cooper-Bessemer powered Universal Series locomotives began in 1956 and some 400 export locomotives were sold before the U25B was offered in the United States. The U25B was announced by General Electric as a domestic model on April 26, 1960. It was the first locom\n\n[6] Canadian National Railway: In 1929, the CNR made its first experiment with mainline diesel electric locomotives, acquiring two engines from Westinghouse, numbered 9000 and 9001. It was the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service. These early units proved the feasibility of the diesel concept, but were not always reliable. No. 9000 served until 1939, and No. 9001 until 1947. The difficulties of the Great Depression precluded much further progress towards diesel locomotives. The CNR began its conversion to diesel locomotives after World War II, and had fully dieselized by 1960. Most of the CNR's first-generation diesel locomotives were made by General Motors Diesel (GMD) and Montreal Locomotive Works.\n\n[7] Dieselisation: The Great Western Railway introduced diesel railcars in the 1930s and the first British mainline diesel locomotive was built by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1947 but, unlike elsewhere in the developed world, the transition away from steam was delayed during the early postwar years. The delay was driven by two economic considerations: the lower initial cost of steam locomotives for immediate replacement of the large number of locomotives worn out from wartime service, and a projected rise in the cost of petroleum relative to coal, a plentiful domestic resource. Nationalisation of the railways took place in 1948; diesel locomotives were first introduced on a wide scale following the Modernisation Plan of 1955. Poor reliability among the first diesel locomotives used in the Modernisation Plan caused it to be implemented at a slower pace while the problems with the locomotives were worked out during the second half of the 1950s.\n\n[8] Diesel locomotive: In 1924, two diesel–electric locomotives were taken in service by the Soviet railways, almost at one time:In 1935, Krauss-Maffei, MAN and Voith built the first diesel–hydraulic locomotive, called V 140, in Germany. The German railways (DRG) being very pleased with the performance of that engine, diesel–hydraulics became the mainstream in diesel locomotives in Germany. Serial production of diesel locomotives in Germany began after World War II.\n\n[9] Steam locomotive: The first diesel locomotive appeared on the Central Railroad of New Jersey in 1925 and on the New York Central in 1927. Since then, diesel locomotives began to appear in mainline service in the United States in the mid-1930s. The diesel engines reduced maintenance costs dramatically, while increasing locomotive availability. On the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad the new units delivered over a year, compared with about for a mainline steam locomotive. World War II delayed dieselisation in the US. In 1949 the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad became the first large mainline railroad to convert completely to diesel locomotives, and \"Life Magazine\" ran an article on 5 December 1949 titled \"The GM&O puts all its steam engines to torch, becomes first major US railroad to dieselize 100%\". The Susquehanna was one of the earliest railroads in America to fully dieselize by 1947 and retiring their steam locomotives by 1949. The final 2-8-4 Berkshire built was Nickle Plate Road's 779 built in 1949. The last steam locomotive manufactured for general service was a Norfolk and Western 0-8-0, built in its Roanoke shops in December, 1953. In Spring of 1960, Norfolk and Western Y6b 2190 and S1290 doused their fires for the last time in a Williamson, West Virginia roundhouse. 1960 is normally considered the final year of regular Class 1 main line standard gauge steam operation in the United States, with operations on the Grand Trunk Western, Illinois Central, Norfolk and Western and Duluth Missabe and Iron Range Railroads, as well as Canadian Pacific operations in Maine.\n\n[10] Rail transport in the Soviet Union: The Soviet Union was a pioneer in the development of the diesel locomotive to replace the steam locomotive (dieselization) on non-electrified lines. But the USSR failed to make steady progress and while they lead the United States at first, they soon fell behind and their last steam locomotives were retired about 15 years later than for the US. The first mainline diesel locomotive in the world began running in 1924 in the USSR but it had an excessive number of breakdowns so other designs of diesel locomotives were developed and used in desert regions where water for steam locomotives was scarce. Then in 1937 the small scale production (only several units per year) of diesel locomotives (for desert use) came to a halt by order of Kaganovich, the head of the national railway committee (NKPS) and a leading figure in the Communist party.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The San Lorenzo Archipelago is considered one of the most important ecological areas of the Gulf of California. The Island and surrounding areas are part of a rich ecosystem comprised by a grand variety of flora and marine fauna. This area is protected by the Mexican federal government Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001 because of its importance as a habitat for several endangered species. The Archipelago is part of the municipality of Mexicali, Baja California. The island is located southeast of the city separated by the Salsipuedes Channel.\n\n[2] San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park: San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park was created as a marine national park to protect the fragile and important ecosystem of the San Lorenzo Archipelago by national decree on April 25, 2005. The rich marine biodiversity with a significant number of threatened, vulnerable, and endangered species has made it imperative that the Mexican federal government protect this area. This area is also important as a commercial, cultural, and recreation area.\n\n[3] San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park: The park is comprised by the Archipelago islands of San Lorenzo, Las Animas, Salsipuedes, Rasa, and Partida with the surrounding maritime border of the islands with a total area of 50,442 hectares. The Archipelago islands are surrounded by deep, cold water rich in nutrients in the center part of the Gulf of California also known as the Sea of Cortez. Most of the park is comprised by maritime area. The small terrestrial portion consists of rugged islands with irregular coastline eroded with many sea cliffs. The Archipelago islands exhibit dramatic topological changes where elevation goes from sea level to 485m above sea level. The highest elevations are found on San Lorenzo Island towards the southern end.\n\n[4] San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park: San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park has unique ecosystems and habitats. These ecosystems support a great nutritional pyramid important to marine animals, birds, and surrounding human settlements. The rich waters of the Gulf of California is home to over 800 species of fish and 2,000 species of invertebrates.\n\n[5] San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park: The fauna consist of the following list of endangered species: blue whale, humpback whale, killer whale, sperm whale, green turtle, hawksbill turtle, olive ridley turtle, totoaba. The ecosystem of the San Lorenzo Archipelago consists of many varieties of commercially important fish. Swordfish, hake fish, risso dolphin are also common in the waters surrounding the islands. Rasa Island is an important nesting site for Heermann's gull, elegant tern, American oystercatcher, Craveri's murrelet, and brown pelican. Heermann's gull and elegant tern are estimated to reach 260 thousand and 200 thousand respectively which accounts for about 95% of the total world population of that species. Salsipuedes Island, Las Animas Island, and San Lorenzo Island are important reproductive habitat for the brown pelican in the Gulf of California. An average sum of nesting pairs of brown pelicans on the three islands is estimated between 6,000-18,000. The islands also sustain a great number of bird species consisting of native species and migratory species that are attracted to the rich marine ecosystem. Some of the most observed species of birds include: Cooper's hawk, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, Columbidae, magnificent frigatebird, brown pelican, and Nazca booby.\n\n[6] San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park: Climate considered dry desert with an estimated annual rainfall of 2.54 in and an average annual temperature of 75°F. High levels of solar radiation and constant prevailing winds result in high evaporation rates. The San Lorenzo Archipelago Islands experience hot summers where temperatures during the hottest months of the year (July and August) reach between 95°F to 104°F. Winters are warm with an average low temperatures reaching 52°F during the coldest months of the year (January and February). Winds affect the islands' weather, but they have a more significant effect on the sea conditions. Winds prevail from the northwest in the winter which brings nutrient rich waters from the Pacific Ocean into the Gulf of California, but during the summer the winds prevail from the south having the opposite effect on the currents.\n\n[7] San Lorenzo, Valle: A small city park has several concrete marine animals including a shrimp, shark, crab and a pelican for children to play on. A new park was built in late 2007. It is located near La Cabaña and the Miramar Hotel. It includes a monument dedicated to present and past mariners including those that once worked in pangones, transporting wood and other articles from Amapala.\n\n[8] San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park: The islands may seem barren due to the lack of fresh water and arid conditions allowing only a few desert shrubs and cactus. The marine flora consists of several varieties of algae. The algae serves as an ideal habitat for small marine species.\n\n[9] Isla Bastimentos National Marine Park: Isla Bastimentos National Marine Park (in Spanish: Parque Nacional Marino Isla Bastimentos) is a marine park located in the Bocas del Toro District and archipelago of Bocas del Toro Province, Panama. Created in 1988, this is Panama's first national marine park. Covering an area of 13,226-hectares (32,682-acres), of which 11,596 is home to a variety of plant and animal species, the park stretches from Playa Larga (Larga Beach) to the Cayos Zapatillas (Zapatilla Cays) and over to Coral Cay. The national park extends across the southwest side of Isla Bastimentos and into the Caribbean Sea.\n\n[10] Serge Dedina: He is the former Northwest Mexico Program Manager for The Nature Conservancy’s Baja California Program. In his capacity as director Dedina lobbied for the development of the San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park in Baja California, Mexico.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWho was the author of The Coming Anarchy?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] The Coming Anarchy: The Coming Anarchy: How scarcity, crime, overpopulation, tribalism, and disease are rapidly destroying the social fabric of our planet is an influential article written by journalist Robert D. Kaplan, which was first published in the February 1994 edition of \"The Atlantic Monthly\". It is considered to be one of the fundamental theses on the state of current world affairs in the post Cold War era, and is ranked on the same level of doctrinal importance as Samuel Huntington's \"Clash of Civilizations\" and Francis Fukuyama's \"The End of History and the Last Man\" theses. U.S. President Bill Clinton reportedly recommended the article to White House staff. It has also been criticized as a Malthusian reading of the world, for blaming the situation on its victims and for overlooking alleged political and economical causes such as neoliberal policy.\n\n[2] The Coming Anarchy: 20 years after the original publication of the original article, Robert D. Kaplan published a follow up article, entitled \"Why So Much Anarchy?\" , reflecting on the original's article relevance on current events, especially in Arab countries. In this new article, Kaplan recognizes that some of his prophecies, such as a revival of racial violence in America, did not come to be. However, he also stands by some of his more provocative arguments, such as the belief that \"Islam is a religion ideally suited for the urbanizing poor who were willing to \"fight\" [emphasis added]\". He thus mentions the growing popularity of Turkish President Erdogan's conservative Justice and Development Party, largely seen as aligning itself with islamic tendencies, as fulfilling his prediction of the rise of political Islam in Turkey. He also advances further arguments to determine which regimes are bound to fail, notably the presence of a strong, robust bureaucracy, which in turn necessitates a well entrenched middle class. Thus, the arguably successful democratic transition of most former Soviet republics into stable democracies can be explained by a strong bureaucratic apparatus backed by an important middle class. The lack of \"bourgeoise traditions\", on the other hand, can be interpreted as one of the main reasons of the failure of states such as Sierra Leone. Overall, Kaplan sticks to his original narrative, forecasting an inevitable anarchy on vast portions of the world.\n\n[3] Bertram Fletcher Robinson: In 1908, the British author Max Pemberton had a story entitled \"Wheels of Anarchy\" published by Cassell & Company (London). This story is based upon notes that were written by Robinson shortly before his death. It is an adventure tale about anarchists and assassins that is set across Europe. The novel's hero, Bruce Driscoll, is a recent graduate of Jesus College, Cambridge and he appears to be modelled upon Robinson. \"Wheels of Anarchy by Max Pemberton\" was republished in facsimile form in December 2010\n\n[4] Anarchy: The word \"anarchy\" comes from the ancient Greek ἀναρχία (\"anarchia\"), which combines ἀ (\"a\"), \"not, without\" and ἀρχή (\"arkhi\"), \"ruler, authority.\" Thus, the term refers to the state of a society being without authorities or an authoritative governing body.\n\n[5] Anarchy (Busta Rhymes album): Anarchy is the fourth studio album by Busta Rhymes. The album was released on June 20, 2000, by Flipmode Records and Elektra Records. It comes after the release of \"The Coming\", \"When Disaster Strikes\" and \"Extinction Level Event (Final World Front)\". Unlike these albums, \"Anarchy\" does not follow the apocalypse theme. The album debuted at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 164,000 copies. The album would later be certified Platinum by the RIAA. This was Busta's final album with Elektra Records.\n\n[6] Anarchy in Japansuke: The lives of a group of punk-like characters, and their growing maturity, or lack thereof, is explored in a storyline shifting between 1981 and 1989. In contrast to Zeze's usual somber style, and like the later \"Tokyo X Erotica\", \"Anarchy in Japansuke\" is one of the director's lighter films.The film was released theatrically under its full title, \"Anarchy in Japansuke: The Woman Who Comes When Watched\", on April 23, 1999. On October 30, 1999, it was released on DVD in Japan under the shorter title, \"Anarchy in Japansuke\".\n\n[7] The Coming Insurrection: The Coming Insurrection is a French radical leftist, anarchist tract written by The Invisible Committee, the \"nom de plume\" of an anonymous author (or possibly authors). It hypothesizes the \"imminent collapse of capitalist culture\". \"The Coming Insurrection\" was first published in 2007 by Editions La Fabrique, and later (2009) translated into English and published by Semiotext(e). The book is notable for the media coverage which it received as an example of a radical leftist manifesto, particularly from American conservative commentator Glenn Beck. \"The Coming Insurrection\" is also known for its association with the legal case of the Tarnac Nine, a group of nine young people including Julien Coupat who were arrested in Tarnac, rural France, on November 11, 2008 \"\"on the grounds that they were to have participated in the sabotage of overhead electrical lines on France's national railways\"\". The Tarnac Nine were variously accused of conspiracy, sabotage, terrorism, and being the author(s) of \"The Coming Insurrection\".\n\n[8] Leo Tolstoy: In hundreds of essays over the last 20 years of his life, Tolstoy reiterated the anarchist critique of the state and recommended books by Kropotkin and Proudhon to his readers, whilst rejecting anarchism's espousal of violent revolutionary means. In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy\", he wrote; \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about anarchist violence, Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of anarchist thinkers in Russia, and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.\n\n[9] Henry William Carless Davis: In 1899 Davis published \"Balliol College\", a work in the College Histories series, and in 1900, \"Charlemagne\", in the Heroes of the Nations series, as well as articles in the \"English Historical Review\" in 1901. In 1903 he published the article \"The Anarchy of Stephen's Reign\" in the same journal, which presented the idea that the use of the term 'waste' in the Pipe Rolls indicated a much wider devastation resulting from the Anarchy than had been thought, fuelling the belief that a great anarchy occurred during Stephen's reign, although the 'waste' theory was later discredited. His first widely regarded book was \"England under the Normans and Angevins\", published in 1905, it became a standard authority and reached a tenth print edition in 1930. It was, however, his only substantial contribution to narrative medieval history. In 1911 he wrote the summary \"Medieval Europe\", in the Home University Library series, but from 1905 was more focused on editorial work, preparing an edition of Benjamin Jowett's translation of Aristotle's \"Politics\", a revision of William Stubbs' \"Select Charters\" and starting the calendar of royal charters, \"Regesta regum Anglo-Normannorum\".\n\n[10] Max Pemberton: During January 1908, Pemberton had a story entitled \"Wheels of Anarchy\" published by Cassell & Company (London). This story was based upon notes that were written by his friend Bertram Fletcher Robinson shortly before he died in January 1907. It is an adventure tale about anarchists and assassins that is set across Europe.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich body sets the interest rates in the UK?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Chancellor of the Exchequer: Although the Bank of England is responsible for setting interest rates, the chancellor also plays an important part in the monetary policy structure. He sets the inflation target which the Bank must set interest rates to meet. Under the Bank of England Act 1998 the chancellor has the power of appointment of four out of nine members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee – the so-called 'external' members. He also has a high level of influence over the appointment of the Bank's Governor and Deputy Governors, and has the right of consultation over the appointment of the two remaining MPC members from within the Bank. The Act also provides that the Government has the power to give instructions to the Bank on interest rates for a limited period in extreme circumstances. This power has never been officially used.\n\n[2] United Kingdom: The UK has a partially regulated market economy. Based on market exchange rates, the UK is today the fifth-largest economy in the world and the second-largest in Europe after Germany. HM Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government's public finance policy and economic policy. The Bank of England is the UK's central bank and is responsible for issuing notes and coins in the nation's currency, the pound sterling. Banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover their issue. The pound sterling is the world's third-largest reserve currency (after the US dollar and the euro). Since 1997 the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.\n\n[3] Consumer price index by country: The traditional measure of inflation in the UK for many years was the Retail Prices Index (the RPI), which was first calculated in the early 20th Century to evaluate the extent to which workers were affected by price changes during the first world war. An explicit inflation target was first set in October 1992 by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont following the departure of the UK from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Initially, the target was based on the RPIX, which is the RPI calculated excluding mortgage interest payments. This was felt to be a better measure of the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy. It was argued that if interest rates are used to curb inflation, then including mortgage payments in the inflation measure would be misleading. Until 1997, interest rates were set by the Treasury.\n\n[4] United Kingdom enterprise law: UK banking has two main parts. First, the Bank of England administers monetary policy, influencing interest rates, inflation and employment, and it regulates the banking market with HM Treasury, the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority. Second, there are private banks, and some non-shareholder banks (co-operatives, mutual or building societies), that provide credit to consumer and business clients. Borrowing money on credit (and repaying the debt later) is important for people to expand a business, invest in a new enterprise, or purchase valuable assets more quickly than by saving. Every day, banks estimate the prospects of a borrower succeeding or failing, and set interest rates for debt repayments according their predictions of the risk (or average risk of ventures like it). If all banks together lend more money, this means enterprises will do more, potentially employ more people, and if business ventures are productive in the long run, society's prosperity will increase. If banks charge interest that people cannot afford, or if banks lend too much money to ventures that are unproductive, economic growth will slow, stagnate, and sometimes crash. Although UK banks, except the Bank of England, are shareholder or mutually owned, many countries operate public retail banks (for consumers) and public investment banks (for business). The UK used to run Girobank for consumers, and there have been many proposals for a \"British Investment Bank\" (like the Nordic Investment Bank or KfW in Germany) since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008, but these proposals have not yet been accepted. The Bank of England provides finance and support to, and may influence interest rates of the private banks through monetary policy. It was originally established as a corporation with private shareholders under the Bank of England Act 1694, to raise money for war with Louis XIV, King of France. After the South Sea Company collapsed in a speculative bubble\n\n[5] Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom): An explicit inflation target was first set in October 1992 by Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, following the UK's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Initially, the target was based on the RPIX, which is the RPI calculated excluding mortgage interest payments. This was felt to be a better measure of the effectiveness of macroeconomic policy. It was argued that if interest rates are used to curb inflation, then including mortgage payments in the inflation measure would be misleading. Until 1997, interest rates were set by the Treasury.\n\n[6] Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom): On election in May 1997, the new Labour government handed control over interest rates to the politically independent Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee. This committee is given the responsibility of adjusting interest rates in order to meet an inflation target set by the Chancellor. The initial target rate of inflation was an RPIX of 2.5%. The committee meets once per month to decide if any changes to the interest rate are necessary. If, in any month, inflation deviates from the target by more than one percentage point, the Governor of the Bank of England is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor explaining the reasons for this and to propose a plan of action for bringing inflation back towards the target.\n\n[7] Tuition fees in the United Kingdom: Students pay interest on loans. In 2012 this rate was set at the retail price index (RPI) plus up to 3% depending on income. Students who started university between 1998 and 2011 pay Bank of England base rate plus 1%. Students who started university before 1998 pay interest set at the RPI rate. As a consequence of the 2012 change, students who graduate in 2017 will pay between 3.1% and 6.1% interest, despite the Bank of England base rate being 0.25%.\n\n[8] Inflation targeting: The United Kingdom adopted inflation targeting in October 1992 after exiting the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee was given sole responsibility in 1998 for setting interest rates to meet the Government's Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target changed to 2% in December 2003 when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the UK Treasury's inflation index. If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor of the Bank of England is required to write a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation. The success of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the Bank's focus on transparency. The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which have been emulated by many other central banks.\n\n[9] Norman Lamont: Within the constraints of the ERM, sterling interest rates were cut seven times in 1991, falling from 14% to 10.5% in September, with inflation halving from 9.0% to 4.5% over the course of the year, leaving real interest rates just 0.5% lower. The scope for swifter cuts in interest rates was squeezed by an event that few had anticipated when Britain joined the ERM: based on OECD indices of consumer prices, inflation in Germany, which had been 2.7% in 1990, rose to 5.1% in 1992, whilst in Britain inflation fell from 7.0% to 4.3%. In response, the Bundesbank increased its discount rate from 6.0% in 1990 to 8.75% in July 1992, creating the conditions for the turbulence the ERM was to experience later that autumn. Because of rising German rates, Lamont was only able to cut interest rates by a further 0.5% to 10% in May 1992, when UK conditions would arguably have warranted deeper cuts.\n\n[10] United Kingdom banking law: The Bank of England provides finance and support to, and may influence interest rates of the private banks through monetary policy. Possibly the Bank's most important function is administering monetary policy. This affects growth and employment. Under BEA 1998 section 11 its objectives are to (a) \"maintain price stability, and (b) subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.\" Under section 12, the Treasury issues its interpretation of \"price stability\" and \"economic policy\" each year, together with an inflation target. To change inflation, the Bank of England has three main policy options. First, it performs \"open market operations\", buying and selling banks' bonds at differing rates (i.e. loaning money to banks at higher or lower interest, known \"discounting\"), buying back government bonds (\"repos\") or selling them, and giving credit to banks at differing rates. This will affect the interest rate banks charge by influencing the quantity of money in the economy (more spending by the central bank means more money, and so lower interest) but also may not. Second, the Bank of England may direct banks to keep different higher or lower reserves proportionate to their lending. Third, the Bank of England could direct private banks adopt specific deposit taking or lending policies, in specified volumes or interest rates. The Treasury is, however, only meant to give orders to the Bank of England in \"extreme economic circumstances\". This should ensure that changes to monetary policy are undertaken neutrally, and artificial booms are not manufactured before an election.Outside the central bank, banks are mostly run as profit-making corporations, without meaningful representation for customers. This means, the standard rules in the Companies Act 2006 apply.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The nearest brown dwarfs are the binary Luhman 16 system at 6.6 light-years. Other systems within ten light-years are the binary red-dwarf system Luyten 726-8 (8.7 ly) and the solitary red dwarf Ross 154 (9.7 ly). The closest solitary Sun-like star to the Solar System is Tau Ceti at 11.9 light-years. It has roughly 80% of the Sun's mass but only 60% of its luminosity. The closest known free-floating planetary-mass object to the Sun is WISE 0855−0714, an object with a mass less than 10 Jupiter masses roughly 7 light-years away. Compared to many other planetary systems, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury. The known Solar System also lacks super-Earths (Planet Nine could be a super-Earth beyond the known Solar System). Uncommonly, it has only small rocky planets and large gas giants; elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typical—both rocky and gas—so there is no \"gap\" as seen between the size of Earth and of Neptune (with a radius 3.8 times as large). Also, these super-Earths have closer orbits than Mercury. This led to hypothesis that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection.\n\n[2] C/1989 X1: More observations were soon made, establishing the comet's orbit, and it was found that it will pass through its perihelion (the point of its orbit where it is closest to the Sun) on 9 April 1990 at a distance of about 53 million kilometres, inside the orbit of Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun.\n\n[3] 40 Eridani: In 2018, a planet was discovered orbiting 40 Eridani A with a minimum mass of Earth masses. The planet has an orbit of 42 days, and lies considerably interior to the habitable zone, receiving 9 times more stellar flux than Earth, which is an even greater stellar flux amount than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system, on average receives from our Sun. It is one of the closest Super-Earths known, the closest discovered to date () within a multiple star system.\n\n[4] 2013 RF98: It came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) around October 2009 and was last observed in September 2016. , it is 36.6 AU from the Sun. Of the seven objects whose aligned orbits suggest the existence of Planet Nine, it is currently the closest to the Sun. It will be 18.7 AU from Uranus in 2021. It will be in the constellation of Cetus until 2022. It comes to opposition at the start of November.\n\n[5] Interstellar travel: Distances between the planets in the Solar System are often measured in astronomical units (AU), defined as the average distance between the Sun and Earth, some . Venus, the closest other planet to Earth is (at closest approach) 0.28 AU away. Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, is 29.8 AU away. As of January 2018, Voyager 1, the farthest man-made object from Earth, is 141.5 AU away.\n\n[6] C/2010 X1 (Elenin): C/2010 X1 made its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on 10 September 2011 at a distance of . The remnant of Elenin made its closest approach to Earth on 16 October 2011, at a distance of or slightly closer than the planet Venus, at a relative velocity of 86,000 km/h. Before the August fading of the comet, the Minor Planet Center ephemeris projected that the originally bright comet Elenin would reach about 6th magnitude in September and October 2011, but the brightness depends on the activity level of the coma. But because Elenin disintegrated, it did not become visible to the naked eye or binoculars. Elenin made its closest apparent pass in the night sky to Comet 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdušáková on the morning of October 8, and moved apparently close to Mars on October 15. The comet came to opposition at 178° from the Sun on March 14, 2011 and came to opposition again on November 22, 2011 at 175° from the Sun. The minimum angle between the Sun and comet occurred on September 26 (1.9°), and between July 28 and October 10 the comet was less than 45 degrees from the Sun.\n\n[7] List of Solar System objects by greatest aphelion: The exact furthest distance from the Sun (aphelion) can be very different depending on the object's position in its orbit, as well as the epoch. An incoming asteroid could be slowed down by Jupiter, making its orbit closer to the Sun. The aphelion distance for heliocentric orbits (only taking into account the present location of the Sun as the orbited mass) can be highly inaccurate for objects with an orbital eccentricity approaching 1 (a hyperbolic orbit not bound to the Solar System) especially when the orbit is calculated while the object is near its closest point to the Sun and has not left the planetary region of the Solar System, where it passes closest to planets which could alter its orbit significantly. Barycentric solutions are more accurate because they account for the combined gravity of the Sun and the most massive planet Jupiter. An epoch of 2200 has all of these objects well outside of the planetary region of the Solar System. In 2200, comet C/2012 S4 will be from the Sun.These can also change significantly such as if perturbed by Jupiter\n\n[8] Solar System: There are relatively few stars within ten light-years of the Sun. The closest is the triple star system Alpha Centauri, which is about 4.4 light-years away. Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun-like stars, whereas the small red dwarf, Proxima Centauri, orbits the pair at a distance of 0.2 light-year. In 2016, a potentially habitable exoplanet was confirmed to be orbiting Proxima Centauri, called Proxima Centauri b, the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun. The stars next closest to the Sun are the red dwarfs Barnard's Star (at 5.9 ly), Wolf 359 (7.8 ly), and Lalande 21185 (8.3 ly).\n\n[9] Sirius: At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight nearest stars to the Solar System (not including the Sun), and is the fifth closest stellar system to ours (again not including the Sun). This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as α Centauri and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as Canopus, Rigel or Betelgeuse. It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun. The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is Procyon, 1.61 parsecs (5.24 ly) away. The \"Voyager 2\" spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four Jovian planets in the Solar System, is expected to pass within of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years.\n\n[10] Subsolar point: The subsolar point on a planet is the point at which its sun is perceived to be directly overhead (at the zenith); that is, where the sun's rays strike the planet exactly perpendicular to its surface. It can also mean the point closest to the sun on an astronomical object, even though the sun might not be visible. To an observer on a planet with an orientation and rotation similar to those of Earth, the subsolar point will appear to move westward, completing one circuit around the globe each day, approximately moving along the equator. However, it will also move north and south between the tropics over the course of a year, so it is spiraling like a helix.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Then she went on recording some Hindi songs under A. R. Rahman's compositions from 1991-1995, her breakthrough in Hindi film music came through \"Kehna Hi Kya\" from the film \"Bombay\" (1995), which was highly successful in the North Indian region and gave her an identity in Bollywood film industry (\"Kehna Hi Kya\" was included in The Guardian newspaper's \"The 1000 songs that everyone must hear\"). For the song \"Payalein Chunmun\" recorded in the 1997 film \"Virasat\", Chithra received the National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer and became the only South India based female singer till date to achieve the feat. Her most number of Hindi songs were recorded for Anu Malik, the most notable being her voice recorded for eight songs out of eleven in the soundtrack of \"Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon\" in 2003.\n\n[2] K.

The Hindi version of the song was also sampled by Ciara for her 2009 song \"Turntables\", featuring Chris Brown.\n\n[4] Teree Sang: A lawyer fights the case about teen pregnancy, and Kabir is charged. Having come to agree to the couple's relationship, Maahi's father opposed the lawyer. Kabir is sentenced 3 months' remand.The soundtrack album has eight songs composed by Sachin–Jigar, Anu Malik and Bappi Lahiri. All lyrics written by Sameer and Virag Mishra. The film received a range of responses. Some people have welcomed the new thinking about young people having babies. \"Preity Zinta\", starring Kya Kehna, was the first to explore this. \"Kya Kehna\" was another film on this topic, which became a superhit.\n\n[5] List of Hindi songs recorded by K. S. Chithra: Some of Chithra's memorable Hindi songs include \"Ye Haseen Wadiyan\" from \"Roja\", \"Yaaron Sun Lo\" from \"Rangeela\", \"Hum Tumse Na\" from \"Ziddi\", \"Payale Chunmun\" from \"Virasat\" (she won a National Award, Star Screen Award and the nomination for FilmfareAwards for her rendition), \"Raat Ka Nasha\" from \"Aśoka\", \"Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya (sad version)\", \"Rang De Basanti\" title track, \"Mere Dil Ka Tumse Hi Kehna\" from \"Armaan\" , \"Mere Dil Ka Tumse Hi Kehna\" from the film \"Armaan\" In the composition of Rajesh Roshan, she has sung \"Koi Mil Gaya\" title song of the film \"Koi... Mil Gaya\" for which she won Bollywood Movie Awards, MTV Immies Award and the nomination for Filmfare Awards. \"Tum Bin Jiya Jaye Kaise\" from the film \"Tum Bin\" topped the charts and she was lauded for her expressive rendition.\n\n[6] Kya Kehna: Vinayak Chakravorty of \"Hindustan Times\" gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, writing, \"The basic premise of Kya Kehna!, then, definitely had the potential of being a gripping family entertainer. Unfortunately, somewhere down the line you feel as if most people associated with the film somehow lost interest.\" He noted, however, Preity Zinta as \"the bright spot of the film\". Aradhika Sekhon of \"The Tribune\" wrote, \"The movie itself has several flaws but the issues that it tackles are real. The director takes a straight, hard look at the problems of today and holds them up for exhibition. The Indian tendency is to sweep uncomfortable issues under the carpet but if films like Kya Kehna continue to be made, at least, we'll be forced to confront them.\" Mimmy Jain of \"The Indian Express\", in a positive review, commeded Shah for making \"a sensitive film, on a sensitive subject\", calling \"Kya Kehna\" \"a film that should have been made years ago\". She further noted Zinta as being \"dazzlingly good\" in her part.\n\n[7] Chhookar Mere Man Ko Kiya Toone Kya Ishaara: \"Chhookar Mere Man Ko Kiya Toone Kya Ishaara\" is a song from the 1981 Hindi film \"Yaarana\", sung by Kishore Kumar.

However, \"Hawa Hawaii\" and \"Karte Hain Hum Pyaar Mr. India Se\", two popular songs from the equally popular movie \"Mr. India\" \"(1986) - Karte Hain Hum pyaar Mr. India se,\" roved to be a turning point in her career. (The songs were composed by music composers Laxmikant-Pyarelal, the latter being a duet with Kishore Kumar and lip-synced on screen by actress Sridevi.) Her collaboration with Laxmikant-Pyarelal produced several hits.\n\n[9] Waah! Tera Kya Kehna: Waah! Tera Kya Kehna (English: \"Wow!

Martin was making the first defence of the belt that he won in January after defeating Vyacheslav Glazkov for the vacant title in January 2016. Joshua set the pace in the first round and kept the southpaw Martin at bay before sending him to the canvas with a straight right hand in the second round. Martin got to his feet only to be knocked down for a second time by a similar punch just moments later. This time Martin failed to beat the count after taking too long to get up, and the referee waved the fight off, with Joshua winning his first world title.\n\n[2] Anthony Joshua: Promoter Eddie Hearn announced a 3-man shortlist from IBF's top ranking 15 boxers for Joshua's first defence of his title. This included former WBC heavyweight champion Bermane Stiverne (25-1-2, 21 KOs) and Eric Molina (25-3, 19 KOs), both of whom were recently beaten by American WBC champion Deontay Wilder, alongside unbeaten upcoming fighter Dominic Breazeale (17-0, 15 KOs). On 25 April, it was announced that Joshua's next fight will be against Dominic Breazeale on 25 June 2016 at the O2 Arena in London. Breazeale was ranked 13th by IBF below British pair Derek Chisora and David Haye. Breazeale became only the second boxer, after Dillian Whyte, to take Joshua past 3 rounds. After a dominant performance, Joshua successfully defended his IBF heavyweight title with a seventh-round knockout win. Breazeale was dropped heavily by a huge left hand. After the fight, Eddie Hearn said Joshua could next fight IBF mandatory Joseph Parker, around November. The fight averaged 289,000 viewers on Showtime in the afternoon. The card averaged 227,000 viewers.\n\n[3] Anthony Joshua: It was announced in August that Joshua would be making a second defence of his IBF title at the Manchester Arena in Manchester on 26 November. This would mark the first time since September 2014 that Joshua would be fighting in the city. Possible names put forward for the fight were top IBF contenders Kubrat Pulev and Joseph Parker. Former unified heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko became the front-runner after his scheduled rematch with Tyson Fury was cancelled a second time.\n\n[4] Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko: It was announced in August 2016 that Joshua would be making a second defence of his IBF title at the Manchester Arena on 26 November. This would mark the first time since September 2014 that Joshua would be fighting in the city. Possible names put forward for the fight were top IBF contenders Kubrat Pulev, Bermane Stiverne, Hughie Fury and Joseph Parker. Former unified heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko became the frontrunner after his scheduled rematch with Tyson Fury was cancelled for a second time.\n\n[5] Anthony Joshua vs. Joseph Parker: Anthony Joshua vs. Joseph Parker, billed as \"Road to Undisputed\", was a professional boxing heavyweight unification match contested between Anthony Joshua and Joseph Parker. The event took place on 31 March 2018 at Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, with Joshua's IBF, WBA (Super) and IBO heavyweight titles and Parker's WBO heavyweight title on the line. Joshua won the fight in a unanimous points decision with two judges scoring it 118–110 and the other 119–109.\n\n[6] Anthony Joshua: In February 2014, Joshua scored a 2nd-round TKO victory over Dorian Darch to take his record to 4-0. The following month, on the undercard of Ricky Burns against Terence Crawford, Joshua defeated Hector Alfredo Avila with a 1st-round KO, in Glasgow, Scotland. In May that year Joshua knocked out Matt Legg in one round on the undercard of Carl Froch vs. George Groves II at Wembley Stadium. In Joshua's seventh professional fight, on 12 July 2014, in the Echo Arena, Liverpool, he defeated Englishman Matt Skelton via 2nd round stoppage. In Anthony Joshua's eighth professional fight, on 13 September 2014, against German heavyweight Konstantin Airich, Joshua took his undefeated record to 8-0 with a 3rd round stoppage victory, in the Manchester Arena.\n\n[7] Anthony Joshua: Joshua was in the Main-Event of a Matchroom Sport card for the second time in his career, in his 9th professional appearance for the vacant WBC International heavyweight title against former champion looking to win the title for a second time Denis Bakhtov on 11 October 2014 at The O2 Arena in London. Joshua won the fight by knockout in the second round taking his record to 9-0 and then winning the WBC International heavyweight Title aged just 24.\n\n[8] Anthony Joshua vs. Joseph Parker: Joshua was forced to go the distance to defeat Parker via a 12-round unanimous decision to claim the WBO title as well as retain his WBA, IBF and IBO belts. The judges scored the fight 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109 in favour of Joshua. Many media outlets including ESPN had the fight around 116-112 with Joshua the clear winner. With going the distance, Joshua's 20 fight knockout streak came to an end. Parker used his movement well to slip a lot of Joshua's attack but in doing so did not do enough himself to win more rounds. Parker started on the backfoot in the opening rounds allowing Joshua to take the rounds. There was an accidental clash of heads in round 3, however neither boxer was cut from this. There was another accidental head-butt in round 9 where the referee called for a short break. Joshua's tape on his left glove kept coming loose and he was ordered to go back to his corner for a re-tape. Parker suffered a cut over his left eye after Joshua accidentally elbowed him. In round 12, neither boxers engaged as much as expected with Joshua trying to track Parker down, who again, on the backfoot looked to survive the round. The fight was marred by Italian referee Giuseppe Quartarone, who kept both boxers from fighting on the inside. This mostly had negative impact on Parker, where he was seen to have the most success. The referee was breaking the action each time both boxers were on the inside, even when they were still throwing shots. Many boxers, pundits and both the Sky Sports and Showtime broadcast team criticised the referee during and after the fight.\n\n[9] Dereck Chisora: After a period of eight months without a fight since his defeat to Fury, Chisora won five fights in five months against some lowly ranked European opponents which helped set up a fight for the recently vacated European heavyweight title against highly ranked Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev in Hamburg on 7 May 2016. The bout was also an eliminator for the IBF heavyweight title. Despite what had seemed a fairly comfortable points win for Pulev the fight ended in a split decision, with two judges scoring it 118–110 and 116–112 in Pulev's favour while the third scored it 115–113 for Chisora. The defeat left Chisora's chances of a world title shot against IBF champion Anthony Joshua in doubt.\n\n[10] Anthony Joshua: Joshua was forced to go the distance for the first time in his 19-0 knockout career, to defeat Parker, via a 12-round unanimous decision to claim the WBO title, as well as retain his WBA, IBF and IBO belts.

The bus that was involved was carrying Chinese tourists. At 12:57 on July 19, 2016, on State Road at the 2nd West Park section, a bus operated by Red Coral Bus Team, with the license plate number 197-EE, having driven to within 4.2 km of Taoyuan airport, suddenly became on fire and started burning. The bus continued forwards for 2.9 km until it collided with a guardrail on the left side. After the driver swerved the bus to the right, it then collided with the right guardrail, after which tourists on the bus from Dalian walked to the back door to escape, but the door was jammed by the guardrail broken in the crash and could only open 10 cm wide, making escape impossible. Afterwards, a gravel truck driver saw the fire and quickly notified a policeman surnamed Lin. Together, they attempted a rescue by breaking the bus windows but were not successful, and eventually the entire bus was consumed by the blaze, causing all 26 passengers to die. This was the most serious bus accident in Taiwan that occurred in 2016, and also the most serious one since the 2010 Suhua Highway bus accident. BBC, The Guardian, the Wall Street Journal, NHK, Yomiuri Shimbun, CNN, the Daily Mirror, and various international media have made reports. An investigation by the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office found out that the bus driver had purposefully crashed after dousing the bus with gasoline and lighting it on fire.\n\n[2] 2016 Taoyuan bus fire: September 10, the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office concluded its investigation, and found Su Mingcheng guilty of premeditated arson and self-immolation. His family had long been aware of his want to commit suicide.Two crew were killed including a tour guide and the driver, who deliberately caused the incidents. The rest of the deceased were mainland Chinese tourists.\n\n[3] 2016 Taoyuan bus fire: During a tour at 12:57, the bus was passing through the State Road II, 4.2 km to the west of the Dayuan road section, and a fire appeared at the front of the vehicle. The bus swayed along the left inside lane of the road for quite some time, up to 2.8 or 2.9 kilometers. The bus then suddenly lost control, and the whole vehicle hit a guardrail on the left, then swerved to the right side, crashing into the rail there also. A policeman and a male civilian with hand-held extinguishers started trying to smash windows and rescue youths trapped in the burning vehicle. The fire was extinguished at 13:21, after about half an hour, but because heavy smoke quickly filled the confined space of the vehicle, everyone located inside the vehicle, including Su Mingcheng, the Taiwanese tour bus driver, tour guide Zheng Kun Wen, as well as 24 visitors of mainland Chinese citizenship, had no time to escape, and were killed on the spot either by burning, high temperature exposure, or suffocation on smoke and other toxic gases. Multiple burnt corpses were stacked together at the escape door located behind five seat rows. Despite there being eight escape doors, they all a built-in lock that passengers did not know how to operate. Also, the rear bus door was jammed by the broken guardrail, and the thick obscuring smoke prevented the timely striking of the safety window's corners. The vehicle was burned, and the fire left only charred skeletons.\n\n[4] 2016 Taoyuan bus fire: Initial investigations revealed that the escape door lock had a built-in lock, so you could not push open the door to escape. This is a major reason for fatal accidents in Taiwan. Investigator's initial impression of the cause of the fire was a wire from a short circuit and friction. Further the vehicles transformer voltage, originally 24 volts, had an unauthorized boost to 110 volts. The transformer powered the water dispenser, refrigerator, sockets, etc. Whether or not the fire was due to voltage instability caused by a short circuit was still to be investigated. There were also arguments that because of the tour company was a low-fare low-cost group, and relied on clients shopping to fill commission expenses and control costs, they could not afford to meet the safety standards.\n\n[5] 2016 Taoyuan bus fire: On July 29, the driver remained in the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office and test results showed that driver had before suspected of drunk driving. It could not be ruled out of the possibility of self-immolation. The possibility emerged of a murder-suicide by arson.\n\n[6] 2016 Taoyuan bus fire: In addition, Su Mingcheng also broke the news on October 11, 2013 when guiding a group of mainland tourists. During the tour, in the Hualien City a sexual assault on a female occurred, and the Hualien District Court of First Instance sentenced him to 5 years in prison. He appealed and a second trial occurred on June 24, 2016.\n\n[7] 2016 Taoyuan bus fire: Out of the 37 incidents in Taiwan since 2006 involving operating buses and smoke and fire accidents, this is the first incident where the vehicle was completely destroyed in the accident.\n\n[8] Xiamen bus fire: Preliminary investigations conducted by the traffic police indicate that at around 6:22 p.m. CST, a Xiamen BRT bus, license plate , carrying 90 passengers, caught fire on an elevated roadway between the Caitang () and Jinshan () bus stops. The fire broke out in the rear end of the bus and once it had spread to the fuel tank, the bus exploded. The fire was extinguished at around 6:50 pm CST (10:50 UTC), twenty minutes after the bus caught fire during the evening rush hour. Following the fire, the entire BRT system was temporarily shut down, reopening the following day.\n\n[9] Xinyang bus fire: On 22 July 2011 at 04:00 Beijing Time (20:00 UTC on the 21st), a bus fire occurred in Xinyang, Henan, causing the deaths of at least 41 people. The fire occurred on China National Highway 105, which links Beijing to Zhuhai, Guangdong. There were 47 passengers on board, but the bus was designed to hold only 35 passengers. As the bus was overloaded, some passengers were sleeping in the aisle at the time of the fire, which began at 4 a.m. Voice of America initially reported that the bus was carrying hazardous goods. Some of the survivors reported hearing an explosion at the back of the vehicle when the fire started. Six people, including the driver, survived and were hospitalized. In August it was confirmed that the fire was started by the chemicals being illegally transported on the bus.\n\n[10] 2014 Fundación bus fire: The bus was returning from an event at a Christian church in Fundación. The bus was having problems, so the driver stopped and attempted to fix them. He began pouring fuel into the engine through the floor of the cabin. This, along with a gasoline container that was already inside the bus, set the bus on fire.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhen did Théodore Chabert enlisted in Frencg Royal Army?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Théodore Chabert: Théodore Chabert (16 March 1758 – 17 April 1845) became a French brigade commander during the French Revolutionary Wars. He enlisted in the French Royal Army in 1774. He was promoted lieutenant colonel at the Siege of Lyon in 1793. He joined the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees as a general of brigade and led his troops at Boulou, the Black Mountain and Rosas. He served with the Army of the Alps from 1795 to 1798 when he was elected a member of the Council of Five Hundred. He missed the fighting in 1800. He opposed Napoleon's appointment as Consul for Life in 1802.\n\n[2] Théodore Chabert: Chabert was sent to Spain as a brigade commander in 1808. When Pierre Dupont de l'Etang's corps was surrounded after the Battle of Bailén, Chabert was one of the French generals who negotiated the capitulation. For this, Napoleon threw him in prison after the Spanish released him. After some time, he was released but remained unemployed and watched by the police. Yet, in 1809 he was appointed Baron of the Empire. In 1814 Chabert volunteered his services and fought at Saint-Julien. During the Hundred Days Napoleon promoted him general of division and appointed him to lead the 5th National Guard Division in Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's corps in the Alps. Under the Bourbon Restoration he was demoted. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 26.\n\n[3] Guy Charmot: In September 1939, Charmot awaited an assignment to French West Africa. He was a physician for the 49th Colonial Field Artillery Regiment, but he wanted to stay in France. However, he was sent to Africa against his will after working along the Maginot Line. He left Bordeaux in March 1940 for Dakar. In June 1941, Charmot left French West Africa for Syria. He stayed in Damascus for about a month, and then left for Berbera, Somalia. In 1943, Charmot was sent to Tunisia and aided Allied troops as they took North Africa back from the Germans. After that, he helped aid troops in liberating France and Italy. At the end of the war, Charmot became a doctor-captain for his work in World War II. As a member of the French Defence Health Service, he was a doctor in many French colonies, such as Senegal, Congo, and Madagascar until 1965. Once the French officially decolonized, Charmot moved back to France. He was a specialist in tropical medicine, and participated in therapeutic research for Rhône-Poulenc. He was also a consultant for Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital.\n\n[4] André Sordet: Born on 17 May 1852 at Saint-Germain-du-Plain in the Saône-et-Loire department, the son of Claude Alfred Sordet and Marguerite Marie de la Blanche. Sordet was commissioned into the 57th Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant in November 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. In September 1871, he attended the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr and specialised in the cavalry arm. By August 1903, Sordet had been promoted to \"General de brigade\" and was given command of the 5th Dragoon Brigade, followed by command of 5th Cavalry Division in September 1907, 4th Cavalry Division in April 1910 and X Army Corps in May 1912. He was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in July 1893, an Officer in July 1904 and a Commander in December 1912. In 1914, Sordet commanded the I Cavalry Corps. General Joseph Joffre, the French Commander-in-Chief, believed that the main German thrust would be towards Verdun, but when Germany demanded passage of her troops through Belgium, he sent Sordet's corps into the Belgian Ardennes region to reconnoitre in force on 5 August.\n\n[5] Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle: He entered the army in 1789 at private rank, in the 2nd mounted chasseurs regiment and fought with distinction in nearly all the campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars in the armies fighting on the River Rhine, and then from 1792 to year 1801 in the armée du Rhin, the armée de Rhin-et-Moselle, the armée d'Allemagne, the armée d'Angleterre, the armée de Mayence, the armée d'Italie. Wounded several times, Bordessoulle was made sous-lieutenant in August 1794, then lieutenant in July 1796 and captain in January 1798. He fought with panache at Novi on 15 August 1799, being wounded again whilst covering the army's retreat. He rose rapidly through the ranks, being promoted to chef d'escadron in the 6th Hussards in May 1799 and receiving an honorary sabre in 1802.\n\n[6] Albert Desbrisay Carter: In November 1914 he was seconded from the N.B. Rangers as a volunteer for the 26th (New Brunswick) Battalion C.E.F. His wartime army service is well documented in his personnel file.  He went overseas with his unit in Jun 1915 as lieutenant and machine gun officer. The 26th Battalion reached France in September 1915. Carter was wounded in the action of 14 October 1915, taking a piece of shrapnel in the right thigh. After treatment in England he was granted sick furlough home to New Brunswick. Towards the end of his convalescence he received permission to accept a company command in the 140th (New Brunswick) Battalion, then in formation. This meant a promotion from lieutenant directly to major. With his new rank and responsibilities Carter returned to England in September 1916. There being an over-abundance of inexperienced senior officers, Cater was employed for a number of months in the reserve training division, first with the Royal Canadian Regiment depot, and subsequently with the 13th Reserve Battalion of the New Brunswick Regiment, which provided reinforcements to his old unit in France, the 26th.\n\n[7] Charles de Gaulle: De Gaulle was not an outstanding pupil until his mid-teens, but from July 1906 he worked harder at school as he focused on winning a place to train as an army officer at the military academy, Saint-Cyr. Lacouture suggests that de Gaulle joined the army, despite being by inclination more suited to a career as a writer and historian, partly to please his father and partly because it was one of the few unifying forces which represented the whole of French society. He later wrote that \"when I entered the Army, it was one of the greatest things in the world\", a claim which Lacouture points out needs to be treated with caution: the army's reputation was at a low ebb in the early 1900s after the Dreyfus Affair. It was used extensively for strike-breaking and there were fewer than 700 applicants for St Cyr in 1908, down from 2,000 at the turn of the century.\n\n[8] Jean Brette: Following the independence, he was repatriated with his unit to the camp Sissone on September 6, 1962 and followed the courses at the center of Germanic studies from October 1, 1962 until August 3, 1963.  He was then assigned to the general staff headquarters of the French Forces in Germany FFA () on September 1963, the integrated the 80th promotion of the Superior War School and the general staff headquarters school, on June 1, 1966.  He was promoted to Chef de bataillon (Commandant - Major) on October 1.  In June 1968, he was assigned to the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment 1 RCP at Pau Idron in quality as an Instructor Director.  He then served in the infantry inspection, as an officer of the general staff headquarters, from July 1, 1970. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-colonel on December 1, 1972.  Designated to command a troop corps, he received the regimental colors of the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2 REP, on June 29, 1974. He was promoted to the rank of Colonel on October 1, 1975. During this calm operational period, he dedicated himself to decorate camp Raffali, notably by conducting a campaign of planting trees and vegetation around the regiment.  In February 1976, one of his turning units at TFAI, intervened with success in the Children Hostage Rescue Affair of Loyada (). Following his commandment tenure, he was assigned to the general staff headquarters of the 3rd Armored Division of the French Forces in Germany, FFA () at Fribourg on July 1, 1976.  In 1978, he was auditor () at\n\n[9] Jean Berthiaume: As the war broke out, then Lieutenant Berthiaume continued training his troops in St-Hyacinthe. He was transferred to the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade at camp Debert in Nova Scotia for preparatory training as GSO with the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. He then went to the Canadian Army Command and Staff College in Kingston and after shipped to England. Most of the Canadians in reinforcement stayed in England for almost two years (1942–1944) until D-Day. When arriving in France, as GSO 3 Operations, then captain Berthiaume aided in the orientation of some operations towards the ultimate victory. By the end of the conflict, he was transferred to the 1st Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n[10] Charles-Henri Delacroix: On 4 November 1793 Delacroix enlisted as a naval volunteer. He became a first class ensign on 27 April 1794, and was discharged in 1796. On 8 January 1799 he enlisted as a second lieutenant in the 9th Chasseurs-a-Cheval Regiment. He participated in the campaign of the Army of Italy that year. General Joubert promoted him to Lieutenant on 13 August 1799 in recognition of his gallantry. On 3 January 1800 he was accepted as Lieutenant in the Chasseurs-a-Cheval Regiment of the Consular Guard. He fought with distinction at the Battle of Marengo (14 June 1800). On 26 October 1800 he was promoted to Captain.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

FedEx's shares traded at over $244 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$55.5 billion in October 2018. FedEx ranked No. 50 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. FedEx is organized into operating units, each of which has its own version of the wordmark designed in 1994 by Lindon Leader of Landor Associates, of San Francisco. The \"Fed\" is always purple and the \"Ex\" is in a different color for each division and platinum for the overall corporation use. The original FedEx logo had the \"Ex\" in orange; it is now used as the FedEx Express wordmark. The FedEx wordmark is notable for containing a subliminal right-pointing arrow in the negative space between the \"E\" and the \"X\", which was achieved by designing a proprietary font, based on Univers and Futura, to emphasize the arrow shape. In August 2016, FedEx announced that all operating units will switch over to the purple and orange color logo over the next 5 years. FedEx SameDay City allows a between: Standard, providing pickup by noon and delivery by the end of the day, or Priority, providing delivery within 2 hours. FedEx SameDay City is currently expanding in all major cities across the country and is planning on becoming its own operating unit in the next five years.\n\n[2] FedEx Air &amp; Ground NFL Players of the Week: Every week during the NFL season, six finalists are chosen for the FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week award, 3 nominated as the FedEx Air player (a quarterback) and 3 nominated as the FedEx Ground player (a running back), online on NFL.com. At the end of the season, fans nominate from 3 finalists of each category the FedEx Air & Ground Players of the Year.\n\n[3] Ford Flex: At its 2009 introduction, the Flex was launched with three trim levels. As with other Ford cars, there was an \"SE\" base model, mid-level \"SEL\", and top-trim \"Limited\". Flexes were available in six or seven-passenger seating configurations, (7-passenger models have a bench seat for the second row). As part of the roof design, Ford offered three colors for the roof paint: black, white/cream, and body-color.\n\n[4] FedEx Ground: FedEx purchased the parcel consolidator Parcel Direct in September 2004 from Quad Graphics. This FedEx Ground subsidiary was re-branded as FedEx SmartPost in October 2004. FedEx SmartPost uses FedEx for the long distance transportation and uses the US Postal Service for final delivery to residences.\n\n[5] FedEx Ground: In 1997, Fred Smith, founder of FedEx, contacted Dan Sullivan, co-founder of RPS and now president of Caliber Systems, Inc., about merging the two companies. In 2000, FedEx merged the Caliber System, Inc. operating companies into the FedEx organization with Robert's Express becoming FedEx Custom Critical and RPS becoming FedEx Ground. Viking Freight, which initially operated under its original name, was re-branded FedEx Freight in 2001.\n\n[6] ORM-D: Both UPS Ground and FedEx Ground do not require a hazardous shipping contract to ship ORM-D packages except to Alaska and Hawaii. FedEx Ground does not transport ORM-D packages to Alaska or Hawaii. The United States Postal Service will accept ORM-D packages only for materials intended for domestic surface transportation. Its use is prohibited in international mail.. As of Jan 1, 2014, FedEx Ground will no longer accept shipments labeled as ORM-D, Consumer Commodity, however these same materials can still be shipped using a different label. Per DOT regulations, FedEx Ground Limited Quantity packages can be shipped with a Hazardous Shipping Paper (OP-900) and Hazardous Material Certification OP-950), or without shipping papers by affixing the specific Limited Quantity Diamond Label to the package. .\n\n[7] FedEx: In the 1990s, FedEx Ground planned, but later abandoned, a joint service with British Airways to have BA fly a Concorde supersonic jet airliner to Shannon, Ireland with FedEx packages on board, and then FedEx would have flown the packages subsonically to their delivery points in Europe. Ron Ponder, a vice president at the time, was in charge of this proposed venture.  In January 2000, FDX Corporation changed its name to FedEx Corporation and re-branded all of its subsidiaries. Federal Express became FedEx Express, RPS became FedEx Ground, Roberts Express became FedEx Custom Critical, and Caliber Logistics and Caliber Technology were combined to comprise FedEx Global Logistics. A new subsidiary, called FedEx Corporate Services, was formed to centralize the sales, marketing, and customer service for all of the subsidiaries. In February 2000, FedEx acquired Tower Group International, an international logistics company. FedEx also acquired WorldTariff, a customs duty and tax information company; TowerGroup and WorldTariff were re-branded to form FedEx Trade Networks.\n\n[8] FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground now provides 1-5 day delivery of small packages to all 50 states, plus Canada. Ground also delivered to Puerto Rico, but this service was discontinued in 2009. The subsidiary also offers a specialty service known as FedEx Home Delivery which, coupled with Ground, serves all home addresses in the United States.\n\n[9] FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground is a package shipping company that is a subsidiary of the FedEx Corporation. It is headquartered in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Originally conceived as a lower cost competitor to UPS, Roadway Package System (RPS) was created to take advantage of new barcode, material handling and computer technologies.\n\n[10] Enterprise (NX-01): Drexler also wanted the bussard collectors at the front of the warp nacelles to be orange like \"The Original Series\", but this was overruled by producers once more, who wanted them red also like the later series. Drexler thought that this was because Rick Berman wasn't fond of bright colors, and so \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" was filmed in greys and dark blues. The rear ends of the nacelles were influenced by \"Enterprise\" from \"The Original Series\", with the spheres that appeared on the 1960s version split in two for the NX-01. Direct elements from \"The Original Series\" that did make it on to the NX-01 were the impulse engine cones and the lower sensor dome. The most prominent element from the first television \"Enterprise\" was the deflector dish. For the NX-01, it was compressed on the vertical axis and placed at the front of the saucer. The process of Drexler getting his designs approved by the producers was later described as \"a long hard battle\" by production illustrator and creator of \"Enterprise\"-E, John Eaves.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model of NHEJ1 deficiency, it was shown that NHEJ1 has an important role in promoting survival of the primitive hematopoietic progenitors. These NHEJ1 deficient cells possess a weak NHEJ1-mediated repair capacity that is apparently incapable of coping with DNA damages induced by physiological stress, normal metabolism, and ionizing radiation.\n\n[2] Hematopoietic stem cell: Deficiency of NHEJ factor 1 in mice leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells as indicated by several lines of evidence including evidence that long-term repopulation is defective and worsens over time. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model of NHEJ1 deficiency, it was shown that NHEJ1 has an important role in promoting survival of the primitive hematopoietic progenitors. These NHEJ1 deficient cells possess a weak NHEJ1-mediated repair capacity that is apparently incapable of coping with DNA damages induced by physiological stress, normal metabolism, and ionizing radiation.\n\n[3] Non-homologous end-joining factor 1: Non-homologous end-joining factor 1 (NHEJ1), also known as Cernunnos or XRCC4-like factor (XLF), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the NHEJ1 gene. XLF was originally discovered as the protein mutated in five patients with growth retardation, microcephaly, and immunodeficiency. The protein is required for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA repair. Patients with XLF mutations also have immunodeficiency due to a defect in V(D)J recombination, which uses NHEJ to generate diversity in the antibody repertoire of the immune system. XLF interacts with DNA ligase IV and XRCC4 and is thought to be involved in the end-bridging or ligation steps of NHEJ. The yeast (\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\") homolog of XLF is Nej1.\n\n[4] Hematopoietic stem cell: DNA strand breaks accumulate in long term HSCs during aging. This accumulation is associated with a broad attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways that depends on HSC quiescence. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as \"non-homologous\" because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template. The NHEJ pathway depends on several proteins including ligase 4, DNA polymerase mu and NHEJ factor 1 (NHEJ1, also known as Cernunnos or XLF).\n\n[5] Mycobacterium smegmatis: The NHEJ pathway for repairing double-strand breaks involves the rejoining of the broken ends. It does not depend on a second homologous chromosome. This pathway requires the Ku protein and a specialized poly-functional ATP-dependent DNA ligase (ligase D). NHEJ is efficient but inaccurate. Sealing of blunt DNA ends within a functional gene sequence occurs with a mutation frequency of about 50%. NHEJ is the preferred pathway during stationary phase, and it protects \"M. smegmatis\" against the harmful effects of desiccation.\n\n[6] Homologous recombination: Double-strand breaks can be repaired through homologous recombination or through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is a DNA repair mechanism which, unlike homologous recombination, does not require a long homologous sequence to guide repair. Whether homologous recombination or NHEJ is used to repair double-strand breaks is largely determined by the phase of cell cycle. Homologous recombination repairs DNA before the cell enters mitosis (M phase). It occurs during and shortly after DNA replication, in the S and G phases of the cell cycle, when sister chromatids are more easily available. Compared to homologous chromosomes, which are similar to another chromosome but often have different alleles, sister chromatids are an ideal template for homologous recombination because they are an identical copy of a given chromosome. In contrast to homologous recombination, NHEJ is predominant in the G phase of the cell cycle, when the cell is growing but not yet ready to divide. It occurs less frequently after the G phase, but maintains at least some activity throughout the cell cycle. The mechanisms that regulate homologous recombination and NHEJ throughout the cell cycle vary widely between species.\n\n[7] Agrin: The requirement for Agrin and MuSK in the formation of the NMJ was demonstrated primarily by knockout mouse studies. In mice that are deficient for either protein, the neuromuscular junction does not form. Many other proteins also comprise the NMJ, and are required to maintain its integrity. For example, MuSK also binds a protein called \"dishevelled\" (Dvl), which is in the Wnt signalling pathway. Dvl is additionally required for MuSK-mediated clustering of AChRs, since inhibition of Dvl blocks clustering.\n\n[8] Cernunnos deficiency: In terms of genetics the condition, Cernunnos deficiency is due to a mutation in the NHEJ1 gene, it has a cytogenetic location of 2q35, while its molecular location is 219,075,324 to 219,160,865\n\n[9] NEDD8: Neddylation also has a role in repair of double-strand breaks. Non-homologous end joining(NHEJ) is a DNA repair pathway frequently used to repair DNA double-strand breaks. The first step in this pathway depends on the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer that forms a highly stable ring structure encircling DNA ends. But the Ku heterodimer needs to be removed when NHEJ is completed, or it blocks transcription or replication. The Ku heterodimer is ubiquitylated in a DNA-damage and neddylation-dependent manner to promote the release of Ku and other NHEJ factors from the site of repair after the process is completed.\n\n[10] Cernunnos deficiency: Cernunnos deficiency is a form of combined immunodeficiency characterized by microcephaly, due to mutations in the NHEJ1 gene, it is inherited via autosomal recessive manner Management for this condition is antiviral prophylaxis and antibiotic treatment\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Its flesh is fine texture, juicy and crisp. Early in the season, Golden Russets exhibit an attractive, though extreme, tartness that makes them an excellent eating apple; if left to ripen long, their flavor grows quite sweet, but their flesh deteriorates and becomes mealy and soft. Despite its positive characteristics, the apple does not market well as an eating variety because of its russet. Harvested at late season, the Golden Russet keeps very well in storage. It keeps its shape in cooking, though its texture—regardless of when it was harvested—will turn noticeably mealy when baked. The Golden Russet's tree can tolerate some cold.\n\n[2] Roxbury Russet: The Roxbury Russet apple was one of the varieties grown by Major General Israel Putnam on his farm in Pomfret, Connecticut. His grandson, also named Israel Putnam, introduced this variety to the Ohio Valley in 1796. The grandson received a total of 23 varieties of apple from Connecticut in that year, most of which probably came from his grandfather's farm. The Putnam Russet (Roxbury Russet) was considered to be the best and most profitable winter apple of all the varieties received, and was regarded as a good \"keeper\" (an important characteristic in an age before refrigeration). And not only a good keeper, but if we are to believe Nathaniel Hawthorne, one that improves with age. For in The House of the Seven Gables, Uncle Venner remarks, “But I suppose I am like a Roxbury russet, – a great deal the better, the longer I can be kept.”The historic Shirley-Eustis House museum in Roxbury, Massachusetts, was planted in 1993 with five 'Roxbury Russet' apple trees.\n\n[3] Roxbury Russet: It is a greyish-green russet apple known for its good winter-keeping qualities, as well as its suitability for making cider and juice. It is not widely grown or commercially available due to general commercial disfavor for russet varieties; the dull and heavily marked face makes it hard to sell now. The yellow-green flesh is firm and coarse-textured, suited for eating fresh and cooking. It is available from growers who specialize in heirloom plants. It ripens from September to October, and so is commonly available in autumn in farmers markets in the Northeast. Each apple contains 12.87% sugar that ferments to 6% alcohol in hard cider production.\n\n[4] Golden Russet: Golden Russet is an old American cultivar of domesticated apple which is excellent for fresh eating as well as for apple cider production. It is a russet apple and is therefore especially used as a cider apple. It is sometimes known as 'English Golden Russet', and has frequently been confused with 'English Russet'.\n\n[5] Starburst (confectionery): The brand name \"Opal Fruits\" was phased out in the UK, followed by Ireland in 1998 in order to standardize the product in a globalised marketplace. In 2008, the supermarket chain Asda revived the original Opal Fruits in the UK for a period of 12 weeks starting 10 May 2008. On 6 October 2008 Mars acquired Wrigley, and it transferred Mars' non-chocolate candy brands, including Starburst, to the Wrigley subsidiary. The original flavours are now branded \"Original Fruits\", and Starburst now comes in several assortments: Limited Edition Retro Fruits, Tropical, Baja California, Sour, Strawberry Mix, Berries & Creme, Very Berry and Fruity Slushies. Among the additional flavors are Strawberry Lemonade Chill, Citrus Slush, Cherry Splash, Blue Raspberry Rush Kiwi, Banana, Plum, Blueberry, Passion Fruit, Blackberry, Raspberry, Strawberry-Banana, Mango, Melon, Tropical Punch, Green Apple, Blue Raspberry, Watermelon, Mixed Berries & Cream, Peaches & Cream, Orange Cream, and Strawberry & Cream. Europe and the United States also has the \"Sour\" assortment, which includes Apple, Cherry, Pineapple and Raspberry, as well as Strawberry Mix. As of early 2010 it was decided that Strawberry was the most popular flavor in the United Kingdom. Lime is also very popular within this demand.\n\n[6] Brown Snout: It is a late-flowering variety, classed as a \"bittersweet\" apple, with relatively high tannins and low levels of malic acid. It makes a medium-sized tree with a stiffly upright habit. The fruit are small and green, with patches of russeting, and a large patch of russeting at the calyx end, giving the variety its name.\n\n[7] Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus): Theophrastus reports that cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, purslane and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but wait for the right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts out a series of flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.\n\n[8] Orange (fruit): The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has established the following grades for Florida oranges, which primarily apply to oranges sold as fresh fruit: US Fancy, US No. 1 Bright, US No. 1, US No. 1 Golden, US No. 1 Bronze, US No. 1 Russet, US No. 2 Bright, US No. 2, US No. 2 Russet, and US No. 3. The general characteristics graded are color (both hue and uniformity), firmness, maturity, varietal characteristics, texture, and shape. \"Fancy\", the highest grade, requires the highest grade of color and an absence of blemishes, while the terms \"Bright\", \"Golden\", \"Bronze\", and \"Russet\" concern solely discoloration.\n\n[9] Blackcurrant: Varieties producing green fruit, less strongly-flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants, are cultivated in Finland, where they are called \"greencurrants\" (\"viherherukka\"). In Poland, the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance, fruit quality, adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting. Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry (\"Ribes grossularia\"), the red currant (\"Ribes rubrum\") and the flowering currant (\"Ribes sanguineum\"). The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to \"R. nigrum\". Cultivars produced include 'Tisel' and 'Tiben' in 2000 and 'Ores', 'Ruben' and 'Tines' in 2005. Further cultivars 'Polares' and 'Tihope' are being tested. Since 1991, New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development, as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop. Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield, large fruit size, consistency of cropping and upright habit.\n\n[10] Ribes aureum: The plant blooms in spring with racemes of conspicuous golden yellow flowers, often with a pronounced, spicy fragrance similar to that of cloves or vanilla. Flowers may also be shades of cream to reddish, and are borne in clusters of up to 15. The shrub produces berries about 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) in diameter from an early age. Ripe fruits, amber yellow to black, are edible raw, but very tart, and are usually cooked with sugar. The flowers are also edible.\"Ribes aureum\" is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant, in traditional, native plant, drought tolerant, and wildlife gardens, and natural landscaping projects. Unlike some other species of currants, \"Ribes aureum\" is in the remarkably drought-tolerant group of \"Ribes\". Named cultivars have been introduced also.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The symbol was originally designed in 1912 by de Coubertin. He appears to have intended the rings to represent the five continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and America. According to Coubertin, the colours of the rings together with the white of the background included the colours composing every competing nation's flag at the time. Upon its initial introduction, Coubertin stated the following in the August 1912 edition of \"Olympique\":\n\n[2] Olympic Games: The Olympic Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Olympic Charter. The Olympic symbol, better known as the Olympic rings, consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents (Africa, America, Asia, Australia and Europe). The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms the Olympic flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.\n\n[3] Olympic symbols: The current view of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is that the symbol \"reinforces the idea\" that the Olympic Movement is international and welcomes all countries of the world to join. As can be read in the Olympic Charter, the Olympic symbol represents the union of the \"five continents\" of the world and the meeting of athletes from throughout the world at the Olympic Games. However, no continent is represented by any specific ring. Prior to 1951, the official handbook stated that each colour corresponded to a particular continent: blue for Europe, yellow for Asia, black for Africa, green for Australia and Oceania, and red for the Americas; this was removed because there was no evidence that Coubertin had intended it (the quotation above was probably an afterthought). Nevertheless, the logo of the Association of National Olympic Committees places the logo of each of its five continental associations inside the ring of the corresponding colour.\n\n[4] Olympic Airlines: Olympic Airlines had the following codeshare agreements:The first logo of the airline was a white eagle, bearing a resemblance to a propeller, featuring five rings and the name \"Olympic\". Just two years after the first flight, Onassis asked his associates to design a new logo and the coloured rings were created. Onassis wanted to copy the five coloured rings of the Olympic emblem, but the International Olympic Committee claimed the rights to the emblem, so a new, six ring logo was introduced. The first five rings stand for the five continents, while the sixth stands for Greece. Colours used were yellow, red, blue and white.\n\n[5] 2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony: Citius, altius, fortiusThe Sparks of Passion reentered the stadium in this segment where the largest and tallest Olympic Rings for the Opening Ceremonies would be created. Acrobats could be seen maneuvering on three ring shaped frames floating up and down along four lattice columns on the opposite end of the stadium to the stage and the mosh pit. Dancers in red unitards below gyrated to pulsing beats as the theme of passion returned for this segment of the program. While the acrobats descended to the ground, two additional ring shaped frames were raised. The five circular frames were flipped vertically revealing the five Olympic Rings shimmering in light. The rings were then illuminated in the Olympic colours and the structure was lit up in fireworks. The black ring in the centre of the symbol was substituted with white since it is impossible to produce black light.The national teams then entered underneath the five-ring structure in the traditional Parade of Nations. As with all Olympic games, the first team to emerge was Greece, since it was the birthplace of the games, and the host nation Italy entered last. The rest of the nations entered following the alphabetical order according to the spelling of the country in Italian, the language of the host country, as is tradition. Greece entering first and Italy entering last also symbolized the countries that hosted the two most recent Olympics: Greece hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics games held in Athens, and Italy hosted these.\n\n[6] 1988 Summer Paralympics: The Seoul Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) designed the first Paralympic Symbol which was used from 1988–1994. The Five 'teardrops' (resembling the halves of the \"taeguk\" pattern, also found in the Korean flag) in the 'W' configuration and colours of the Olympic rings represented the five oceans and the five continents. This symbol was eventually changed in 1994, as it was considered to be too close to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) 5-ring emblem. The 1988 Seoul Paralympic Games is considered as the genesis of the Modern Paralympic Games.\n\n[7] Australia at the 1988 Summer Paralympics: The Seoul Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) designed the first Paralympic Symbol which was used from 1988–1994. The Five 'teardrops' in the 'W' configuration and colours of the Olympic rings represented the five oceans and the five continents. This symbol was eventually changed in 1994, as it was considered to be too close to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) 5-ring emblem. The 1988 Seoul Paralympic Games is considered as the genesis of the Modern Paralympic Games.\n\n[8] Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques: In 1891 when the USFSA organised its first athletics championship, Henri Didon, as honorary president, announced that the organisation's motto would be \"Citius, Altius, Fortius\" (Faster, Higher, Stronger). In 1924 this motto would be adopted by the Olympic movement. The Olympic symbol of five interlinking rings was also based on a design used by the USFSA. Teams representing the organisation wore a uniform based on the colours of the flag of France. This included a white shirt with two interlinking rings, one red and one blue. The two rings represented the two groups that had merged to form the USFSA while the Olympic version represented five continents. Pierre de Coubertin also hoped that the USFSA would be responsible for organising the 1900 Paris Olympics. However a dispute, which saw de Coubertin resign as USFSA secretary general in April 1899, meant this never happened\n\n[9] Olympic Order: The insignia of the Olympic Order is in the form of a \"collar\" (or chain), in Gold, Silver or Bronze according to grade; the front of the chain depicts the five rings of the Olympic Movement, flanked on either side by \"kotinos\" emblem (olive wreath). A lapel badge, in the form of the five rings in Gold, Silver and Bronze according to grade, is presented to recipients to wear as appropriate. Nadia Comăneci is the only athlete to be awarded the Olympic Order twice (1984, 2004). She is also the youngest recipient of Olympic Order since 1984 when she was only 23 years old at the time of award.\n\n[10] 2008 Summer Olympics marketing: The official 2008 Olympic Mascots are the five Fuwa (, literally \"good luck dolls\"). The Fuwa consist of five members that incorporate fish, giant panda, fire, Tibetan antelope, and swallow designs. The Fuwa each have as their primary color one of the colors of the five Olympic Rings that stand for the five continents. The five Fuwa are named Beibei, Jingjing, Huanhuan, Yingying, and Nini. When the first syllable of each of the five names are said together, the result is the phrase (Běijīng huānyíng nĭ) which means \"\"Beijing welcomes you\"\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If a song has vocals, part of the vocals may be removed for voice-overs or dialogue, while the instrumental track is left intact. Some notable examples are the songs: \"Complicated\", \"Sk8er Boi\", \"I'm With You\", and \"Losing Grip\" from the Japanese special bonus edition of the 2002 album \"Let Go\" by Avril Lavigne, or \"Ready to Uff\" from the 2006 EP \"Pop the Glock/Ready to Uff\", and \"Brand New Car\" from the 2007 single \"F1rst Love\", both by Uffie, all used as TV tracks.\n\n[2] Samba TV: Samba TV tracks what appears on the users' TV by reading pixels; this capability extends to streaming programs and even video games played on the television. Samba TV benefits advertisers by identifying other devices in the home that share the TV’s internet connection, for the purposes of delivering targeted advertising.\n\n[3] Google Current: Google Current was a brief, once every half hour, television program on the channel Current TV. Selected episodes were also available on the Internet. The series tracked not necessarily what the news was, but what people were searching for on Google.\n\n[4] Album: Material (music or sounds) is stored on an album in sections termed tracks, normally 11 or 12 tracks. A music track (often simply referred to as a track) is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks; the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings a track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On a compact disc the track number is indexed so that a player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content.\n\n[5] Wonder What's Next: The album's first single, \"The Red,\" was released far in advance in July 2002. It met with significant radio airplay and charted highly on both Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks. Its music video also gained significant TV rotation. In October, the album debuted at No. 14 on the \"Billboard\" 200. A follow-up single, \"Send the Pain Below\" attained even greater success than its predecessor in February 2003 by reaching No. 1 on both Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks. Both \"The Red\" and \"Send the Pain Below\" have since become concert staples. To round off promotion of \"Wonder What's Next\", \"Closure\" was released as the third and final single far later in December to substantial success.\n\n[6] Perry Mason (TV series): Ozzy Osbourne's 1995 album, \"Ozzmosis\", opens with a track titled \"Perry Mason\". Released as a single, the song was the first to integrate the music of \"Perry Mason\" into what one reviewer described as a \"bruising rocker … complete with an ominous excerpt from the classic TV show theme\".\n\n[7] What About Us (The Saturdays song): \"What About Us\" was written and produced by Ollie Jacobs and acts as The Saturdays first single to be released in North America where it could appear on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100. In America its release coincided with their TV show, \"Chasing the Saturdays\". The track is the band's fourteenth single to be released in the United Kingdom and Ireland and the track is a dance-pop song. Before the release of the song, Mollie King said that the band were excited to share the track as they had the song \"for months\" She said: \"I can't wait for everyone to hear it and to get to perform it. I'm just so excited about this one, I think it's going down really well.\" The band said they didn't want to change their type of music just for the American public and would stick to their roots and the genre they enjoyed to perform. King spoke: \"We've always made a point that we don't want to change to go to America. We wanted to go over as we are and if they like us, they like us and if they don't, they don't!\" King said that the track is reggae pop music, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really \"dancey\" and \"upbeat\", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she \"did not know\" what the song was exactly about. \"To be honest I was trying to figure out the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy.\" She said she \"thinks\" that 'What About Us' part means \"me and you getting\n\n[8] The Flying Lizards (album): all tracks by David Cunningham except as noted 11. \"All Guitars\" - 2:41 (\"Sunmmertime Blues\" single B-side) 12. \"Tube\" - 5:09 (instrumental remix of \"TV\" - B side of \"TV\" single) 13. \"Money (That's What I Want)\" - 2:32 (single edit)\n\n[9] Wild track: Wild track, also known as wild sound and wild lines, is an audio recording intended to be synchronized with film or video but recorded separately. Generally, the term \"wild track\" refers to sound recorded on location, such as sound effects gathered when the cameras were not rolling or extra takes of lines performed for audio only.Note that wild track is considered something of a \"cheapie\" solution to these problems, and a big-budget production is more likely to use studio-recorded sound in these situations, as its quality is more controllable and predictable than wild track.\n\n[10] Nicole Willis: The title track of the album \"Keep Reachin' Up\" was chosen by US President Barack Obama, as one of many songs on his Re-Election Campaign Spotify Playlist, in February 2012. The track \"If This Ain't Love(Don't Know What Is)\" was placed in the USA TV channel ABC's show \"Brothers & Sisters\" in season 2, episode 1 in 2007. The track \"No One's Gonna Love You\" was placed in Showtime's \"Ray Donovan\" in season 1, episode 3 in 2013.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is synthesized and marketed by Molecular Probes/Invitrogen (a division of Life Technologies, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific) of Eugene, Oregon, United States. In its free form, RiboGreen exhibits little fluorescence and possesses a negligible absorbance signature. When bound to nucleic acids, the dye fluoresces with an intensity that, according to the manufacturer, is several orders of magnitude greater than the unbound form. The fluorescence can be detected by a sensor and the nucleic acid can be quantified. The presence of protein contaminants in the sample of nucleic acids to be tested does not make significant contributions to the absorbance, and thus allows for the addition of deoxyribonucleases to the protocol in order to degrade DNA, in the instances where one is only interested in detecting or quantifying RNA.\n\n[2] Rigel (comics): In the monographic \" Rigel-Anedonìa \" released in 2014 for [[Panini Comics]], , the vampire manages to free herself from her \"human side\" after ten years of \"torpor\". The setting and the supporting characters will remain the same (as far as in this monographic see only Sortilegio), and the \"world\" of the character remains the same as \"Rigel-Interlunium\". It is the nature of the character itself that changes, without anything that has been narrated in \"Interlunium\" being denied or canceled, including supporting characters and settings. In fact, \"Rigel-Anedonìa\" is a passage book between the old and the new narrative arc.\n\n[3] Ronin Arts: Ronin Arts has produced material for other licensed systems, publishing the \"Runic Fantasy\" series for Mongoose Publishing's \"RuneQuest\" (2006-2007), the \"First Edition Fantasy\" series for \"AD&D\" retroclone, \"OSRIC\" (2006-2007), and supplements for \"Mutants & Masterminds\" (2003-2008). Hammes and Reed wrote \"4c System\" (2007), the retroclone to TSR's \"Marvel Super Heroes\" system, which then attracted supplements by Hazard Studio, Highmoon Games, Seraphim Guard and others. Ronin Arts also published one of the few early Freeport licenses, \"Treasures of Freeport\" (2004) and thereafter produced a handful of \"True20\" supplements (2005-2006) and a long series of \"Mutants & Masterminds\" Archetype books (2006-2007) which were sold directly by Green Ronin. In 2006 Reed was able to successfully sell an extended series of PDFs called ePublishing 101 which recounted how to make PDF production work. By 2007, the PDF market had cooled considerably and Reed decided to go back to work at Steve Jackson Games, and in 2008 he became Chief Operating Officer of the company.\n\n[4] Radial-G: Racing Revolved: Radial-G was first released through an early access launch 11 December 2014 and throughout 2015 there were various additions to the game with the first full version being released on March 28, 2016. Oculus Rift DK1 and DK2 was supported from the first early access release. The third-person camera view, for non-VR users, and two new tracks were added on 2 March 2015. On 2 April 2015, two new race tracks were added along with support for three levels of ship speed class, and steam leaderboards, stats and achievements. On 8 April 2015, the quick race and lap attack features were added. Single-player mode was implemented on 14 July 2015. The game officially released on 28 March 2016 as a Day One Launch Title for Oculus Rift. HTC Vive, Steam VR, Open VR and Razer OSVR support was added on 5 April 2016. The twenty official twenty music tracks were released on 30 July 2016. Combat gameplay modes as well as three new ships and additional OSVR support were added on 23 September 2016.\n\n[5] David Morgan-Mar: Established at the end of 2002 and running until late in 2011, \"Irregular Webcomic!\" was a photo-comic that consisted mostly of photographs of Lego characters and sets with speech balloons added above them (although there were some strips named Me - with Morgan-Mar in them - as well as the fantasy and space themes - which were photographs of painted miniatures) and had several (usually) distinct casts of characters (called \"themes\") with many different kinds of jokes and story arcs. Since completing its run as a webcomic, Morgan-Mar uses the site for a weekly blog, as something of a carry-over from the occasionally-long notes to the former webcomic. After a successful Patreon fundraiser, Morgan-Mar resumed the webcomic on April 26, 2015; the strip updates on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, with reruns appearing on other days.\n\n[6] Rogue &amp; Gambit: The first issue was released on January 3, 2018. Comic shops ordered about 38,600 copies. By issue 3, orders had fallen to about 18,500. In a pre-release interview, Thompson hoped sales and fan response would be strong enough to warrant an ongoing series starring the characters. A softcover collection of the series is scheduled for release in June 2018 with the subtitle \"Ring of Fire\".\n\n[7] Roblox: In April 2016, \"Roblox\" launched \"Roblox VR\" for Oculus Rift. At the time of release, more than ten million games were available in 3D. Around the same time period, the safe chat feature was removed and replaced by a system based on a whitelist with a set of acceptable words for users under 13 years old and on a blacklist for other users. In June, the company launched a version compatible with Windows 10. While the game platform has had a PC presence since 2004 with its web version, this is the first time it was upgraded with a standalone launcher built for Windows.\n\n[8] Rage comic: Although used on numerous websites such as Reddit, Cheezburger, ESS.MX, Ragestache, and 9GAG, the source of the rage comic has largely been attributed to 4chan in mid-2007. The first rage comic was posted to the 4chan /b/random board in 2008. It was a simple 4-panel strip showing the author's anger about getting \"splashback\" while on the toilet, with the final panel featuring a zoomed-in face, known as Rage Guy, saying\" FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-\". It was quickly reposted and modified, with other users creating new scenarios and characters.\n\n[9] OB Rag: The OB Rag was revived twenty-six years later with paper editions published in Ocean Beach between 2001 and 2003 by members of the Ocean Beach Grassroots Organization (OBGO). The OB Rag has been online at OBRag.org since 2007.

Painter Rembrandt lived and worked in the house between 1639 and 1656. The 17th-century interior has been reconstructed. The collection contains Rembrandt's etchings and paintings of his contemporaries. The museum had in 2014.\n\n[2] Sint Antoniesbreestraat: In the early 17th century, the street was popular with immigrants and artists such as the painter Rembrandt, who lived there from 1631 to 1635, at the home of art dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh. (From 1639 to 1656 he lived in his own home, now the Rembrandt House Museum.) Other painters who lived in the street, near the Guild of Saint Luke in the former Sint Anthoniespoort, include Esaias Boursse, who lived next door to Rembrandt, Nicolaes Eliaszoon Pickenoy, Cornelis van der Voort, Roelant Savery, Pieter Lastman (in whose workshop Rembrandt served as apprentice), Adriaen van Nieulandt, Pieter Codde, Justus, Johannes Vingboons, their father David Vinckboons, Willem Kick. The burgomasters Geurt van Beuningen. and Joan Huydecoper grew up here.\n\n[3] Jan Theuns: Jan Theuns was fascinated by the work of Rembrandt, Rubens and van Dyck. He studied their paintings at different museums in Antwerp and Rotterdam, and The Hague and even the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. He mastered the technique, color and composition of the 17th century artists. He often imitated Rembrandt’s portraits with such a dexterity that earned him the nickname of “Breda’s Rembrandt.” These skills accidentally got him into trouble with the law in 1927 when Theuns was involved in a scandal. In 1909 Mr. Duynstee, an antique collector from Delft, bought in Breda for 10 guilders the painting of an old rabbi (similar to Rembrandt’s \"Portrait of Jacob Trip\" c. 1661, held by the National Gallery, London). Eighteen years later, Mr. Duynstee sold it for 70,000 guilders as a Rembrandt. The cleaning of the painting and later a technical investigation by authoritative Rembrandt scholars Dr. Abraham Bredius and Caspar Niehaus revealed that “The rabbi” was not an original despite its striking similarity to Rembrandt’s work and a mysterious forged signature now appearing in the painting. Jan Theuns alleged that he never sold the painting as a Rembrandt, that he sold it for a small amount of money, and that someone else added the forged signature to his work. Theuns never signed these early “Rembrandts” and only did so after the scandal. He was not a criminal master forger (this is an intentional malicious one) as his famous contemporary Han van Meegeren, just a mater copyist. Jan Theuns maintained his innocence until his death in 1961 but this affair followed him throughout his life and made him world-famous–especially post-war--- as\n\n[4] Willem de Poorter: According to Houbraken he painted a very good \"Queen of Sheba\", but he painted mostly still lifes.  His surviving paintings today are mainly small historical allegories and still lifes with metal objects. Though he has been considered in the past by (some) 19th century historians to have been a pupil of Rembrandt, he in fact lived and worked in Haarlem, not Amsterdam. He was registered as a painter in Haarlem in 1631 and in 1634 as a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke. The confusion about being a pupil of Rembrandt comes from an incorrect reading of Houbraken, who mentions him in the same paragraph along with two other painters; a painter by the last name of Van Terlee, and the much younger Willem Drost, who did live in Amsterdam as a young man, and was in fact a pupil of Rembrandt there.\n\n[5] Rembrandt: Rembrandt lived beyond his means, buying art (including bidding up his own work), prints (often used in his paintings) and rarities, which probably caused a court arrangement to avoid his bankruptcy in 1656, by selling most of his paintings and large collection of antiquities. The sale list survives and gives us a good insight into Rembrandt's collections, which, apart from Old Master paintings and drawings, included busts of the Roman Emperors, suits of Japanese armor among many objects from Asia, and collections of natural history and minerals. But the prices realized in the sales in 1657 and 1658 were disappointing. Rembrandt was forced to sell his house and his printing-press and move to more modest accommodation on the Rozengracht in 1660. The authorities and his creditors were generally accommodating to him, except for the Amsterdam painters' guild, which introduced a new rule that no one in Rembrandt's circumstances could trade as a painter. To get around this, Hendrickje and Titus set up a business as art dealers in 1660, with Rembrandt as an employee.\n\n[6] Philosopher in Meditation: In the second volume of its \"Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings\", which covers the years 1631-1634, the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) rejected the attribution to Rembrandt of the \"Philosopher in Meditation\". Until then, and except for the \"heretical\" John C. Van Dyke, this attribution had been unanimously accepted by experts and art historians. The RRP did not introduce any new objective or documentary evidence, but based its judgment on an assessment of Rembrandt's \"habits,\" an appraisal of the painting's style, and the difficulty of fitting it within Rembrandt's production in 1632 or the later 1630s. The RRP did not make any guesses as to who the author of this painting might have been, but relegated it to \"Rembrandt's immediate circle, or even his own workshop.\" This judgment was analyzed by Jean-Marie Clarke who pointed out, among other things, that the RRP may have had a special stake in rejecting this painting, as the following quote suggests: \"In the later part of the 18th century the painting enjoyed a great reputation in France as \"Le Philosophe en contemplation\", and it helped to determine the image of Rembrandt's art to an unwarranted extent.\" This disattribution was not accepted by the Louvre and other Rembrandt scholars, and the newly configured RRP has changed its stance since then. In the fifth volume of the \"Corpus\" (2011), which covers \"small history paintings,\" the painting is classified without further ado as a \"re-attribution\" by the current director of the RRP, Ernst van de Wetering. The painting was officially re-instated in vol. 6 of the \"Corpus\" under no. 86 with the title \"Interior with a window and a winding staircase\n\n[7] Rembrandt: In 1635, Rembrandt and Saskia moved into their own house, renting in fashionable Nieuwe Doelenstraat. In 1639 they moved to a prominent newly built house (now the Rembrandt House Museum) in the upscale 'Breestraat' (eng.: 'Broadway'), today known as Jodenbreestraat (Jodenbreestraat 4,1011 NK Amsterdam-now) in what was becoming the Jewish quarter; then a young upcoming neighborhood. The mortgage to finance the 13,000 guilder purchase would be a primary cause for later financial difficulties. Rembrandt should easily have been able to pay the house off with his large income, but it appears his spending always kept pace with his income, and he may have made some unsuccessful investments. It was there that Rembrandt frequently sought his Jewish neighbors to model for his Old Testament scenes. Although they were by now affluent, the couple suffered several personal setbacks; their son Rumbartus died two months after his birth in 1635 and their daughter Cornelia died at just three weeks of age in 1638. In 1640, they had a second daughter, also named Cornelia, who died after living barely over a month. Only their fourth child, Titus, who was born in 1641, survived into adulthood. Saskia died in 1642 soon after Titus's birth, probably from tuberculosis. Rembrandt's drawings of her on her sick and death bed are among his most moving works.\n\n[8] Jodenbreestraat: Rembrandt lived in this street from 1631 to 1635, at the home of art dealer Hendrick van Uylenburgh, and again from 1639 to 1656, in his own house, built in 1606 and standing today. It now houses the Rembrandthuis museum. The street was also popular with other artists, such as the painter Esaias Boursse, who lived next door to Rembrandt.\n\n[9] Rembrandt: Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was born on 15 July 1606 in Leiden, in the Dutch Republic, now the Netherlands. He was the ninth child born to Harmen Gerritszoon van Rijn and Neeltgen Willemsdochter van Zuijtbrouck. His family was quite well-to-do; his father was a miller and his mother was a baker's daughter. Religion is a central theme in Rembrandt's paintings and the religiously fraught period in which he lived makes his faith a matter of interest. His mother was Roman Catholic, and his father belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church. While his work reveals deep Christian faith, there is no evidence that Rembrandt formally belonged to any church, although he had five of his children christened in Dutch Reformed churches in Amsterdam: four in the Oude Kerk (Old Church) and one, Titus, in the Zuiderkerk (Southern Church).\n\n[10] The Polish Rider: The first western scholar to discuss the painting was Wilhelm von Bode who in his \"History of Dutch Painting\" (1883) stated that it was a Rembrandt dating from his \"late\" period, that is, 1654. Somewhat later, Abraham Bredius examined the picture quite closely and had no doubts that its author was Rembrandt. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Alfred von Wurzbach suggested that Rembrandt's student Aert de Gelder might have been the author, but his opinion was generally disregarded. Throughout most of the twentieth century, there was general agreement that the painting was indeed by Rembrandt and even Julius S. Held, who at one time questioned its Polish connection, never doubted Rembrandt's authorship. However, in 1984, Josua Bruyn, then a member of the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) tentatively suggested that certain characteristics of the work of Willem Drost, another student of Rembrandt, could be observed in the painting. Though the mysterious and somewhat solemn expression on the Rider's brilliantly painted face point to Rembrandt,\"The Polish Rider\" is unlike Rembrandt's other work in certain other ways. In particular, Rembrandt rarely worked on equestrian paintings, the only other known equestrian portrait in Rembrandt's work being the \"Portrait of Frederick Rihel\", 1663 (National Gallery, London).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

These books are usually not found in the Protestant Bible, but are sometimes included in a separate inter-testamental section called the \"Apocrypha\".In another sense, a \"Catholic Bible\" is a Bible published in accordance with the prescriptions of Catholic canon law, which states:\n\n[2] Protestant Bible: A Protestant Bible is a Christian Bible whose translation or revision was produced by Protestants. Such Bibles comprise 39 books of the Old Testament (according to the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon, known especially to non-Protestants as the protocanonical books) and the 27 books of the New Testament for a total of 66 books. This is often contrasted with the 73 books of the Catholic Bible, which includes seven deuterocanonical books as a part of the Old Testament. The division between protocanonical and deuterocanonical books is not accepted by all Protestants who simply view books as being canonical or not and therefore classify the seven Catholic deuterocanonical books as part of the Apocrypha.\n\n[3] Books of the Bible: Christian Bibles range from the 73 books of the Catholic Church canon, the 66 books of the canon of some denominations or the 80 books of the canon of other denominations of the Protestant Church, to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon. The first part of Christian Bibles is the Greek Old Testament, which contains, at minimum, the above 24 books of the Tanakh but divided into 39 books and ordered differently. The second part is the Greek New Testament, containing 27 books; the four Canonical gospels, Acts of the Apostles, 21 Epistles or letters and the Book of Revelation.\n\n[4] Bible: The Protestant Old Testament of today has a 39-book canon – the number of books (though not the content) varies from the Jewish Tanakh only because of a different method of division – while the Roman Catholic Church recognizes 46 books (51 books with some books combined into 46 books) as the canonical Old Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize 3 Maccabees, 1 Esdras, Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 in addition to the Catholic canon. Some include 2 Esdras. The Anglican Church also recognizes a longer canon. The term \"Hebrew Scriptures\" is often used as being synonymous with the Protestant Old Testament, since the surviving scriptures in Hebrew include only those books, while Catholics and Orthodox include additional texts that have not survived in Hebrew. Both Catholics and Protestants (as well as Greek Orthodox) have the same 27-book New Testament Canon.\n\n[5] Bible: A number of books which are part of the Peshitta or the Greek Septuagint but are not found in the Hebrew (Rabbinic) Bible (i.e., among the protocanonical books) are often referred to as deuterocanonical books by Roman Catholics referring to a later secondary (i.e., deutero) canon, that canon as fixed definitively by the Council of Trent 1545–1563. It includes 46 books for the Old Testament (45 if Jeremiah and Lamentations are counted as one) and 27 for the New.\n\n[6] Catholic theology: Christianity regards the Bible, a collection of canonical books in two parts (the Old Testament and the New Testament), as authoritative. It is believed by Christians to have been written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and therefore for many it is held to be the inerrant Word of God. Protestant Christians believe that the Bible contains all revealed truth necessary for salvation. This concept is known as Sola scriptura. The books that are considered canon in the Bible vary depending upon the denomination using or defining it. These variations are a reflection of the range of traditions and councils that have convened on the subject. The Bible always includes books of the Jewish scriptures, the Tanakh, and includes additional books and reorganizes them into two parts: the books of the Old Testament primarily sourced from the Tanakh (with some variations), and the 27 books of the New Testament containing books originally written primarily in Greek. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox canons include other books from the Septuagint Greek Jewish canon which Roman Catholics call Deuterocanonical. Protestants consider these books apocryphal. Some versions of the Christian Bible have a separate Apocrypha section for the books not considered canonical by the publisher.\n\n[7] Twelve Minor Prophets: In the Hebrew Bible, these works were counted as one book. The works are commonly studied together, and are consistently ordered in Jewish, Protestant and Catholic Bibles. In many Orthodox Christian Bibles they are ordered according to the Septuagint. The books are in rough chronological order, according to explicit statements within the books themselves. In the Roman Catholic Church, the twelve minor prophets are read in the Tridentine Breviary during the fourth and fifth weeks of November, which are the last two weeks of the liturgical year.\n\n[8] Museum of the Bible: However, the Catholic theologian Thomas L. McDonald, writing in the \"National Catholic Register\" praised the abundance of material dedicated to the history of the Bible with respect to Roman Catholicism: A blog article in \"The Economist\" criticized the Museum of the Bible for allegedly taking into consideration Protestant, Jewish and Roman Catholic views, but ignoring the views of Orthodox Christianity and not mentioning the \"impact of the Bible on Islam\" or taking into account the opinions of scholars who do not consider that the Bible contains a coherent story. On the contrary, Thomas L. McDonald stated that \"The Museum of the Bible is telling the story of the holy book in all of its complexity. One display details all the various canons of Scripture, from Jewish to Ethiopic, what books they include, how they came to be in that form, and how they're used.\"\n\n[9] Old Testament: The books that comprise the Old Testament canon, as well as their order and names, differ between Christian denominations. The Catholic canon comprises 46 books, and the canons of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches comprise up to 51 books and the most common Protestant canon comprises 39 books. The 39 books in common to all the Christian canons correspond to the 24 books of the Tanakh, with some differences of order, and there are some differences in text. The additional number reflects the splitting of several texts (Kings, Samuel and Chronicles, Ezra–Nehemiah and the minor prophets) into separate books in Christian bibles. The books which are part of a Christian Old Testament but which are not part of the Hebrew canon are sometimes described as deuterocanonical. In general, Protestant Bibles do not include the deuterocanonical books in their canon, but some versions of Anglican and Lutheran bibles place such books in a separate section called Apocrypha. These extra books are ultimately derived from the earlier Greek Septuagint collection of the Hebrew scriptures and are also Jewish in origin. Some are also contained in the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\n[10] Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition: A Catholic Bible differs in the number, order, and occasionally preferred emphasis than books typically found in Bibles used by Protestants. The Catholic Church declares: \"Easy access to Sacred Scripture should be provided for all the Christian faithful. That is why the Church from the very beginning accepted as her own that very ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament which is called the septuagint; and she has always given a place of honor to other Eastern translations and Latin ones especially the Latin translation known as the vulgate.\" Not all the books in the Septuagint are included among those that the Catholic Church considers to be part of the Old Testament. On the other hand, the early Eastern translation known as the Peshitta excluded five New Testament books that the Catholic Church declares to be canonical. Translations used by Protestants typically use the shorter Masoretic Text as their basis regarding the Old Testament. The Luther Bible included what he called the Apocrypha and changed the traditional order of some of the New Testament books.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The EEC, the more ambitious of the three, came to be known as the \"Common Market\". The UK first applied to join them in 1961, but this was vetoed by France. A later application was successful, and the UK joined in 1973; two years later, the first ever national referendum on continuing membership resulted in 67.2% approval. Political integration gained greater focus when the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union (EU) in 1993, which incorporated (and after the Treaty of Lisbon, succeeded) the European Communities.\n\n[2] European Union (Referendum) Act 2016 (Gibraltar): On 1 January 1973, Gibraltar along with the rest of the United Kingdom joined what was then known as the European Communities (EC), the main component of which was known as the European Economic Community (EEC), but all collectively known informally but commonly and generally in the United Kingdom as the \"Common Market\" which later became the European Union. Gibraltar's accession to the EC was determined in legislation as part of the UK's membership under the European Communities Act 1972. When the territory joined it was completely isolated from the rest of the EC as neighbouring Spain did not become an EC member until 1 January 1986, some thirteen years later. Gibraltar did not participate in the 1975 UK European Communities membership referendum even though the result directly impacted on its membership and didn't participate in any European Parliamentary Elections between 1979 and 1999 but in 2002 legislation was passed by the British Parliament which allowed Gibraltar to formally take part in the 2004 European Parliament election as part of the South West European Parliament constituency in all subsequent European elections. Following the surprise election victory by the Conservatives in May 2015 it was announced that Gibraltar would fully participate in the proposed referendum on continuing EU membership and was legislated for in the European Union Referendum Act 2015.\n\n[3] Denmark and the European Union: Denmark formally applied to join the predecessor of the EU, the European Economic Community on 10 August 1961, a day after the British applied. But the then French president Charles de Gaulle vetoed British membership and Denmark did not wish to join the EEC without the United Kingdom. After much negotiation, and following a change in the French Presidency, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom eventually joined the European Communities on 1 January 1973. Denmark and Ireland were so economically linked to the UK, that they considered it necessary to join the EEC if the UK did. The Danish population voted for membership with 63.3% in favour with a turnout of 90.1%. This was the first of several enlargements which became a major policy area of the Union. In 1982, Greenland voted to leave the Community after gaining home rule from Denmark.\n\n[4] Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities: The Accession of the United Kingdom to the European Communities (EC) – the collective term for the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC) – took effect on 1 January 1973. This followed ratification of the Accession treaty which was signed in Brussels on 22 January 1972 by the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath, who had pursued the UK's application to the EEC since the late 1950s. Denmark and Ireland also joined as part of the same expansion but Norway, who had signed the treaty, declined to ratify it and so it was amended to exclude that country. The ECSC and EEC would later be integrated into the European Union under the Maastricht and (subsequently) Lisbon treaties.\n\n[5] Enlargement of the European Union: \"For my part, I have no doubt at all that the discussions which we have had will prove of real and lasting benefit, not only to Britain and France, but to Europe as a whole.\" As part of the deal for British entry, France agreed to allow the EEC its own monetary resources. However France made that concession only as Britain's small agriculture sector would ensure that Britain would be a net contributor to the Common Agricultural Policy dominated EEC budget. Applying together with the UK, as on the previous occasions, were Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. These countries were so economically linked to the UK that they considered it necessary to join the EEC if the UK did. However the Norwegian government lost a national referendum on membership and hence did not accede with the others on 1 January 1973. Gibraltar joined the Community with the United Kingdom at this point, as can be seen in the long title of the UK European Communities Act 1972.\n\n[6] History of European Union–United Kingdom relations: The UK was not a signatory of the three original treaties that were incorporated into what was then the European Communities, including the most well known of these, the 1957 Treaty of Rome, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC). The UK's applications to join in 1963 and 1967 were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, who said that \"a number of aspects of Britain's economy, from working practices to agriculture\" had \"made Britain incompatible with Europe\" and that Britain harboured a \"deep-seated hostility\" to any pan-European project.\n\n[7] France–Germany relations: As a sequence of this, booming European economies, fired by Germany, led to the formation of the new customs union known as the European Economic Community (EEC). But it did not go well as the organization of Europe, because only the members of the coal and steel community 'ECSC' (\" the six\": Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany) joined the EEC. Seven of the remaining nations belonging to the Organization of European Economic Cooperation (OEEC) which administered the Marshall Plan, did not join the EEC but instead formed an alternative body, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). It was a free trade area as opposed to a customs union with common external tariffs and a political agenda, competing with the EEC as it was remarkably successful.\n\n[8] Free trade: In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951 which became the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union (EU) in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world.\n\n[9] European integration: In 1967, the Merger Treaty (or Brussels Treaty) combine the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC. They already shared a Parliamentary Assembly and Courts. Collectively they were known as the European Communities. In 1987, the Single European Act (SEA) was the first major revision of the Treaty of Rome that formally established the single European market and the European Political Cooperation. The Communities originally had independent personalities although they were increasingly integrated, and over the years were transformed into what is now called the European Union.\n\n[10] Walter Hallstein: Britain had at first been against the formation of the EEC, preferring a looser free trade area, and later proposed a larger free trade area that would include the EEC and other European countries. The German government, German industry, and – especially – the Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, wanted Britain to be part of an integrated Europe. Hallstein opposed the idea of a wider free trade area at this time, advocating first achieving a greater degree of integration among a smaller number of countries. Discussions on the possibility of a wider trade area, avoiding the tariff wall between the EEC and the EFTA countries, continued, but in the middle of preparations for the negotiations the French government, on instructions from de Gaulle, withdrew. This unilateral action by the French in November 1958 displeased the other EEC members and effectively ended the negotiations. German politicians like Erhard felt that Hallstein and his commission had not done enough to promote the wider free trade area. The six countries of the EEC had decided on a customs union: they agreed to remove tariffs between one another within a period of twelve years, and to erect a common tariff barrier between themselves and other countries. Seven of the excluded European countries (England, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, and Portugal) responded with an alternative free trade area, EFTA, which also removed tariff barriers between each other, but did not insist on a tariff barrier with other countries. The EFTA convention was signed in January 1960 and was to come into force in May 1960. On 3 March 1960, Hallstein announced a plan for accelerating the implementation of the common market, which commentators regarded as sabotaging hopes of a joint free trade area that included the EEC and EFTA. This invoked the displeasure, not only of the EFTA countries, but also of the Economics Ministry under Erhard.

The currency of the union (see next paragraph) was replaced by the modern Trinidad and Tobago dollar in 1964, two years after the nation's independence in 1962. The Trinidad and Tobago dollar was launched, and had become the sole currency by 1967.\n\n[2] Trinidad and Tobago dollar: From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of Trinidad and Tobago became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. In 1951, notes of the British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group, were introduced, replacing Trinidad and Tobago's own notes. In 1955, coins were introduced when the dollar was decimalized. In 1964, Trinidad and Tobago introduced its own dollar. Between 1964 and 1968 the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was utilized in Grenada as legal tender until that country rejoined the common currency arrangements of the East Caribbean dollar. The Trinidad and Tobago dollar and the Eastern Caribbean dollar were the last two currencies in the world to retain the old rating of one pound equals four dollars and eighty cents, as per the gold sovereign to the Pieces of eight. Both of these currencies ended this relationship within a few weeks of each other in 1976.\n\n[3] Tobagan dollar: The dollar was the currency of Tobago until 1814. The currency comprised various cut Spanish dollars and countermarked French colonial coins. The dollar was subdivided into 11 \"bits\", each of nine \"pence\". In 1814, sterling was established as the official currency of the island. Since 1905, dollars have once more circulated on Tobago, first the Trinidad and Tobago dollar, then the British West Indies dollar, before the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was reintroduced.\n\n[4] Trinidad and Tobago dollar: The dollar (currency code TTD) is the currency of Trinidad and Tobago. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively TT$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 cents. Its predecessor currencies are the Trinidadian dollar and the Tobagan dollar.\n\n[5] Trinidadian dollar: The dollar was the currency of Trinidad until 1814. The currency comprised various cut Spanish dollars and other Spanish colonial coins. Before 1811, the dollar was worth 8 shillings, each of 12 pence. After 1811, it was worth 9 shillings. In 1814, sterling was established as the official currency of the island. Since 1905, dollars have once more circulated on Trinidad, first the Trinidad and Tobago dollar, then the British West Indies dollar, before the Trinidad and Tobago dollar was reintroduced.\n\n[6] Trinidad and Tobago dollar: The history of currency in the former British colony of Trinidad and Tobago closely follows that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The first currency used was the Spanish dollar, also known as \"pieces of eight\", which began circulating in the 16th century. Proposals for establishing banks in the West Indies, targeted at landowners, were made in 1661 by the British government, and in 1690 by Sir Thomas Dalby. Despite this, and Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century.\n\n[7] Currencies of the British West Indies: The Eastern Caribbean group comprised Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands, and the Leeward Islands. These territories all used sterling coinage in conjunction with a mixture of sterling accounts and Spanish dollar accounts. The private banking sector tended to use Spanish dollar accounts at the fixed exchange rate of $1 = 4s 2d. The Eastern Caribbean group formed a monetary union with British Guiana in 1949 and the currency was known as the British West Indies dollar. Trinidad and Tobago left the arrangement in 1964. A new arrangement came about the following year and the currency was renamed the Eastern Caribbean dollar. British Guiana withdrew from this monetary union in 1966 and Barbados withdrew in 1972. (See the main articles at British West Indies dollar, Eastern Caribbean dollar, Trinidad and Tobago dollar, Guyanese dollar, and Barbados dollar.)\n\n[8] Trinidad and Tobago dollar: The abolition of slavery in the West Indies was the catalyst which led to the establishing of the first bank. The Colonial Bank was established on 1 June 1836, and opened its first branch in Trinidad in 1837 under the management of Anthony Cumming. Its initial mandate was to use Spanish and Mexican dollars as its official currency, and it was required to make all payments in those currencies, but incoming payments could be made in any currency, and the bank often found that it was short of dollars. The bank therefore lobbied the government, seeking permission to issue money in other currencies. This resulted in an imperial order-in-council in 1838, in which Trinidad and Tobago formally adopted the sterling currency, although the Spanish, Mexican and Colombian currencies were also declared legal tender.\n\n[9] Trinidad and Tobago dollar: On 14 December 1964, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago introduced notes for $1, $5, $10 & $20. New denominations in the form of $50 & $100 notes were issued on 6 June 1977, although the $50 note was not continued after a shipment was stolen prior to issue. The $50 note was taken out of its brief circulation. The reverses of the current notes feature the Central Bank Building of Trinidad & Tobago. The obverses have the coat of arms in the center, a national bird and a place in Trinidad, such as a market, petroleum refinery, etc. In 2002, new $1 & $20 notes were introduced. In 2003, new $1, $5, $10 & $100 were also introduced. The notes were only slightly changed; they now have more security features & darker colour. Recently, more security features have been added to the notes by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago. In 2012 the $50 note was reintroduced to commemorate Trinidad and Tobago's Golden Jubilee of Independence. On the front of the note is a Red-capped cardinal bird and the commemorative text around the center of the coat of arms. Two versions of this denomination were released, one without the commemorative text around the centre of the coat of arms (general circulation) and one with the commemorative text.\n\n[10] Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago: The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago is located in the Eric Williams Financial Complex. The complex consists of the central bank auditorium and two sky-scrapers, locally known as the Twin Towers. The first tower houses the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago and the second tower houses the Ministry of Finance. It was only the second Central Bank to be established in the English-speaking Caribbean, the first being the Bank of Jamaica which was established in 1960.The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago undertakes many functions in its day-to-day operations. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago was established by an Act of Parliament on December 12, 1964. In particular, the Bank's main responsibilities are to issue and redeem currency; maintain monetary and financial stability; act as banker to the government as well as the commercial banks and protect the external value of the Trinidad and Tobago Dollar (TT Dollar).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The beach is one of the two beaches which front the town of \"Albufeira\" with \"Praia do Túnel\" at the western end and \"Praia dos Pescadores\" lying to the eastern end of the towns seafront. The town and its beaches are located west by road of the regions capital of Faro. In the days before Albufeira had a harbour and mariner the \"Praia dos Pescadores\" was where all the local fishermen operated from and the beach scene would have been very different to the site you see today. Then the beach would have been full of brightly painted fishing boats pulled up on this beach when not at sea and much of the tourist activities took place on the \"Praia do Túnel\". Today the \"Praia dos Pescadores\" is now used for tourism and is a very busy beach especially in the summer season.\n\n[2] Praia do Túnel (Peneco): Praia do Túnel is a beach on the Atlantic south coast of the Algarve, in the town of Albufeira which is within the Municipality of Albufeira, Portugal. The beach is also known as \"Praia do Peneco\" and is one of the two beaches which front the town of \"Albufeira\" with \"Praia do Túnel\" at the western end and \"Praia dos Pescadores\" lying to the eastern end of the towns seafront. The town and its beaches are located west by road of the regions capital of Faro. The beach gets its name from a 20 meter long tunnel next to the tourist office in the middle of Albufeira which cuts through the cliffs linking the towns square to the beach. At the western end of the beach there is a promenade which ends at the cave known as the Xorino Grotto. According to 13th-century legend, the cave was used as shelter by the Moors after the Christian conquest of Albufeira. As well as the tunnel there are several other points of access to the beach including a lift, ramps and steps\n\n[3] Praia dos Pescadores (Albufeira): The beach is in length and is wide at low tide. The beach is divided by a protruding cliff from Praia do Túnel at the western end of the seafront. To the beaches eastern boundary is the Praia do Inatel and it is divided from that beach by a concrete pier which covers the outflow of the Ribeira de Albufeira (Albufeira River). There are also cliffs at the eastern end and to the back of the beach there is an amphitheatre of white houses of the district of Bairro dos Pescadores. The beach can also be accessed by an outdoor foot escalator from the Pau da Bandeira bluff located south of Bairro dos Pescadores down to the beach and Albufeira old town.\n\n[4] Praia dos Pescadores (Albufeira): Praia dos Pescadores is an easily accessed beach with its large hard surface square at beach level. There are two car park's near-by, one of which, is at beach level, a short distance along the Avenida 25 de Abril within the old town. The second car park is at the top of the cliffs at Bairro dos Pescadores and is accessed via the outdoor escalator. To the back of the western end of the beach there a variety of restaurants many of which specialise in the local fish and seafood. The beach has several licensed concessions with opportunities to hire parasols and sun loungers. There are also many organised beach and water sport concessions from volleyball to boat trips and Parasailing. The beach also has toilet and shower facilities. During the summer months the beach is patrolled by lifeguards. In recent years the beach has been the focal point for the new year celebrations in the town. A temporary concert stage is erected on the Largo 25 de Abril and concerts are held to celebrate the new year. In the past the celebration has seen international bands appearing such as British reggae/pop band UB40 in 2009. The celebrations cumulate with a firework display held just of the beach on boats and pontoons just of the shoreline.\n\n[5] Praia do Penedo: Praia do Penedo is a beach within the Municipality of Aljezur, in the Algarve, Portugal. The beach is on the western Seaboard in the north west of the Algarve. The beach is south west of the village of Aljezur, and is north west, by road, from the regions capital of Faro. The beach of Praia do Penedo is inside the Vicentine Coast Natural Park, an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\n[6] Praia do Norte: Praia do Norte is a civil parish of the municipality of Horta, located along the northern coast between Cedros and Capelo, on the Portuguese island of Faial, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 250, in an area of . It is the least populous parish on the island, reached along the \"Estrada Regional\" E.R.1-1ª regional roadway from the urban centre of Horta.\n\n[7] Praia das Conchas, São Tomé and Príncipe: Praia das Conchas is a settlement in the western part of the Lobata District on São Tomé Island in São Tomé and Príncipe. Its population is 174 (2012 census). Established as a plantation (\"roça\"), Praia das Conchas lies 2 km from the coast, 3 km west of Guadalupe. There is a smaller seaside settlement also called \"Praia das Conchas\", 3.5 km to the north.\n\n[8] Praia das Gatas: Praia das Gatas (Portuguese meaning \"beach of the cats\") is a sandy beach in the northeastern part of the island of Boa Vista in Cape Verde. The nearest village is Fundo das Figueiras, 5 km to the southwest. It forms a part of Northern Nature Park (\"Parque Natural do Norte\"). The small island Ilhéu dos Pássaros lies off the coast at the Praia das Gatas.\n\n[9] Praia (Santa Cruz da Graciosa): Praia (officially São Mateus da Praia) is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality of Santa Cruz da Graciosa, on the island of Graciosa, in the Azores. It still retains its former name locally, owing to the parish having once been the historical municipality of Praia. The population in 2011 was 836, in an area of 12.82 km².\n\n[10] Praia Harbor: Praia Harbor () is the port of the city of Praia in the southern part of the island of Santiago, Cape Verde. It is situated in a natural bay of the Atlantic Ocean. Since the latest modernization in 2014, it has 2 long quays, 3 shorter quays, a quay for fishing boats with fish processing installations, 2 container parks, 2 roll-on/roll-off ramps and a passenger terminal. The total length of the quays is 863 m, and the maximum depth is 13.5 m. The port of Praia played an important role in the colonization of Africa and South America by the Portuguese. With 817,845 metric tonnes of cargo and 85,518 passengers handled (2017), it is the second busiest port of Cape Verde, after Porto Grande (Mindelo).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The government consists of members of the Liberal-National Coalition, and Michael McCormack, the leader of the junior party in the Coalition, the National Party serves as Deputy Prime Minister. The prime ministership of Scott Morrison commenced on 24 August 2018, when he was sworn in by the Governor-General of Australia.\n\n[2] 2019 Australian federal election: On 24 August 2018, a petition with 43 signatures was brought to Turnbull calling for a party room meeting, and advice was obtained on Dutton's eligibility to sit in Parliament under section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. Turnbull stated he would not stand as a candidate for the leadership if the spill motion succeeded, which it did by 45 votes to 40. In the subsequent leadership ballot, Julie Bishop, Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison ran for party leader, and Morrison won the second ballot 45 votes to 40 over Dutton. Steven Ciobo, Greg Hunt and Josh Frydenberg contested the deputy leader position, which Frydenberg won. Later that evening, Scott Morrison was sworn in by the Governor-General as the 30th Prime Minister of Australia, while Frydenberg was sworn in as Treasurer in the Morrison Ministry.\n\n[3] 2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills: On the evening of 3 December 2018, Scott Morrison introduced a new threshold to trigger a Liberal leadership change in government, requiring two-thirds of the partyroom vote to trigger a spill motion. The change was introduced at an hour long evening special caucus meeting. Morrison said the changes, which were drafted with feedback from former prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott, would only apply to leaders who lead the party to victory at a federal election.\n\n[4] Angus Taylor (politician): Following the 21 August 2018 leadership spill in which Peter Dutton unsuccessfully challenged Malcolm Turnbull for leadership of the Liberal Party, Taylor was one of several frontbenchers to announce his resignation. Taylor wrote in a letter to Turnbull that he was resigning due to his support for Dutton, and expressing opposition to the more moderate policies espoused by Turnbull \"I have previously relayed to you my concerns about the direction of this Government, and my views on the policies that should characterise a traditional centre-right Liberal Party.\" After a second spill later in the week, Turnbull resigned as Prime Minister, with Scott Morrison being elected leader. Taylor was subsequently appointed as Minister for Energy, characterised by Morrison as \"Minister for reducing electricity prices\". His appointment prompted strong criticism from renewable energy advocates.\n\n[5] Morrison Government: The Liberal-National Coalition won government in the 2013 Election under Tony Abbott. The Abbott Government was brought to an end by means of an internal challenge by Malcolm Turnbull in February 2015. The Turnbull Government narrowly won the 2016 federal election, but was ended by the resignation of Turnbull in 2018. Morrison won the subsequent Liberal Party party room ballot for the leadership, and became Prime Minister of Australia. Josh Frydenberg replaced Julie Bishop as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Morrison as Treasurer. Turnbull quit Parliament leaving the Coalition in minority government following a by-election. Tensions remained as Turnbull lobbied for the removal of rivals. Morrison reformed Party rules to make it harder to remove elected Prime Ministers.\n\n[6] Scott Morrison: Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a leadership spill on 21 August 2018 in order to gauge the confidence of the Liberal Party in his leadership. He defeated challenger Peter Dutton by 48 votes to 35. Over the following days, there was repeated speculation about a second spill being called, without Turnbull's approval. Turnbull announced two days later that he would resign the leadership if a spill motion were passed. Dutton, Morrison and Julie Bishop announced they would stand for the leadership if that were the case. A spill motion was passed on 24 August by 45 votes to 40, and Turnbull did not run as a candidate in the resulting leadership vote. On the first ballot, Dutton received 38 votes, Morrison 36 votes, and Bishop 11 votes. On the second ballot, Morrison received 45 votes and Dutton 40 votes. He thus became leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister-designate. Josh Frydenberg was elected as the party's deputy leader, in place of Bishop. Morrison was widely seen as a compromise candidate, who was agreeable to both the moderate supporters of Turnbull and Bishop and conservatives concerned about Dutton's electability. He was sworn in as prime minister on the evening of 24 August.\n\n[7] Australia: In September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull successfully challenged Tony Abbott for leadership of the Coalition, and was sworn in as the 29th Prime Minister of Australia. The most recent federal election was held on 2 July 2016 and resulted in the Coalition's forming a majority government. On 24 August 2018, Turnbull resigned after his party voted for a leadership spill. Treasurer Scott Morrison was elected as party leader and was sworn in as prime minister later that day.\n\n[8] Leadership spill: Following the oustings of two Liberal Prime Ministers in 3 years, Scott Morrison, who won the leadership spill of 24 August 2018 introduced a new threshold to trigger a Liberal Party leadership change in government, requiring two-thirds of the partyroom vote to trigger a spill motion. The change was introduced at an hour long caucus meeting on the evening of 3 December 2018. Morrison said the changes, which were drafted with feedback from former prime ministers John Howard and Tony Abbott, would only apply to leaders who lead the party to victory at a federal election.\n\n[9] Peter Dutton: In the first August 2018 spill he challenged Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for leadership of the Liberal Party, but was defeated by 48 votes to 35. In the aftermath of the spill Dutton resigned from Second Turnbull Ministry and rejected an invitation from Turnbull to remain in the Cabinet. In the second leadership contest, Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister Scott Morrison by 45 votes to 40. Following the appointment of Scott Morrison as the new Prime Minister on 24 August by the Governor-General, Morrison re-appointed Peter Dutton to the Minister for Home Affairs, but relinquished his duties and responsibilities for Immigration and Border Protection, and appointed David Coleman as Immigration Minister.\n\n[10] Scott Morrison: Following the Coalition's victory at the 2013 election, Morrison was appointed Minister for Immigration and Border Protection in the Abbott Government. In that capacity he was responsible for implementing Operation Sovereign Borders, one of the Coalition's flagship policies. In a December 2014 cabinet reshuffle, Morrison was instead made Minister for Social Services. He was promoted to Treasurer in September 2015, when Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott as prime minister.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The Indian population reached the billion mark in 1998. India is projected to be the world's most populous country by 2024, surpassing the population of China. It is expected to become the first political entity in history to be home to more than 1.5 billion people by 2030, and its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050. Its population growth rate is 1.13%, ranking 112th in the world in 2017.\n\n[2] Indonesians: Despite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since the 1967, for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States and would - if the current US population did not rise - become the world's third biggest after China and India by 2043. The family planning already revitalised based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country.\n\n[3] Zero population growth: Albert Bartlett, an emeritus professor of physics at University of Colorado at Boulder in his lifetime, suggested that the population have following choices to be at ZPG:Similarly, Jason Brent, another demographic expert, argues that there are three ways to achieve zero population growth. His argument is as follows:China is the largest country by population in the world, being home to some 1.4 billion people. China is expected to witness a zero population growth rate by 2030. China's population growth has slowed since the beginning of this century. This was mostly the result of China's economic growth and increasing living standards which led to the decline. However, many demographers also credit China's family planning policy, which was formulated in the early 1970s, encourages late marriages, late childbearing, and the use of contraceptives, and since 1980 has limited most urban couples to one child and most rural couples to two children. According to government projections, the work-age population will then drop to 870 million. It was said, in 2009, that the Chinese government was hoping to see zero population growth in the future but, in November 2013, a relaxation of the one-child policy was announced amid unpopularity, reduced labour pool and support for an ageing population.\n\n[4] Climate resilience: China has been rapidly emerging as a new superpower, rivaling the United States. As the most populated country in the world, and one of the leaders of the global economy, China's response to the impending effects of climate change is of great concern for the entire world. A number of significant changes are expected to affect China as the looming threat of climate change becomes more and more imminent. Here's just one example; China has experienced a seven-fold increase in the frequency of floods since the 1950s, rising every decade. The frequency of extreme rainfall has increased and is predicted to continue to increase in the western and southern parts of China. The country is currently undertaking efforts to reduce the threat of these floods (which have the potential effect of completely destroying vulnerable communities), largely focusing on improving the infrastructure responsible for tracking and maintaining adequate water levels. That being said, the country is promoting the extension of technologies for water allocation and water-saving mechanisms. In the country's National Climate Change Policy Program, one of the goals specifically set out is to enhance the ability to bear the impacts of climate change, as well as to raise the public awareness on climate change. China's National Climate Change Policy states that it will integrate climate change policies into the national development strategy. In China, this national policy comes in the form of its \"Five Year Plans for Economic and Social Development\". China's Five Year Plans serve as the strategic road maps for the country's development. The goals spelled out in the Five Year Plans are mandatory as government officials are held responsible for meeting the targets.\n\n[5] Box office territory: China is considered the second largest territory, and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said in 2016 that it is expected to surpass North America in the near future. In September 2017, China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television predicted that China would surpass North America in 2020 as the number-one box office territory. In the following October, \"The Observer\" reported, \"Double-digit growth puts China back on pace to overtake North America as the No. 1 box office territory in the world within the next few years.\" In April 2018, \"Variety\" reported, \"It has frequently been predicted that the film business in China would overtake North America's. But many forecasters got their timing wrong when more than a decade of unbroken Chinese growth stalled between mid-2016 and mid-2017.\" After China's box office grew 9% in 2018 compared to 13.5% the year before, \"Variety\" reported of China surpassing North America, \"The uneven growth of recent years has undone numerous past forecasts of when that might happen.\" Reuters reported that despite the second ranking, \"[China] already has more total movie screens [than North America] after years of rapid expansion in theater networks.\"\n\n[6] Sustainability: According to the most recent (July 2015) revision of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.\n\n[7] 2010s: \"Coups d'état\" against ruling governments during the decade include:The most prominent terrorist attacks committed against civilian populations during the decade include: China was increasingly called a superpower in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President Hu Jintao and United States President Barack Obama. China overtook the US as the world's largest trading nation, filing the most patents, expanding its military, landing its lunar rover \"Yutu\" on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's Oriental Movie Metropolis as a major film and cultural center. China was projected to have the world's largest economy by 2018 with an estimated GDP per capita equal to the US by the late 2050s.\n\n[8] China: China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia and the world's most populous country, with a population of around /1e9 round 3 billion. Covering approximately , it is the third- or fourth-largest country by total area. Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n[9] Human overpopulation: In 2014 the United Nations estimated there is an 80% likelihood that the world's population will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion by 2100. Most of the world's expected population increase will be in Africa and southern Asia. Africa's population is expected to rise from the current one billion to four billion by 2100, and Asia could add another billion in the same period. Because the median age of Africans is relatively low (e.g. in Uganda it is 15 years old) birth credits would have to limit fertility to one child per two women to reach the levels of developed countries immediately. For countries with a wide base in their population pyramid it will take a generation for the people who are of child-bearing age to have their families. An example of demographic momentum is China, which added perhaps 400,000 more people after its one-child policy was enacted. Arth has suggested that the focus should be on the developed countries and that some combination of birth credits and additional compensation supplied by the developed countries could rapidly lead to zero population growth while also quickly raising the standard of living in developing countries.\n\n[10] Potential superpowers: In an interview given in 2011, Singapore's first premier, Lee Kuan Yew, stated that while China supplanting the United States is not a foregone conclusion, Chinese leaders are nonetheless serious about displacing the United States as the most powerful country in Asia. \"They have transformed a poor society by an economic miracle to become now the second-largest economy in the world. How could they not aspire to be number 1 in Asia, and in time the world?\" The Chinese strategy, Lee maintains, will revolve around their \"huge and increasingly highly skilled and educated workers to out-sell and out-build all others.\" Nevertheless, relations with the United States, at least in the medium term, will not take a turn for the worse because China will \"avoid any action that will sour up relations with the U.S. To challenge a stronger and technologically superior power like the U.S. will abort their 'peaceful rise.'\" Though Lee believes China is genuinely interested in growing within the global framework the United States has created, it is biding its time until it becomes strong enough to successfully redefine the prevailing political and economic order.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Since retiring from the foreign service in 1999, Cho was a visiting scholar at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University Law Center, as well as a Professor of International Law at the Ewha Womans University College of Law in Seoul, Korea and Chosun University in Kwangju, Korea. Cho is currently the Chairman of the Medical Peace Foundation, a non-profit organization he founded which develops medical centers in impoverished parts of the world. The foundation has developed more than 23 medical centers in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Cho also served on the South Korean Olympic Committee responsible for bringing the 1988 Summer Olympics to Seoul, as well as the South Korean Olympic Committee which vied for the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cho received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Hankuk University for Foreign Studies, his Master of Laws degree from Chosun University and his Doctorate of Law from Mariano Galvez University of Guatemala. Cho's wife is Kun-Hee, with whom he has two children, Helen and Mukang. Helen is a Professor in the Anthropology Department at Davidson College and Mukang is the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Principal of Morning Calm Management, a real estate investment and management firm.\n\n[2] Kim Hyong-uk: Kim Hyong-uk (Hangul: 김형욱, Hanja:金炯旭, January 16, 1925 – c. October 8 1979) was a South Korean brigadier general who served as director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Born in Hwanghae province, he left for the South after high school and was a classmate of future President Park Chung-hee at military academy, graduating in 1949. He was an infantry troop commander in the Korean War. He attended the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1955. As colonel, he took part in the May 16 coup in 1961, when he led a group of soldiers to take Prime Minister John M. Chang into custody. He served for two years as Minister for Home Affairs in the junta and then was director of the KCIA from March 1963 to October 1969, where he was notorious for his brutality and corruption. After refusing to support Park's bid for a third term, he was replaced as head of the KCIA by Lee Hu-rak. Reportedly, at a meeting with Park, the President asked him, \"why don't you take a rest after your long service?\" - and on returning to his office, he discovered it had already been cleared out. In 1971, he became a member of the powerless parliament. Kim went into exile in the United States in 1973.\n\n[3] Hee Il Cho: In 1962, at the age of 22, Cho entered the Korean army for compulsory military service; during that time, he taught taekwondo to special forces in the Korean, Indian, and US armies. In 1968, Cho emigrated from South Korea to the United States of America. At the time, he held the rank of 6th \"dan\". He initially moved to Chicago, but did not stay for long, moving through South Bend, Milwaukee, and Providence, before settling in Los Angeles in 1975. Cho was based in Los Angeles for around 25 years, before moving to Albuquerque, and a few years later, to Hawaii.\n\n[4] Kim Hong-il (general): Kim Hong-il (23 September 1898 – 8 August 1980) was a Korean independence activist and a general of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Korean War, who later became a diplomat and politician in South Korea. Born in North Pyongan, he did his early schooling in China and Korea, and had a brief career as a teacher before his connections with the nascent Korean independence movement led to his imprisonment. He fled into exile in China in 1918, and served in the Kuomintang's National Revolutionary Army from 1926 to 1948, following which he moved to the newly-independent South Korea to join the Republic of Korea Army. He commanded South Korea's I Corps during the first year of the Korean War, and was then sent to Taipei as South Korea's ambassador to the Republic of China, which by then had retreated to Taiwan. His assignment there ultimately lasted nine years. He returned to South Korea in 1960 following the April Revolution which ended the rule of Syngman Rhee, and served briefly as Minister of Foreign Affairs under the Park Chung-hee junta. He ran for the National Assembly, first unsuccessfully in 1960 and 1963, and was then elected in 1967 and became a major figure in the opposition New Democratic Party.\n\n[5] South Korea national football team: Following the Asian Cup, key players Park Ji-sung and Lee Young-pyo retired and the team's performance began to decline. Following a humiliating 3–0 loss to Japan and a shocking 1–2 loss to Lebanon in Beirut, Cho was unceremoniously sacked despite an initial 6–0 victory over Lebanon on home soil. He was hurriedly replaced with Choi Kang-hee with the task of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup as the team was in jeopardy of breaking its long-running streak of World Cup qualifications. Under Choi South Korea narrowly qualified for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil by finishing second in their group via goal difference. Choi's contract was up after the conclusion of the qualification matches and was replaced by former player Hong Myung-bo, who had captained the 2002 World Cup team and coached the under-23 team to a bronze medal finish at the 2012 Olympics. Despite high expectations under Hong, South Korea continued its run of poor form. A victory against Costa Rica was followed by losses to Mexico and the United States and shortly prior to the World Cup the team registered dismal losses against Tunisia and Ghana.\n\n[6] Choi Sae-hwang: After his graduation, Choi returned to Korea, where he worked as a prosecutor of the Cheongju District Court () under the Japanese colonial government. When Korea regained its independence, he found employment with the new South Korean government, first with the High Prosecutors' Office in 1948, with the Supreme Prosecutors' Office in 1949, as head of the Bureau of Prisons (행형국) under the Ministry of Justice in 1951, and as Chief Prosecutor of Jeonju in 1952. He was named South Korea's Vice-Minister of National Defense in August 1957, succeeding Kim Jeong-ryeol () who was promoted to Minister. He was one of the members of the founding committee of the Democratic Republican Party in February 1963. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed him as a representative in South Korea's discussions with Japan on a that month.\n\n[7] Kim Il-sung: Kim Il-sung (officially transcribed Kim Il Sung; ; ; ; born Kim Sŏng-ju (); 15 April 1912 – 8 July 1994) was the first leader of North Korea which he ruled from the country's establishment in 1948 until his death in 1994. He held the posts of Premier from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to 1994. He was also the leader of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) from 1949 to 1994 (titled as Chairman from 1949 to 1966 and as General Secretary after 1966). Coming to power after the end of Japanese rule in 1945, he authorized the invasion of South Korea in 1950, triggering an intervention in defense of South Korea by the United Nations led by the United States. Following the military stalemate in the Korean War, a ceasefire was signed on 27 July 1953. He was the second longest-serving non-royal head of state/government in the 20th century, in office for more than 48 years.\n\n[8] Cho Sung-min (basketball): Cho Sung-min hit the game winner in South Korea's game against Iran putting South Korea on top, 79-77.\n\n[9] Jin Kab-yong: After the competition, he began his collegiate career at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea. At Korea University, he led his team to numerous national college titles alongside his battery mates Son Min-han and Cho Sung-min, and did not miss any single international competition that the South Korea national baseball team participated during his four years at college, garnering national attention as a highly regarded baseball prospect.\n\n[10] Cho Ki-chon: Between 1942 and 1943, Cho served in the Soviet 25th Army's headquarters in Voroshilov-Ussuriysk in desk duty, and in a similar assignment in the Pacific Navy in Khabarovsk between 1943 and 1945 and in the First Far Eastern Front from October 1945. A part of his job was to write propaganda leaflets spread by the Soviet Red Army in Korea. Biographer Tatiana Gabroussenko thinks it is probable that he also translated the first speech given by Kim Il-sung after the liberation, on 14 October 1945, called \"Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea\", into Korean. The original speech was written by Soviet officers. Cho entered North Korea with the Red army that year.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to hold that office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her \"The 'Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style. As Prime Minister, she implemented policies known as Thatcherism.\n\n[2] Territorial designation: For instance, the life peerages conferred on the former Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and James Callaghan were created as \"Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire\" and \"Baron Callaghan of Cardiff, of the City of Cardiff in the County of South Glamorgan\". The part of the peerage before the comma is the actual title, and the part after the comma is the territorial designation. These peers should be referred to as \"The Baroness Thatcher\" and \"The Lord Callaghan of Cardiff\": it is incorrect both to use part of the territorial designation as part of the title and to leave out part of the actual title; thus \"The Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven\" and \"The Lord Callaghan\" are incorrect, although the latter may be used informally.\n\n[3] Peerages in the United Kingdom: In speech, any peer or peeress except a Duke or Duchess is referred to as \"Lord X\" or \"Lady X\". The exception is a \"suo jure\" baroness (that is, one holding the dignity in her own right, usually a life peeress), who may also be called \"Baroness X\" in normal speech, though \"Lady X\" is also common usage. Hence, Baroness Thatcher, a \"suo jure\" life peeress, was referred to as either \"Baroness Thatcher\" or \"Lady Thatcher\". \"Baroness\" is incorrect for female holders of Scottish Lordships of Parliament, who are not Baronesses; for example, the 21st Lady Saltoun is known as \"Lady Saltoun\", not \"Baroness Saltoun\".\n\n[4] Denis Thatcher: In December 1990, following the resignation of his wife as Prime Minister, it was announced that Denis Thatcher would be created a baronet (the first such creation since 1964). The award was gazetted in February 1991, giving his title as Sir Denis Thatcher, 1st Baronet, of Scotney in the County of Kent. Thus Margaret was entitled to style herself Lady Thatcher while retaining her seat in the House of Commons; however she made it known that she preferred to be addressed as \"Mrs Thatcher\", and did not use the title. She was created a life peeress as Baroness Thatcher, thus Lady Thatcher in her own right, upon her retirement from the Commons after the 1992 general election.\n\n[5] Lady: Margaret Thatcher was informally referred to in the same way by many of her political colleagues when Prime Minister of Great Britain. Her husband was later created a baronet, thus making her \"Lady Thatcher\" as of right. After she retired, she was given a barony as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, and was thereafter known as \"The Lady Thatcher\".\n\n[6] Jean Barker, Baroness Trumpington: On leaving the UN post and entering the House of Lords, she was introduced as a Baroness-in-waiting from 1983 to 1985. Thatcher recognised her capabilities when she was given a ministerial post. Despite being in the Lords as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Health and Social Security from 1985–87, during which time she smoked cigarettes, and in spite of a deep concern for women's mental health with numerous charities, she would \"in perpetuum\" champion the cause of smokers to do what they wanted. A stubborn streak of wilful independence was typical of the Thatcherite in her, which she never lost up until her final \"verbatim\" speech in the Lords.\n\n[7] Mark Thatcher: Thatcher is entitled the usage of the pre-nominal style \"The Honourable\" following the elevation of his mother to the peerage as a baroness in 1992; he shares this courtesy with his twin sister, Carol. After the death of his father in 2003, he inherited the Thatcher baronetcy which had been awarded in 1990, the first baronetcy created since 1964. Following his conviction in relation to the Equatorial Guinea coup d'état in 2004, it was suggested that he should be stripped of the title.\n\n[8] Margaret Thatcher: Thatcher became a member of the Lords in 1992 with a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire. Subsequently, the College of Arms granted her usage of a personal coat of arms; she was allowed to revise these arms upon her appointment as Lady of the Order of the Garter (LG) in 1995, the highest order of chivalry for women.\n\n[9] The Iron Lady (film): The film's depiction of Thatcher has been criticised by her children, Mark and Carol, who are reported to have said, before completion of the film, that \"it sounds like some left-wing fantasy.\" Stuart Jeffries of the British newspaper \"The Guardian\" was cautiously optimistic about a non-British actor playing Thatcher. Karen Sue Smith of \"America\" wrote that \"by combining the Baroness's real roles of wife, mother and leader, the film's portrait of her does what many purported \"lives of great men\" fail to do – namely, show the person in context, in the quotidian.\"\n\n[10] Carol Thatcher: Thatcher was born in Hammersmith, London, on 15 August 1953. She and her twin brother, Mark, were born six weeks prematurely by C-section. According to Margaret Thatcher, her husband Denis Thatcher responded to seeing their children for the first time by saying, \"My God, they look like rabbits. Put them back.\" Thatcher's mother was selected for Finchley in 1958 and was elected as a Member of Parliament in 1959.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of game, dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of spices from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive. Irn-Bru is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as \"Scotland's other national drink\" (after whisky). During the Late Middle Ages and early modern era, French cuisine played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the \"Auld Alliance\", especially during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.\n\n[2] Irn-Bru: Irn-Bru ( \"iron brew\") is a Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as \"Scotland's other national drink\" (after whisky). It is produced in Westfield, Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, by A.G. Barr of Glasgow, since moving out of their Parkhead factory in the mid-2000s. In 2011, Irn Bru closed their factory in Mansfield, making the Westfield plant in Cumbernauld the main location for production. In addition to being sold throughout the United Kingdom, Barr's Irn-Bru is available throughout the world and can usually be purchased where there is a significant community of people from Scotland. Innovative and sometimes controversial marketing campaigns have kept it as the number one selling soft drink in Scotland, where it competes directly with global brands such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\n[3] A.G. Barr: A.G. BARR p.l.c., commonly known as Barr's, is a Scottish soft drink manufacturer, based in Cumbernauld, Scotland. It manufactures the popular Scottish drink, Irn-Bru. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\n[4] Soft drink: While the term \"soft drink\" is commonly used in product labeling and on restaurant menus, in many countries these drinks are more commonly referred to by regional names, including carbonated drink, cool drink, cold drink, fizzy drink, fizzy juice, lolly water, pop, seltzer, soda, coke, soda pop, tonic, and mineral. Due to the high sugar content in typical soft drinks, they may also be called sugary drinks.\n\n[5] Soft drink: The origins of soft drinks lie in the development of fruit-flavored drinks. In the medieval Middle East, a variety of fruit-flavoured soft drinks were widely drunk, such as sharbat, and were often sweetened with ingredients such as sugar, syrup and honey. Other common ingredients included lemon, apple, pomegranate, tamarind, jujube, sumac, musk, mint and ice. Middle-Eastern drinks later became popular in medieval Europe, where the word \"syrup\" was derived from Arabic. In Tudor England, 'water imperial' was widely drunk; it was a sweetened drink with lemon flavor and containing cream of tartar. 'Manays Cryste' was a sweetened cordial flavored with rosewater, violets or cinnamon.\n\n[6] Soft drink: In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the terms \"fizzy drink\" and the genericized trademark \"coke\" are common. \"Pop\" and \"fizzy pop\" are used in Northern England and the Midlands, while \"mineral\" or \"lemonade\" (as a general term) are used in Ireland. In Scotland, \"fizzy juice\" or even simply \"juice\" is colloquially encountered. In Australia and New Zealand, \"fizzy drink\" or \"soft drink\" is typically used. In South African English, \"cool drink\" and \"cold drink\" are used, but in South African Indian English, \"cool drink\" is most prevalent. Older people often use the term \"mineral\".\n\n[7] Ireland: Stout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly \"Magners\" (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as \"Bulmers\"), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.\n\n[8] Soft drink: Soft drinks are mixed with other ingredients in several contexts. In Western countries, in bars and other places where alcohol is served (e.g. airplanes, restaurants and nightclubs), many mixed drinks are made by blending a soft drink with hard liquor and serving the drink over ice. One well-known example is the rum and coke, which may also contain lime juice. Some homemade fruit punch recipes, which may or may not contain alcohol, contain a mixture of various fruit juices and a soft drink (e.g. ginger ale). At ice cream parlours and 1950s-themed diners, ice cream floats, and specifically root beer floats, are often sold.\n\n[9] List of soft drinks by country: This is a list of soft drinks in order of the brand's country of origin. A soft drink is a beverage that typically contains water (often, but not always, carbonated water), usually a sweetener and usually a flavoring agent. The sweetener may be sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, sugar substitutes (in the case of diet drinks) or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives and other ingredients.\n\n[10] Squirt (soft drink): In 1941, a mascot named \"Lil' Squirt\" was created for marketing the product. Squirt became a popular soft drink in many parts of the country, especially the West and Southwest. In the 1950s, it became commonly used as a mixer used in cocktails.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Arnold designed a toilet seat bidet system, which featured a nozzle that sprayed warm water and blew hot air. In 1964 Arnold patented his design, founded the American Bidet Company, and started marketing the innovative bidet product, dubbed \"American Sitzbath\", by using large ads and attending trade shows. It was intended for use at hospitals by patients who had difficulty using toilet paper or reaching around to wipe themselves. Arnold installed thousands of these seats all over the suburbs of New York, and the company had offices all across the country, but due to cultural barriers advertising was almost impossible and few wanted to run the ads that the company produced.\n\n[2] Electronic bidet: Following the failure of the product in North America, Cohen licensed his invention and patent to the TOTO company in Japan. In 1967, TOTO imported Arnold's bidet system, now rebranded as 'Wash Air Seat' in Japan. The bidet system failed in Japan as well, because it was too expensive and the bidet function was too foreign for Japanese consumers.\n\n[3] Bidet: The bidet appears to have been an invention of French furniture makers in the late 17th century, although no exact date or inventor is known. The earliest written reference to the bidet is in 1726 in Italy. Even though there are records of Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily, requesting a bidet for her personal bathroom in the Royal Palace of Caserta in the second half of the 18th century, the bidet did not diffuse in Italy until after WWII. The bidet is possibly associated with the \"chamber pot\" and the \"bourdaloue\", the latter being a small, hand-held chamber pot.\n\n[4] Alfred Binet: Alfred Binet (; July 8, 1857 – October 18, 1911) was a French psychologist who invented the first practical IQ test, the Binet–Simon test. In 1904, the French Ministry of Education asked psychologist Alfred Binet to devise a method that would determine which students did not learn effectively from regular classroom instruction so they could be given remedial work. Along with his collaborator Théodore Simon, Binet published revisions of his test in 1908 and 1911, the last of which appeared just before his death.\n\n[5] Bidet: In 1980, the first \"paperless toilet\" was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto, a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, and are found in approximately 76% of Japanese households . They are commonly found in hotels and some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat and bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries, including the United States.\n\n[6] Bidet: The early 1980s saw the introduction of the electronic bidet from Japan, with names such as Clean Sense, Galaxy, Infinity, Novita, and of non-electric attachments such as Gobidet. These devices have attachments that connect to existing toilet water supplies, and can be used for bathrooms lacking the space for both a separate bidet and toilet having advantages such as instant heating warm water, night lights and a heated seat.\n\n[7] Anal hygiene: The first \"paperless\" toilet seat was invented in Japan in 1980. A spray toilet seat, commonly known by Toto's trademark Washlet, is typically a combination of seat warmer, bidet and drier, controlled by an electronic panel or remote control next to the toilet seat. A nozzle placed at rear of the toilet bowl aims a water jet to the anus and serves the purpose of cleaning. Many models have a separate \"bidet\" function aimed towards the front for feminine cleansing. The spray toilet seat is common only in Western-style toilets, and is not incorporated in traditional style squat toilets. Some modern Japanese bidet toilets, especially in hotels and public areas, are labeled with pictograms to avoid language problems, and most newer models have a sensor that will refuse to activate the bidet unless someone is sitting on the toilet.\n\n[8] Albert Benjamin: Albert L. Benjamin (1 April 1909 – 17 January 2006) was a Scottish international bridge player who invented a popular variant on the Acol bidding system. He lived in Glasgow all his life, though his father came from Sweden and his mother from Siberia. He was a leading player in his day, wrote a daily bridge column from 1937 to 1976, ran a bridge club, and was an excellent teacher of bridge.\n\n[9] Bidet: A bidet shower (also known as \"bidet spray\", \"bidet sprayer\", or \"health faucet\") is a hand-held triggered nozzle, similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in anal cleansing and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.\n\n[10] Anal hygiene: Some people in Europe and the Americas use bidets for anal cleansing with water. Bidets are common bathroom fixtures in many Western and Southern European countries and many South American countries, while bidet showers are more common in Finland. The availability of bidets varies widely within this group of countries. Furthermore, even where bidets exist, they may have other uses than for anal washing.In Italy, the installation of bidets in every household and hotel became mandatory by law in 1975.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

This is the last season in which Dallas Jokic, Robert Naylor, Lyle O'Donohoe, Dakota Goyo, and Alexina Cowan voice Arthur, D.W., the Brain, Timmy and Catherine, respectively. This is also the final season to be produced by Cookie Jar Entertainment and to be animated with traditional animation. In the next season, 9 Story Media Group produces this series and the show switches to Flash animation, and would also be the first season in the US to air in the 1080i widescreen format where it was previously only done in foreign markets.\n\n[2] Arthur (season 12): The 12th season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from October 6, 2008 to April 24, 2009 and contains 20 episodes. The 10 episodes listed below were broadcast as season 12, and the other 10 were broadcast as season 13. This resulted all of season 13 episodes airing in several countries such as Canada and United Kingdom for many months prior the U.S. broadcast. This season was created and originally aired in the widescreen format though still in 480i; in the U.S., they were and continue to be aired in , with the left and right sides cropped out. The animation was produced by Animation Services HK Ltd. instead of by AKOM. This was also the first season where Michael Hirsh was credited as the executive producer.\n\n[3] Arthur (season 10): The 10th season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally produced in 2006 and broadcast on PBS in the United States from May 15 to 26, 2006 and contains 10 episodes. The DVD set for the season was released in region 1 on March 25, 2008. This included downloadable teaching materials and described video for the visually impaired. Guest stars were Édgar Rentería, Mike Timlin, Johnny Damon, and Ming Tsai. This is the last season in which Jason Szwimmer voices D.W. This is the third season of Arthur where the episodes aired in one month, following seasons 4 and 7.\n\n[4] Arthur (season 19): The 19th season of the television series \"Arthur\" contains 10 episodes. These episodes were broadcast in early 2015 on CBBC in the UK, and aired on PBS in the US from June 2, 2015 from May 26, 2016. This season was produced along with season 18 in 2013, and is the last season to be animated by 9 Story Media Group, starting next season, Oasis Animation takes over. This is also the last season where William Healy voices Arthur, Andrew Dayton voices D.W., and Jacob Ewaniuk and Jake Sim voice the Tibble Twins, respectively.\n\n[5] Arthur (season 20): The 20th season of \"Arthur\" began broadcast on PBS in the United States on October 10, 2016, and finished on June 1, 2017. In this season, Oasis Animation took over animation from 9 Story Media Group, and reduced the number of episodes to 7 instead of the usual 10. This is the shortest season of the series, lacking the usual number of 10 episodes that has been the number of episodes in every season since season 4.\n\n[6] Arthur (season 3): The 3rd season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from November 16, 1998 to January 1, 1999 and contains 15 episodes. This season, like seasons 1 and 2, was released on DVD in Europe only (as \"Series 4\"). This season had a fair amount of episodes involving D.W. and the Tibble Twins, especially in the early half.\n\n[7] Arthur (season 13): The 13th season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from October 12, 2009 to April 9, 2010 and contains 10 episodes. All episodes from this season aired on several countries outside the U.S., such as CBBC in United Kingdom and TVOKids in Canada, prior to their U.S. airdates.\n\n[8] Arthur (season 5): The 5th season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from September 25 to November 27, 2000 and contains 10 episodes. The special \"Arthur's Perfect Christmas\" served as the finale to this season. Steven Crowder replaced Luke Reid as Brain. This is the last season where Michael Yarmush voices Arthur due to his voice changing. Starting in season 9, he returns to voice the character Slink, one of the Tough Customers. Alex Trebek guest starred as Alex Lebek on the season premiere \"Arthur and the Big Riddle\".\n\n[9] Arthur (season 2): The 2nd season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from October 20, 1997 to April 17, 1998 and contains 20 episodes. This season, like seasons 1 and 3, was released on DVD in Europe only; due to the fact that this was actually two production seasons (the first ten episodes encompassing the first and the last ten encompassing the second) combined into one long season for US airings, the first ten episodes for this season can be found on the \"Series 2\" DVD and the last ten can be found on \"Series 3.\"\n\n[10] Arthur (season 7): The 7th season of the television series \"Arthur\" was originally broadcast on PBS in the United States from October 8 to November 29, 2002 and contains 10 episodes.

Alex Hood is cast as the new voice of Alan \"The Brain\" Powers, replacing Steven Crowder. Mark Rendall replaced Justin Bradley as Arthur (who would later dub on re-runs of season 6, due to Justin Bradley's dialogue being unfavorable). This is the last season in which Patricia Rodriguez voices Catherine Frensky, and this is the final season in which Mitchell Rothpan voices George Lundgren. The series won a Daytime Emmy in 2003 for  \"Outstanding Sound Mixing - Live Action and Animation\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Species of this genus infect a wide variety of hosts. Thirty-one species are known to occur in bats (Chiroptera), two in turtles, and 130 named species infect fish. Two species (\"E. phocae\" and \"E. weddelli\") infect seals. Five species infect llamas and alpacas: \"E. alpacae\", \"E. ivitaensis\", \"E. lamae\", \"E. macusaniensis\", and \"E. punonensis\". A number of species infect rodents, including \"E. couesii\", \"E. kinsellai\", \"E. palustris\", \"E. ojastii\" and \"E. oryzomysi\". Others infect poultry (\"E. necatrix\" and \"E. tenella\"), rabbits (\"E. stiedae\") and cattle (\"E. bovis\", \"E. ellipsoidalis\", and \"E. zuernii\"). For full species list, see below.\n\n[2] Eimeria kinsellai: Eimeria kinsellai is an apicomplexan parasite of the genus \"Eimeria\" that infects the marsh rice rat (\"Oryzomys palustris\"). It was discovered in 1970 at Paynes Prairie, Alachua County, Florida. A different \"Eimeria\", \"Eimeria palustris\", has been found in Alabama marsh rice rats. \"E. kinsellai\" differs from other \"Eimeria\" found in rice rats, such as \"Eimeria couesii\", \"Eimeria oryzomysi\", \"Eimeria ojastii\", and \"E. palustris\", in anatomical details. It was named after parasitologist John M. Kinsella.\n\n[3] Eimeria palustris: Eimeria palustris is an apicomplexan parasite of the genus \"Eimeria\" that infects the marsh rice rat (\"Oryzomys palustris\"). It was discovered in 1970 at Tuskegee National Forest, Macon County, Alabama. A different \"Eimeria\", \"Eimeria kinsellai\", has been found in Florida marsh rice rats. \"E. palustris\" differs from other \"Eimeria\" found in rice rats, such as \"Eimeria couesii\", \"Eimeria oryzomysi\", \"Eimeria ojastii\", and \"E. kinsellai\", in anatomical details. Its specific epithet refers to that of its type host, \"Oryzomys palustris\".\n\n[4] Eimeria couesii: Eimeria couesii is an apicomplexan parasite of the genus \"Eimeria\" that infects the intestine of the rice rat \"Oryzomys couesi\" in Mexico. It has an oocyst residuum and Stieda bodies, structures that are absent in some other \"Eimeria\".\n\n[5] Eimeria zuernii: Eimeria zuernii is a species of the parasite \"Eimeria\" that causes diarrheic disease known as eimeriosis in cattle (\"Bos taurus\"), and mainly affects younger animals. The disease is also commonly referred to as coccidiosis. The parasite can be found in cattle around the globe.\n\n[6] Eimeria: Infection with \"Eimeria\" results in life-long immunity to that particular parasite species, but does not give cross protection against other species. For these reasons, vaccines for control seem promising, of which live attenuated vaccines are most effective. However, the search for highly immunogenic antigens and overcoming antigenic variation of the parasites remains a challenge. Immunity to the parasite varies depending on parasite and host species, as well as the site of invasion. CD4+ T cells and interferon gamma (γ) are crucial components of natural immunity to infection. Humoral immunity is thought to play little role in protection, and is most likely mediated through secretory IgA antibodies.\n\n[7] Eimeria zuernii: The majority of the parasites life is in the environment and both survival of the parasite as well as developing into an infective oocysts depends on these factors. The time from when the parasite has left the animal in the faeces inside an oocyst and has developed in to a parasite that can infect new animals, is called the sporulation time. High humidity and temperature can speed up the sporulation time and facilitate new infections faster, which can lead to regular outbreaks of coccidiosis.  Unsporulated \"Eimeria zuernii\" oocysts can handle -18 degrees Celsius for a month and still be able to sporulate.\n\n[8] Eimeria: The \"Eimeria\" life cycle has an exogenous phase, during which the oocysts are excreted into the environment, and an endogenous phase, where parasite development occurs in the host intestine. During the endogenous phase, several rounds of asexual reproduction, or schizogony take place, after which the sexual differentiation of gametes and fertilisation occurs. Parasite transmission occurs via the oral-fecal route. Infections are common in farming environments where many animals are confined in a small space.\n\n[9] Arctic hare: Four groups of parasites have been known to use Arctic hares as a host: protozoans (\"Eimeria exigua\", \"E. magna\", \"E. perforans\", and \"E. sculpta\"); nematodes (including \"Filaria\" and \"Oxyuris ambigua\"); lice (including \"Haemodipsus lyriocephalus\" and \"H. setoni\") and fleas (including \"Hoplopsyllus glacialis\", \"Euhoplopsyllus glacialis\", and \"Megabothris groenlandicus\". Fleas are more common than parasitic worms.\n\n[10] Columbian ground squirrel: Columbian ground squirrels may be parasitized by the Rocky Mountain wood tick (\"Dermacentor andersoni\"), which is a carrier for the bacteria that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Other external parasites include the lice \"Enderleinellus suturalis\" and \"Neohaemotopinus laeviusculus\"; the fleas \"Neopsylla inopina\", \"Opisocrostis tuberculatus\", and \"Oropsylla idahoensis\"; the mites \"Dermacarus heptneri\", \"Androlaelaps fahrenholz\", \"Macrocheles sp.\", and \"Pygmephorus erlangensis\". Internal parasites include \"Trypanosoma\" species \"Trypanosoma otospermophili\", and the \"Eimeria\" species: \"Eimeria bilamellata\", \"Eimeria callospermophili\", and \"Eimeria lateralis\". Instances of presence of \"Yersinia pestis\", the cause of the black plague, have been reported. They may be a reservoir for Powassan or St Louis encephalitis virus, based on some antibody screening analyses. Columbian ground squirrels may also suffer dermatitis from \"Dermatophilus congolensis\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He was noted for his work in the transition between neo-classicism and functionalism in Norwegian architecture. Blakstad was born in Gjerpen, Norway. He was the son of Wilhelm Eriksen Blakstad (1863-1963) and Gunvor Kjos (1855-1932). Blakstad was educated at the Norwegian Institute of Technology where he graduated in 1916. From 1922 he started his own practice in Oslo together with Arnstein Arneberg and Herman Munthe-Kaas. He would maintain a partnership with Herman Munthe-Kaas in the architectural firm Blakstad og Munthe-Kaas Arkitekter for more than 50 years. During the period 1922-1960, they participated in 66 contests, won prizes in 33 of them, of which all 22 were first prizes. The firm collaborated on several significant assignments in Norway including Kunstnernes Hus for which they were awarded the Houens fonds diplom in 1931. Their work also included the City Hall in Haugesund (1931), Elgeseter Bridge (1951) in Trondheim, Bodø Cathedral (1956) in the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland and Alfaset chapel (1972) in Oslo. He also drew Det Nye Teater with Jens Gram Dunker.\n\n[2] Ragnvald Blakstad: Blakstad was born at Asker in Akershus, Norway. He was born to Erik Jørgensen Blakstad (1827–90) and Larine (Laura) Gabrielsen (1832–68). He was a brother of both Finn Blakstad and Wilhelm Blakstad as well as an uncle of Gudolf Blakstad. Their father, together with Ole H. Holta (1851–1928), had started the lumber company, Blakstad, Holta & Co, in Skien.\n\n[3] Wilhelm Blakstad: He was born at Blakstad farm in Asker as a son of Erik Jørgensen Blakstad (1827–1890) and his wife Laura Gabrielsen (1832–1868). He was married to Gønner Kjos (1855–1932), and was the father of architect Gudolf Blakstad. Wilhelm Blakstad was also a brother of Finn and Ragnvald Blakstad and a first cousin of Torger, Wilhelm and Bernt Holtsmark.\n\n[4] Adolf Bogstad: He was born and lived in Østre Aker. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he became involved in Hjemmefronten in 1940 and Milorg in 1941. He was involved in weapons transport and the illegal press, and became the leader of District 13. His last action was \"Aksjon smør\", in which Milorg men stole foodstuffs from two warehouses, one in the street \"Tollbugata\" belonging to German forces, and one in the street \"Skippergata\" belonging to Arbeidstjenesten. The foodstuffs were distributed to Milorg men who hid in the forests surrounding Oslo.\n\n[5] Finn Blakstad: He was born at Blakstad farm in Asker as a son of Erik Jørgensen Blakstad (1827–1890) and his wife Laura Gabrielsen (1832–1868). Finn Blakstad was also a brother of Wilhelm and Ragnvald Blakstad, a first cousin of Torger, Wilhelm and Bernt Holtsmark and an uncle of Gudolf Blakstad.\n\n[6] Blakstad, Aust-Agder: Blakstad or Blakstad-Osedalen is a village which is also the administrative centre of the municipality of Froland in Aust-Agder county, Norway. It is located along the river Nidelva, about northwest of the town of Arendal (where many residents of Blakstad work and shop). The small village of Froland lies about to the north, on the west side of the river, and that is where Froland Church is located.\n\n[7] Gina Barstad: In the 2009 parliamentary election, Barstad who resides in Bergen was nominated as the Socialist Left's second candidate in Hordaland, behind Audun Lysbakken. Although the Socialist Left only received one representative in Hordaland, Lysbakken was picked as new Minister of Children and Equality in the Stoltenberg Cabinet, so Barstad met in parliament as a fixed deputy member until Lysbakkens resignment from the cabinet and return to parliament in March 2012. She was one of the youngest representatives in Parliament.\n\n[8] Bjug Harstad: Bjug Aanondson was one of ten children born on the Harstad farm near Valle in Aust-Agder, Norway. In 1861 his family emigrated to the United States. Bjug was a student at Luther College from 1865 to 1871. He studied theology at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis from 1871 to 1874. It was his experiences there that became the model for the rest of his scholarly and religious life. After seminary, he traveled as a pastor to remote areas of Minnesota, where he built schools and churches. Harstad married Guro Svensdatter Omlid in 1877. From 1877 to 1891 he was pastor in Mayville and missionary in the Red River Valley of North Dakota. He was the founder of seventeen congregations; president of the Minnesota District of the Norwegian Synod (1884-1892); and founder of three academies: Franklin School (1878), Gran Boarding School (1880), and the Bruflat Academy (1889), all in North Dakota.\n\n[9] Daniel Berg Hestad: Hestad has 8 caps for the Norwegian national team, between 1998 and 2003, as well as a multitude of junior and youth internationals. In 1998, he was a part of the Norwegian U-21 team, that won bronze medal in 1998 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. In the final qualifier before the tournament he captained the Norwegian side against a French side containing Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet, Patrick Vieira and Ludovic Giuly. Berg Hestad scored the third goal for Norway to put them up 0-3 in Valenciennes. Norway ended up winning 2-3 and qualified.\n\n[10] Herman Munthe-Kaas: Herman Munthe-Kaas (25 May 1890 – 5 May 1977) was a Norwegian architect. He was primarily known for his functionalist building designs. Munthe-Kaas was born at Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Marius William Munthe-Kaas (1856-1926) and Hermine Cathrine Blichfeldt (1863-1937). Munthe-Kaas graduated from Kristiania tekniske skole (now Oslo University College) in 1910 and Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry (\"Statens Håndverks- og Kunstindustriskole\") in 1912. He apprenticed with Arnstein Arneberg from 1916-18. In 1918, Munthe Kaas attended the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and during 1919-20 the Academy of Arts in Copenhagen.  Together with Gudolf Blakstad, he started the architectural firm Blakstad and Munthe-Kaas Architects in 1922. The firm discontinued a few years after Gudolf Blakstad death in 1989. The firm collaborated on several significant assignments in Norway including Kunstnernes Hus for which they were awarded the Houens fonds diplom in 1931. Their work also included the City Hall in Haugesund (1931), Elgeseter Bridge (1951) in Trondheim, Bodø Cathedral (1956) in the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland and Alfaset chapel (1972) in Oslo.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHow many cards are there in a deck of Uno?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Uno (card game): The deck consists of 108 cards: four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four,\" and 25 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of \"Skip,\" \"Draw Two,\" and \"Reverse.\" These last three types are known as \"action cards.\"\n\n[2] Uno Attack: Uno Attack (called Uno Extreme in the United Kingdom and Canada) is one of many variations on the popular Mattel card game \"Uno\". It includes 112 (106 in the later versions) cards as well as a mechanical card launcher.\n\n[3] Uno (card game): Uno versions available on the Xbox 360:Several sports teams each have 112-card sets, featuring players from those teams. The special cards in each deck vary depending on the card set itself. The following teams have confirmed Uno sets. Many variations from standard gameplay exist, such as Elimination Uno, Speed Uno, French Uno, Pirate Uno, and Pakistani Uno.\n\n[4] Uno (card game): Uno (; from Italian and Spanish for 'one'; stylized as UNO) is an American shedding-type card game that is played with a specially printed deck. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games. The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. It has been a Mattel brand since 1992. When his family and friends began to play more and more, he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made. He sold it from his barbershop at first, and local businesses began to sell it as well. Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak, a funeral parlor owner in Joliet, Illinois, for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game. Tezak formed International Games, Inc., to market UNO, with offices behind his funeral parlor. The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood, Illinois. In 1992, International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies. There can be 2-10 players.\n\n[5] Uno (card game): A player holding only one card is required to call out \"Uno\" or risk being penalized if caught. A player who calls \"Uno\" risks being the target of concerted action by the other players, who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out. Depending on the level and seriousness of play, some players may deliberately avoid saying \"Uno\", in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn. For this reason, it is useful to conceal how many cards are in your hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds.\n\n[6] Uno Attack: \"UNO Attack\" comes with a special mechanical card launcher that runs on 3 C batteries. The card shooter contains a receptacle where the deck of cards is placed, and a button on the front, known as the \"Launcher Button\". When the rules call for a player to \"Hit\" the card shooter, the player presses the button on the card shooter. An electronic chime sounds, and a random number of cards shoot out. As many as 12 cards have been known to shoot out.\n\n[7] Game: Card games use a deck of cards as their central tool. These cards may be a standard Anglo-American (52-card) deck of playing cards (such as for bridge, poker, Rummy, etc.), a regional deck using 32, 36 or 40 cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German game skat), a tarot deck of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of trick-taking games collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi games), or a deck specific to the individual game (such as \"Set\" or 1000 Blank White Cards). Uno and Rook are examples of games that were originally played with a standard deck and have since been commercialized with customized decks. Some collectible card games such as \"\" are played with a small selection of cards that have been collected or purchased individually from large available sets.\n\n[8] Universal Fighting System: A \"UFS\" deck for standard, extended, and legacy consists of a minimum of 60 cards (including the character), and no more than four copies of a given card may be in a deck. Due to the large number of cards drawn during a typical game, it is common for decks to exceed the 60 card minimum in order to increase the variety of cards available. For turbo, a deck consists of exactly 41 cards (including the character) with the same restrictions of no more than four copies of a given card. Draft and sealed are a play environment where the card pool to build a deck from is a set of random booster packs. The minimum deck size for draft and sealed is the same as turbo except that a deck can have more than four copies of any given card.\n\n[9] Rack-O: The deck consists of 60 cards, each containing a number from 1 to 60. Depending on how many people are playing, the deck may be reduced in size. If two people are playing, only the cards from 1 to 40 are used; if three people are playing, the cards from 1 to 50 are used; and if four people are playing, the entire deck is used. Each player has a rack containing 10 slots to hold their cards.\n\n[10] Card game: Most of these games however typically use a specially made deck of cards designed specifically for the game (or variations of it). The decks are thus usually proprietary, but may be created by the game's players. Uno, Phase 10, Set, and 1000 Blank White Cards are popular dedicated-deck card games; 1000 Blank White Cards is unique in that the cards for the game are designed by the players of the game while playing it; there is no commercially available deck advertised as such.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

III, c. 4) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of England passed in 1696, the long title of which is \"An Act for preventing Charge and Expence in Elections of Members to serve in Parliament.\" It was intended to counter bribery of the electorate at parliamentary elections, and it established that no candidate was to make any \"Gift Reward or Entertainment\" to a particular person, or a place in general, in order to be elected to serve in Parliament. This included acts by the candidate themselves, on their behalf, or at their expense, and both direct or indirect activity. Any person found guilty of engaging in, promising, or allowing such behaviour was to be considered incapacitated from serving in Parliament, and would not be allowed to take their seat or vote. To all intents and purposes, this would annul their election as a member.\n\n[2] Independent Corrupt Practices Commission: The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), (in full the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission) is a Nigerian agency that was inaugurated on 29 September 2000 following the recommendation of President Olusegun Obasanjo. The mandate is to receive and investigate reports of corruption and in appropriate cases prosecute the offender(s), to examine, review and enforce the correction of corruption prone systems and procedures of public bodies, with a view to eliminating corruption in public life, and to educate and enlighten the public on and against corruption and related offences with a view to enlisting and fostering public support for the fight against corruption. The Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Act 2000 governs the committee's activities.\n\n[3] Corrupt practices: Corrupt practices were created in United Kingdom common law through the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854, although statutes for the prevention of specific offences had been passed in 1416, 1695, 1809, 1827, 1829, and 1842. The Act was modified, amended or extended by later legislation, for example the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883.\n\n[4] Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: The core aim of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is to prohibit companies and their individual officers from influencing foreign officials with any personal payments or rewards. The FCPA applies to any person who has a certain degree of connection to the United States and engages in corrupt practices abroad, as well as to U.S. businesses, foreign corporations trading securities in the U.S., American nationals, citizens, and residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice, whether or not they are physically present in the U.S. This is considered the nationality principle of the Act. Any individuals involved in these activities may face prison time.\n\n[5] Police corruption: To further ensure societal security from police corruption, the \"Permanent Commission Against Corruption\" (PCAC) was established in 1988. The PCAC entirely deals with investigations for alleged or suspected police corruption practices. The PCAC comprises one chairman, and two members who are selected by the Malta President and act on advice of the Prime Minister. Article 4 of Chapter 326 \"Permanent Commission Against Corruption Act\" 1988 highlights the functions of the Commission, these include: considering and investigating alleged or suspected corrupt practices; investigating ‘the conduct of any public officer’; investigating ‘any person who is/has been entrusted with functions relating to the administration of a partnership where the Government has a controlling interest’ and the Commission believes such conduct may be corrupt; investigating ‘practices and procedures of government departments where the Government has a controlling interest to facilitate the discovery of any corrupt practices’; and, to ‘instruct, advise and assist ministers who are entrusted with the administration of government departments where the government has a controlling interest on ways in which corrupt practices could be eliminated’. Reports of the Commission's findings are then submitted to the Minister of Justice.\n\n[6] Federal Corrupt Practices Act: The Federal Corrupt Practices Act, also known as the Publicity Act, was a federal law of the United States that was enacted in 1910 and amended in 1911 and 1925. It remained the nation's primary law regulating campaign finance in federal elections until the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971. The Act of Congress was enacted on June 25, 1910 by US President William Howard Taft.\n\n[7] Compliance and ethics program: In an effort to restore faith in American business, in December 1977 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law. This anti-bribery provision makes it “unlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.” (United States Department of Justice 2006) The law also requires publicly traded companies “to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent the company’s transactions. Additionally, it requires these companies to have an adequate systems of internal accounting controls.” (United States Department of Justice 2006)\n\n[8] Foreign Corrupt Practices Act: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) (, \"et seq.\") is a United States federal law known primarily for two of its main provisions: one that addresses accounting transparency requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and another concerning bribery of foreign officials. The Act was amended in 1988 and in 1998, and has been subject to continued congressional concerns, namely whether its enforcement discourages U.S. companies from investing abroad.\n\n[9] Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889: Specifically, the Act prohibited a person covered by the Act, whether by himself, or in conjunction with any other person, from corruptly soliciting or receiving, or agreeing to receive, for himself, or any other person, any gift, loan, fee, reward or advantage whatever as an inducement to, or reward for, doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed, in which the public body is concerned. A person may also not corruptly promise, or offer, any gift, loan, fee, reward, or advantage whatsoever, to any person, whether for the benefit of that person, or of another person, as an inducement to or reward for doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction whatsoever, actual or proposed; in which the public body is concerned.\n\n[10] Corrupt Practices Act 1695: It was repealed by section 1 of the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854 (c.102).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat does display behaviour in animals associated with?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Display (zoology): Display behaviour is a set of ritualized behaviours that enable an animal to communicate to other animals (typically of the same species) about specific stimuli . These ritualized behaviours can be visual however many animals depend on a mixture of visual, audio, tactical and/or chemical signals as well . Evolution has tailored these stereotyped behaviours to allow animals to communicate both conspecifically and interspecifically which allows for a broader connection in different niches in an ecosystem. It is connected to sexual selection and survival of the species in various ways. Typically, display behaviour is used for courtship between two animals and to signal to the female that a viable male is ready to mate . In other instances, species may exhibit territorial display behaviour, in order to preserve a foraging or hunting territory for its family or group. A third form is exhibited by tournament species in which males will fight in order to gain the 'right' to breed.Animals from a broad range of evolutionary hierarchies avail of display behaviours- from invertebrates such as the simple jumping spider to the more complex vertebrates like the harbour seal.\n\n[2] Display (zoology): Display behaviour is a set of very conspicuous behaviours that allows for the attraction of mates but also can result in the attraction of predators. As a result, animals have certain environmental and social cues that they can use to decide when is the most beneficial time to show such behaviours; they use these triggers to minimize cost (predator avoidance) and maximize gain (mate attraction). The first factor is temporal. Depending on the time of the season, animals (more specifically, tropical frogs, in this study) show strong seasonal trends in display behaviour favouring times closer to the beginning of the mating season . This is plausible as this allows the most time for the attraction of a mate and the decline in calling to the end of the season is also valid because most organisms will have a mate by then and not have any need to continue such display behaviour. Depending upon the species and evolutionary histories, environmental factors such as temperature, elevation, and precipitation can affect the presence of these behaviours . Along with environmental cues, social cues can also play a role in the demonstration of display behaviour. For example, aggressive display behaviour in the crayfish \"Orconectes virilistends\" to be triggered by impositions of other crayfish on previously established territory . Such displays consist of a preliminary raising of claws between 4 to 5 times and if this is not sufficient to warn the other to not encroach on the territory then tactile engagement will occur. In this case, display behaviour is a preliminary step to the engagement of aggressive tactile behaviour whereas many cases of display behaviour result in the engagement of mating rituals.\n\n[3] Display (zoology): Birds also very commonly use display behaviours for courtship and communication. Manakin birds (in the family Pipridae) in the Amazon undergo large demonstrations of display behaviour in order to court females in the population . Since males provide no other immediate benefit to females, they must undergo ritualized behaviours in order to show their fitness to possible mates; the female then uses the information she gathers from this interaction to make a decision on who she will mate with . This display behaviour consists of various flight patterns, wing and colour displays, and particular vocalizations  . As a result of this performance, the males will be chosen by the female and reproduction will commence.\n\n[4] Display (zoology): Along with invertebrates and birds, vertebrates like the harbour seal also show display behaviour. Since the harbour seal resides in an aquatic environment, the display behaviours expressed are slightly different from those seen in terrestrial mammal species . Male harbour seals show specific vocalization and diving behaviours while demonstrating such behaviours for possible mates . As seals are distributed over such a large area, these display behaviours can slightly change geographically as males try to appeal to the largest number of females possible over a large geographical range. Dive displays, head flicks, and various vocalizations all work together in a display behaviour that signifies to the females in a colony that the males are ready to mate .\n\n[5] Agonistic behaviour: Threat behaviour is any behaviour that signifies hostility or intent to attack another animal. Threat behaviour is meant to cause the opponent to back down and leave. While ritual display can be used for an array of reasons or communicative purposes, threat distinctly is meant for hostility and is the last step before fighting or submission. Threat does not involve physical contact with another animal. Any threat behaviour most often elicits other agonistic behaviour in the recipient. This initiation of threat will result in a display of physical attributes, a fight, or submission; the behaviour or sequence of behaviours depends on what resources are being fought over and each individual’s chance of winning against his opponent. In any animal species, threat always contains components of attack and fleeing, which expresses an animal’s readiness and likelihood of winning. An intimidation display with a means to threat are exhibited through: hair bristling, feather ruffling, raising skin folds and crest, teeth displaying, horn displaying, making sound, etc.\n\n[6] Agonistic behaviour: For animals, display is any behaviour modified by evolution that is used to convey information. Animals display particular signs, which recipients can use to infer something about the mental and physical state of the first animal.  To avoid the heavy cost of fighting, animals have evolved sophisticated rituals, which they use to bluff their opponents into backing down or fleeing. The cost-benefit model of display makes three assumptions: (1) type of display varies depending on the cost; (2) the risk of the display increases as the effectiveness of display increases; and (3) the value of resource being disputed over determines the choice of display used. Animals have evolved to use their physical attributes as a display of ability. If contests can be resolved with ritual display, fighting is not needed. Display can be used to dispute for mates, territory, and food through symbolic gestures instead of battles to the death. If an animal can display without fighting that he is more physically fit than his opponent, he will have gained more than he would have if he had fought and in the process possibly been injured.\n\n[7] Zoo: Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their behavioural repertoire. These are usually indicative of stress. For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers. Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.\n\n[8] Display (zoology): Communication is very important for animals all throughout the animal kingdom, even those with fairly simple nervous systems and body plans. For example, since female praying mantids are sexually cannibalistic, the male will typically avail of a concealment form of display behaviour. This is a series of creeping movements executed by the male as it approaches the female with freezing of the body whenever the female looks towards the male. However, according to laboratory studies conducted by Loxton in 1979, one type of praying mantis, \"Ephestiasula arnoena\", shows both male and female counterparts performing overt and ritualized behaviour before mating. Both displayed a semaphore behaviour, meaning both displayed their front legs in a boxing fashion before the slow approach of the male from behind . This semaphore display in \"E. arnoenais\"key in communicating between both mantids that both are ready for copulation and, by extension, the continuance of their genetic line.\n\n[9] Deception in animals: A deimatic displays is a pattern of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, such as those of genus \"Speiredonia\", or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus \"Spirama\". Adult Atlas moths of the genera \"Attacus\" and \"Rothschildia\" also display snake heads. The eyed hawkmoth displays its large eyespots on its wings and moves them slowly as if it were a vertebrate predator such as an owl.\n\n[10] Deimatic behaviour: Deimatic behaviour or startle display means any pattern of bluffing behaviour in an animal that lacks strong defences, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. The term deimatic or dymantic originates from the Greek δειματόω (deimatόo), meaning \"to frighten\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is described as submarine inflow of fresh-, and brackish groundwater from land into the sea. Submarine Groundwater Discharge is controlled by several forcing mechanisms, which cause a hydraulic gradient between land and sea. Considering the different regional settings the discharge occurs either as (1) a focused flow along fractures in karst and rocky areas, (2) a dispersed flow in soft sediments, or (3) a recirculation of seawater within marine sediments. Submarine Groundwater Discharge plays an important role in coastal biogeochemical processes and hydrological cycles such as the formation of offshore plankton blooms, hydrological cycles, and the release of nutrients, trace elements and gases.\n\n[2] Submarine groundwater discharge: The first study which detected and quantified Submarine Groundwater Discharge on a regional basis was done by Moore (1996) in the South Atlantic Bight off South Carolina. He measured enhanced radium-226 concentrations within the water column near shore and up to about from the shoreline. Radium-226 is a decay product of thorium-230, which is produced within sediments and supplied by rivers. However, these sources could not explain the high concentrations present in the study area. Moore (1996) hypothesized that submarine groundwater, enriched in radium-226, was responsible for the high concentrations. This hypothesis has been tested numerous times at sites around the world and confirmed at each site.\n\n[3] Submarine groundwater discharge: The first study about Submarine Groundwater Discharge was done by Sonrel (1868) who speculated on the risk of submarine springs for sailors. However until the mid-1990s SGD remained rather unrecognized by the scientific community because it was hard to detect and measure the freshwater discharge. The first elaborated method to study SGD was done by Moore (1996)who used radium-226 as a tracer for groundwater. Since then several methods and instruments were developed to attempt to detect and quantify discharge rates.\n\n[4] Submarine groundwater discharge: In coastal areas the groundwater and seawater flows are driven by a variety of factors. Both types of water can circulate in marine sediments due to tidal pumping, waves, bottom currents or density driven transport processes. Meteoric freshwaters can discharge along confined and unconfined aquifers into the sea or the oppositional process of seawater intruding into groundwater charged aquifers can take place. The flow of both fresh and sea water is primarily controlled by the hydraulic gradients between land and sea and differences in the densities between both waters and the permeabilities of the sediments.\n\n[5] Submarine groundwater discharge: According to Schlüter et al. (2004) chloride pore water profiles can be used to investigate submarine groundwater discharge. Chloride can be used as a conservative tracer, as it is enriched in seawater and depleted in groundwater. Three different shapes of chloride pore water profiles reflect three different transport modes within marine sediments. A chloride profile showing constant concentrations with depth indicates that no submarine groundwater is present A chloride profile with a linear decline indicates a diffusive mixing between groundwater and seawater and a concave shaped chloride profile represents an advective admixture of submarine groundwater from below.\n\n[6] Submarine groundwater discharge: Lee (1977) designed a seepage meter, which consists of a chamber which is connected to a sampling port and a plastic bag. The chamber is inserted into the sediment and water discharging through the sediments is caught within the plastic bag. The change in volume of water which is caught in the plastic bag over time represents the freshwater flux.\n\n[7] Groundwater: Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from and eventually flows to the surface naturally; natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.\n\n[8] Groundwater flow: In hydrogeology, groundwater flow is defined as the \"...part of streamflow that has infiltrated the ground, has entered the phreatic zone, and has been discharged into a stream channel, or springs and seepage water.\" It is governed by the groundwater flow equation. Groundwater is water that is found underground in cracks and spaces in the soil, sand and rocks. An area where water fills these spaces is called a phreatic zone or saturated zone. Groundwater is stored in and moves slowly through the layers of soil, sand and rocks called aquifers. The rate of groundwater flow depends on the permeability (the size of the spaces in the soil or rocks and how well the spaces are connected) and the hydraulic head (water pressure).\n\n[9] Submarine groundwater discharge: With Kf being the hydraulic conductivity, m the aquifer thickness and Q the discharge rate. Assuming an isotropic aquifer system the length of a salt wedge solely depends on the hydraulic conductivity, the aquifer thickness and is inversely related to the discharge rate. These assumptions are only valid under hydrostatic conditions in the aquifer system. In general the interface between fresh and saline water forms a zone of transition due to diffusion/dispersion or local anisotropy.\n\n[10] Spring (hydrology): Still other springs are the result of pressure from an underground source in the earth, in the form of volcanic activity. The result can be water at elevated temperature such as a hot spring. The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable bedrock such as limestone and dolomite, creating vast cave systems.Spring discharge, or resurgence, is determined by the spring's recharge basin. Factors that affect the recharge include the size of the area in which groundwater is captured, the amount of precipitation, the size of capture points, and the size of the spring outlet. Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and losing streams. In some cases entire creeks seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. Grand Gulf State Park in Missouri is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system. The water emerges away, forming some of the discharge of Mammoth Spring in Arkansas. Human activity may also affect a spring's discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, twin interior chimneys, and clapboard siding. Its main entrance is sheltered by a gable-roofed portico. The oldest portion of the house, its front right, dates to about 1722, with the front rooms on the left added soon afterward. In the 19th century the rear of the house was either rebuilt or enlarged to be a full two stories in height, and the house was given a modest Greek Revival stylistic treatment.\n\n[2] Sidney White House: Sidney White House is a historic home located at Preston Hollow in Albany County, New York. It was built about 1841 and consists of a main block with addition. The main block is a five bay, two story gable ended building with a medium pitched roof. The addition, originally a wood shed, is one and one half stories in height with a medium pitched roof. It is of heavy timber frame construction on a rubblestone foundation. Interior treatments are Greek Revival in style.\n\n[3] Preston House (Salem, Virginia): Preston House, also known as the John Cole House and Johns(t)on House, is a historic home located at Salem, Virginia. It was built about 1821, and is a two-story, five bay, Federal style brick I-house dwelling. It features a single pile, central passage plan and original rear ell, its exterior end chimneys and decorative brick cornices.\n\n[4] Elizabeth Blair Lee: She was born in Kentucky to Francis Preston Blair and Eliza Violet Gist Blair. She was the sister of Montgomery Blair, James Blair, and Francis Preston Blair, Jr. When the family moved to Blair House across the street from the White House, the President, Vice-President and Cabinet members were frequent guests. Elizabeth's best friend was President Andrew Jackson's young niece, Emily Donelson, who served as First Lady for her uncle, whose wife had died. Elizabeth lived in the White House one winter because of her health problems from dampness at Blair House. According to one version of the story, Elizabeth was present with her father when they chanced upon the silver-flecked spring which would inspire the name of the family's summer home in what would eventually become Silver Spring, Maryland. The spring site is memorialized at Silver Spring's Acorn Park though the water source was disrupted in the 1950s.\n\n[5] Hampton–Preston House: The house is of a post-Colonial, Classical Revival style, having a broad veranda across the front with Doric columns and a fanlight above. Inside is a sweeping circular stairway with mahogany rails. A crystal chandelier hangs in the middle of the hall. The rooms are spacious, and one is adorned with a white marble mantel by the sculptor Hiram Powers. The gardens covered a city block and were known throughout the state, but they have been plowed under and felled, eventually becoming a parking lot.\n\n[6] Preston on the Hill: Preston on the Hill is a rural village in the ceremonial county of Cheshire. It is located between the villages of Daresbury, Dutton and Preston Brook. The village comprises the hamlets of Windmill Lane, Waterfront, Cotton's Bridge, Tunnel End North, Tunnel Top and Barker's Hollow as well as several farms including White House, Little Manor, New Manor and Humble Bee House.  The name PRESTON means \"priest's house or priest's farm\".\n\n[7] Preston Manor, Brighton: Preston Manor is a two-storey building with a symmetrical Palladian/Georgian façade, now clad in stucco, and a roof laid with Welsh slates. The design is characteristic of the mid-18th century, when such symmetrical compositions were fashionable. More space is provided by the basement (in which the remains of the medieval manor house are visible) and the attic, which has dormer windows. The entrance is on the north side and has a five-window range on the main façade. Its east and west wings, added in the 1738 rebuilding, have windows at ground-floor level only (except for a single first-floor window on the east side), and Charles Stanley Peach's additions of 1905 have two- and three-window ranges. All windows retain their original sashes and louvre-style shutters. The hipped roof, with a centrally placed chimney, sits behind a parapet; the side wings have similar roofs. A parapet continues around the roof of the south façade, which has several chimneys at the sides.\n\n[8] John Preston (priest): Preston, however, could not draw the puritans to the side of Buckingham, whom they profoundly distrusted. Preston's friends urged the necessity of a conference on Montagu's books, and nominated on the one side John Buckeridge, Bishop of Rochester, and Francis White, then dean of Carlisle; on the other, Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and Preston. Buckingham played a double part, begging Preston as his friend to decline the conference, and letting others know that he had done with Preston. The conference was held in February 1626 at York House. Preston refused to take part, but came in after it was begun and sat by as a hearer. A second conference followed in the same month, at which Preston took the lead against Montagu and White.\n\n[9] Preston House (Saltville, Virginia): The Preston House, also known as the Palmer House, was a historic home located at Saltville, Smyth County, Virginia. The original section was built about 1795. It was a two-story, gable-roofed, double-pile frame structure covered with beaded weatherboard. It consisted of a two-story, five bay center section flanked by later, and lower, two-story, three bay flanking wings. The house was built by lawyer and politician Francis Preston (1765–1836), whose family owned the salt works. The house was destroyed in 1978.\n\n[10] Preston Hall, Preston-on-Tees: Preston Hall is an early 19th century mansion house at Preston-on-Tees, Stockton-on-Tees, England. It has been a museum since 1953 and is owned by Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council. It is a listed building. The house stands in of parkland. The grounds of the house form Preston Park.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

There are many fields such as podiatric nurse\n\n[3] Podiatrist: In the UK, podiatrists usually undertake a 3-year undergraduate Bachelor of Science (Podiatry). Podiatric Surgeons have undertaken fellowships and postgraduate training. The scope of practice of a podiatrist falls into four key categories: General clinics, Biomechanics, High risk patient management and Surgery. There are two levels of surgical practice. As part of general podiatric care, podiatrists as HPC (Health Professions Council) registered practitioners are involved with nail and minor soft tissue surgical procedures and qualified to administer local anaesthetics. From 1 August 2012, the HPC is being rebranded to the HCPC (Health & Care Professions Council) as they are expanding their remit to include Social Workers. The old term of \"State Registered\" has been defunct for some time and is no longer used since the creation of the HPC. Some podiatrists go on to develop and train as podiatric surgeons, who surgically manage bone and joint disorders within the foot. It is to this latter group (Podiatric Surgeons) that the guidelines apply. Fellowship requires a minimum of six years postgraduate training. This includes a two or three year surgical residency with an approved centre. Podiatric surgeons acquire comprehensive knowledge of related subjects including pharmacology, regional anaesthetic techniques and radiographic interpretation, as well as in-depth knowledge of foot surgery. The surgical faculty of the College of Podiatrists has set the standards for fellowship.\n\n[4] Podiatrist: Worldwide, in many countries the term \"podiatrist \"refers to allied health professionals who specialize in the treatment of the lower extremity, particularly the foot. Podiatrists in these countries are specialists in the diagnosis and treatment of foot pathology, but not through surgical means. In some circumstances these practitioners will further specialise and, following further training, perform reconstructive foot and ankle surgery.\n\n[5] Podiatrist: Australian podiatrists complete an undergraduate degree of Bachelor of Podiatry or Podiatric Medicine ranging from 3 to 4 years of education. The first 2 years of this program are generally focused on various biomedical science subjects including anatomy, medical chemistry, biochemistry, physiology, pathophysiology, sociology and patient psychology, similar to the medical curriculum. The following two years will then be spent focusing on podiatry specific areas such as podiatric biomechanics and human gait, podiatric orthopaedics or the non-surgical management of foot abnormalities, pharmacology & prescribing, general medicine, general pathology, local and general anaesthesia, and surgical procedural techniques such as partial and total nail avulsions, matricectomy, cryotherapy, wound debridement and care, enucleation, and other cutaneous and electro-surgical procedures such as electro-desiccation, fulagaration and electrosection. Postgraduate courses in podiatric therapeutics and prescribing are required for having endorsements in scheduled medicines. All podiatrists are required to register with AHPRA prior to be licensed to practice in Australia. Registration is required annually. There is a minimum of continuing professional development (CPD) hours a podiatrist must undertake to maintain said registration. Podiatric surgeons are specialist podiatrists who have completed extensive, post graduate medical and surgical training and perform reconstructive surgery of the foot and ankle. The qualifications of podiatric surgeons are recognised by Australian State and Federal Governments. It is an approved specialty by the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation Agency. Podiatric surgeons are included within both the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act.\n\n[6] Podiatrist: A podiatrist, also known as a podiatric physician (/poʊˈdaɪətrɪst/ poh-dye-eh-trist) or \"foot and ankle surgeon\", is a medical professional devoted to the study and medical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle and lower extremity. The term originated in North America, but has now become the accepted term in the English-speaking world for all practitioners of podiatric medicine.\n\n[7] Podiatry: While the majority of podiatric physicians are in solo practice, there has been a movement toward larger group practices as well as the use of podiatrists in multi-specialty groups including orthopedic groups, treating diabetes, or in multi-specialty orthopedic surgical groups. Some podiatrists work within clinic practices such as the Indian Health Service (IHS), the Rural Health Centers (RHC) and Community Health Center (FQHC) systems established by the US government to provide services to under-insured and non-insured patients as well as within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs providing care to veterans of military service.\n\n[8] Occupational therapist: Occupational Therapy also plays a major role in the rehabilitation and recovery of patients who have hand as well and upper and lower extremity injuries. They play a significant role in liaising with Hand Surgeon/Orthopeadic Surgeon and patients employers or case managers in providing the best client centered rehabilitation program. Occupational Therapist treats conditions ranging from soft tissue injuries such as Tennis Elbows to nerve neuropathies such as Cubital Tunnel Syndrome/ Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. An Array of Upper Limb assessment are utilised to provide a treatment care that is effective and appropriate. Treatment modalities such as orthosis/splints, soft braces and education are some of the common treatment tool that an occupational therapist will use during treatment. Hand Therapy is a specialised field of occupational therapy and it requires therapist to be highly skilled and knowledgeable in upper limb anatomy to be able to work in this area. It is definitely an area where Occupational Therapy is famous for due to the therapeutic models that the profession practices which focus on occupation as means and ends and their aim of returning patients to them performing their daily functions.\n\n[9] Podiatry: In a similar way to podiatrists in Australasia, UK podiatrists may continue their studies and qualify as podiatric surgeons. Due to recent changes in legislation, the professional titles ‘chiropodist’ and ‘podiatrist’ are now protected by law. In the UK there is no difference between the terms chiropodist and podiatrist. Those using protected titles must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). Registration is normally only granted to those holding a bachelor's degree from one of 13 recognized schools of podiatry in the UK. Professional bodies recognised by the Health Professions Council are: The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, The Alliance of Private Sector Practitioners (thealliancepsp.com ), The Institute of Chiropodists and Podiatrists and The British Chiropody and Podiatry Association.\n\n[10] Forensic podiatry: The evidential materials that would be considered by forensic podiatrists can sometimes fall within the specialist understanding of other disciplines. For example, forensic gait analysis case work has been undertaken by human movement scientists and the knowledge involved in forensic gait analysis is that possessed by some physical therapists and orthopedic specialists as well as podiatrists (DiMaggio and Vernon, 2017).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is native to the Indian subcontinent where it is indigenous. Hundreds of cultivated varieties have been introduced to other warm regions of the world. It is a large fruit-tree, capable of a growing to a height and crown width of about and trunk circumference of more than . The species domestication is attributed to India around 2000 BCE. Mango was brought to East Asia around 400-500 BCE, in the 15th century to the Philippines, and in the 16th century to Africa and Brazil by Portuguese explorers. The species was assessed and first named in botanical nomenclature by Linnaeus in 1753. Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines and the national tree of Bangladesh.\n\n[2] Mangifera: \"Mangifera\" species are widely cultivated in Asia and elsewhere. More than 27 species in the genus bear edible, fleshy fruits, especially the Common Mango (\"M. indica\"). Others, such as \"M. foetida\", yield astringent fruits that can be eaten pickled.\n\n[3] Mangifera: Mangifera is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. It contains approximately 69 species, with the best-known being the Common Mango (\"Mangifera indica\"). The center of diversity is in subtropical and tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia, while the highest number of species occur in India. They are generally canopy trees in lowland rainforests, reaching a height of .\n\n[4] Mango: The majority of these species are found in nature as wild mangoes. The genus belongs to the cashew family Anacardiaceae. Mangoes are native to South Asia, from where the \"common mango\" or \"Indian mango\", \"Mangifera indica\", has been distributed worldwide to become one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the tropics. Other \"Mangifera\" species (e.g. horse mango, \"Mangifera foetida\") are grown on a more localized basis.\n\n[5] Deanolis sublimbalis: The larvae are a serious pest of \"Mangifera indica\" fruit, but have also been recorded feeding on \"Mangifera minor\" and \"Mangifera odorata\". They hatch and burrow into the distal end of the mango fruit. Larvae pass through five instars within the fruit, with a larval development period of 14 to 20 days. Early instars feed on the fruit pulp forming a network of tunnels which may eventually cause the fruit to collapse. Later instars feed on the seed. Up to eleven larvae have been found in a single fruit, but there is mostly only one larva in a single fruit.\n\n[6] Sternochetus mangiferae: Mangoes (\"Mangifera indica\") originated in Myanmar and north-east India and this is probably where \"S. mangiferae\" originated. This species is distributed in nearly all of the world's mango-growing regions; Australasia and Oceania, Asia, Africa, North America (Hawaii), Caribbean, South America (French Guiana and Brazil).\n\n[7] Mangifera pajang: Mangifera pajang is a species of plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is found only in Borneo, which comprises the Brunei sultanate, Kalimantan province of Indonesia, and the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The fruit is known in Borneo with its native name, \"Bambangan\".\n\n[8] Mangifera sylvatica: Mangifera sylvatica, also known as the Himalayan mango, pickling mango, or Nepal mango, is a species of plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is found in Bangladesh, Cambodia, China (Yunnan), India (Assam, Darjeeling, Sikkim), Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and Thailand. It is a tree tall. The fruit measure .\n\n[9] Mandragora officinarum: \"Mandragora officinarum\" was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the first edition of \"Species Plantarum\". It is the type species of the genus \"Mandragora\". (Linnaeus later changed his mind and in 1759 placed \"M. officinarum\" in the genus \"Atropa\" as \"A. mandragora\".) Linnaeus regarded \"M. officinarum\" as the sole species in the genus, at that time only known from the Mediterranean region. Jackson and Berry (1979) and Ungricht et al. (1998) have documented some of the subsequent confusion over the number of Mediterranean species of \"Mandragora\" and their scientific names. Ungricht et al. describe the confusion as \"incredible\" and a \"morass\".\n\n[10] Mandragora (genus): Jackson and Berry (1979) and Ungricht et al. (1998) have documented the subsequent confusion over the number of Mediterranean species of \"Mandragora\" and their scientific names. Dioscorides was among those who distinguished between \"male\" and \"female\" mandrakes, a distinction used in 1764 when Garsault published the names \"Mandragora mas\" and \"Mandragora foemina\". The size and shape of the fruit and the colour and time of appearance of the flowers have been used to distinguish possible species. In the 1820s, Antonio Bertoloni used flowering time to name two species as \"Mandragora vernalis\", the spring-flowering mandrake, and \"Mandragora autumnalis\", the autumn-flowering mandrake. Identifying the former as Linnaeus's \"M. officinarum\", works such as \"Flora Europaea\" listed two Mediterranean species of \"Mandragora\": \"M. officinarum\" and \"M. autumnalis\". Using statistical analysis of morphological characters, Ungricht et al. found no distinct clusters among the specimens they examined and concluded that Linnaeus's \"M. officinarum\" is a single, variable species. Other sources divide \"M. officinarum\" sensu lato differently.

The release was much ballyhooed for several reasons. Sheard was only the second gospel artist signed to Elektra Records, and this was her debut for the label. It was also her first release since the success of her Grammy-nominated debut \"Finally Karen\", and a long bout with illness had delayed any releases from her since. The album peaked at #2 on the \"Billboard\" Gospel Charts, #3 on the Billboard Contemporary Christian Charts, #27 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Charts, and #82 on the Billboard 200.\n\n[10] B.O.A.T.S.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhere is the Perry Point Mansion House located?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: The Perry Point Mansion House and grist Mill is a national historic district at Perry Point, Cecil County, Maryland, United States. It is a -story, center-passage brick house covered with gray stucco. The 30 foot by 20 foot, stone grist mill is built into a river bank and is two to three stories high. Both structures were built about 1750. Since the end of World War I when the property was acquired by the Federal government, Perry Point has been used as a rehabilitation center, a supply depot, and a psychiatric hospital, the latter use surviving and expanding to the present\n\n[2] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: In 1728, Perry Point was owned by John Perry, George Perry, Anna Templer and Dorothy Barren. In 1729, Phillip Thomas became the owner of the property, leaving it by will to his son Samuel Thomas in 1763, who in turn willed it to his son Richard Thomas in 1784. It was during the Thomas family ownership of the Point that the Mansion House was constructed around 1750 from bricks brought over as ballast on ships from England. The Grist Mill, which was built around the same period as the Mansion House, indicates that there was a settlement of considerable size on the Point.\n\n[3] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: In 1798, John Homes’ name appears on the records as the owner of Perry Point, followed by Littleton Gale in 1799 and George Gale on October 11, 1800. On October 13, 1800, John Stump purchased Perry Point, which presumably included an estate of approximately 1,800 acres. It was during the residence of John Stump that the British came up the Chesapeake Bay in the War of 1812, burned Havre de Grace, and continued their destruction as far up as Lapidum, where they burned a grist mill owned by John Stump's cousin. They returned down the river and marched to Principio, where they burned the Iron Works. For some unknown reason, they spared the Mansion House and Grist Mill at Perry Point.\n\n[4] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: In 1710, Captain Richard Perry acquired the land. Although the name “Perry Point” has been ascribed to Captain Richard Perry, the original grant to John Bateman refers to the tract as “Perry Point,” thus proving that the change from “Susquehanna Point” occurred earlier than 1658.\n\n[5] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: Soon after the United States entered World War I on April 6, 1917, several representatives of the U.S. Government were sent out from Washington to inspect a number of locations for an ammonium nitrate plan. Because of its favorable location close to transportation facilities, Perry Point was selected. In February 1918, the U.S. Government purchased the 516-acre estate for $150,000 from the Stump heirs.\n\n[6] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: By Act of Congress, Perry Point was turned over to the U.S. Public Health Service on March 3, 1919, for the hospitalization of War Risk beneficiaries and as a storage depot for surplus hospital supplies for the Army. The first hospital building, a two-story structure located in the village, was converted to accommodate 75 patients.\n\n[7] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: On April 7, 1998, a new inpatient mental health care building was dedicated at Perry Point. The new facility (building 364), which was Perry Point's first new inpatient building constructed in over 50 years, was built to offer specialized treatment programs, rehabilitation services and enhanced patient privacy for Veterans in a comfortable, state-of-the-art setting.\n\n[8] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: John Stump died in 1828, leaving Perry Point to his son John Stump II. During the Civil War, the United States Government took over Perry Point for the first time, using it as a training station for cavalry mules. The officers in charge of the project used the Mansion House for their headquarters, sharing it for a time with the Stump family. When the situation became too strained for comfort, John Stump II moved his family to Harford County to live with his sister. Upon their return, they found the Mansion House badly abused and the farm sadly neglected, but many of the former slaves remained voluntarily as hired workers and the usual activities resumed.\n\n[9] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: When the U.S. Public Health Service opened at Perry Point, the facility functioned as a general hospital that provided care for patients with various disabilities. In 1920, the U.S. Public Health Hospital in Cap May, New Jersey closed, the patients were transferred to Perry Point and four more of the buildings in the village were converted for hospital use. It was at this time that Perry Point became a hospital that focused on neuro-psychiatric care.\n\n[10] Perry Point Mansion House and Mill: In 1923, officials at Perry Point decided to adopt the name “Federal Park” to indicate government ownership and operation. Representatives of the Stump family and other leading families in Cecil County petitioned the authorities in Washington, D.C., to restore the original name of the campus due to its historic significance. On June 30, 1924, the Government agreed to the change and “Federal Park” ceased to be and “Perry Point” came into its own again.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the crime of embracery?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Embracery: The false verdict of a jury, whether occasioned by embracery or otherwise, was formerly considered criminal, and jurors were severely punished, being proceeded against by writ of attaint. The Juries Act 1825, in abolishing writs of attaint, made a special exemption as regards jurors guilty of embracery (s.61). Prosecution for the offence has been so extremely rare that when a case occurred in 1891 it was stated that no precedent could be found for the indictment. The defendant was fined £200, afterwards reduced to £100.\n\n[2] Embracery: In English law, it was an offence both at common law and by statute, punishable by fine and imprisonment. As a statutory offence it dates back to 1360. The offence is complete, whether any verdict has been given or not, and whether the verdict is in accordance with the weight of evidence or otherwise. The person making the attempt, and any member of the jury who consents, are equally punishable.\n\n[3] Embracery: The legal term \"embracery\" comes from the Old Fr. \"embraseour\", an embracer, i.e., one who excites or instigates, literally one who sets on fire, from \"embraser\", to kindle a fire. This is unrelated to the common word \"embrace\", i.e., to hold or clasp in the arms, which is from French \"embracer\", from Latin \"bracchia\", arms.\n\n[4] Embracery: Embracery is the attempt to influence a juror corruptly to give his or her verdict in favour of one side or the other in a trial, by promise, persuasions, entreaties, money, entertainments and the like.\n\n[5] Champerty and maintenance: Maintenance and champerty have not been crimes or torts since the passing of the Criminal Law Act 1967, though embracery was a crime until the Bribery Act 2010. However, the 1967 Act stated:\n\n[6] Embracery: In the United States, embracery prosecutions have occurred as recently as 1989, when a county commissioner in Georgia was sentenced to a fine and probation.\n\n[7] Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540: The Maintenance and Embracery Act 1540 (32 Hen 8 c 9) is an Act of the Parliament of England.\n\n[8] False pretenses: The three major theft offences were larceny, embezzlement and false pretences. Larceny was a common law offence (created by judicial action) while embezzlement and false pretences were statutory offences (created by legislative action). Larceny is by far the oldest. The elements of larceny were \"well-settled\" by the thirteenth century. The only other theft offence then existing was cheat which was a misdemeanor. Cheat was a primitive version of the crime of false pretences and involved obtaining property by the use of false weights or measures. In 1541 a statute was enacted by Parliament that made it a misdemeanor to obtain property by a false token or a counterfeit letter \"made in any other man’s name.\" This statute did not cover obtaining property by the use false spoken words. The first \"modern\" false pretence statute was enacted by Parliament in 1757. The statute prohibited obtaining \"money, goods, wares, or merchandise\" by \"false pretence.\" The first general embezzlement statute was enacted by Parliament in 1799.\n\n[9] Sodom and Gomorrah: Other extrabiblical crimes committed by Sodom and Gomorrah included harshly punishing victims for crimes that the perpetrator committed, including forcing an assault victim to pay for the perpetrator's \"bleeding\" and forcing a woman to marry a man who intentionally caused her miscarriage to compensate for the lost child. Because of this, the judges of the two cities were referred to as Shakrai (\"Liar\"), Shakurai (\"Awful Liar\"), Zayyafi (\"Forger\") and Mazle Dina (\"Perverter of Justice\"). The citizens regularly engaged in the torture of foreigners who sought lodging. They did this by providing the foreigners a standard-sized beds and if they saw that the foreigner was too short for the bed, they would forcibly stretch their limbs but if the foreigner was too tall, they would cut off their legs. According to the Book of Jasher, Paltith, one of Lot's daughters, was burnt alive (in some versions, on a pyre) for giving a poor man bread. Another woman was similarly executed in Admah for giving a traveler, who intended to leave the town the next day, water. When the scandal was revealed, the woman was stripped naked and covered with honey as she was slowly stung to death by bees. Her cries reportedly went up into the heavens, the turning point that was revealed to have provoked God to enact judgement upon Sodom and Gomorrah in the first place.\n\n[10] Molly house: Before 1533, the \"unnatural sin\" (also defined \"detestable crime\" in trial records) of sodomy or \"buggery\", (a specific common law offence, meaning anal intercourse between a man and another man or woman, or anal or vaginal intercourse with a beast – in this way encompassing both sodomy and bestiality) was dealt with by the ecclesiastical courts. From that year however, the country's first civil sodomy law was introduced as \"An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie\" (Buggery Act 1533), and also criminal courts could prosecute individuals accused of such \"crime\". According to the Old Bailey Online Proceedings site:In order to obtain a conviction, it was necessary to prove that both penetration and ejaculation had occurred, and two witnesses were required to prove the crime. Both the \"active\" and \"passive\" partner could be found guilty of this offence. But due to the difficulty of proving this actual penetration and ejaculation many men were prosecuted with the reduced charge of assault with sodomitical intent.From the late 1690s to the early 1710s, the Societies for the Reformation of Manners (organizations born after the Revolution in 1688, seeking to eliminate immorality and disrespect for religion from public life) actively pursued prostitutes, Sabbath breakers and also homosexual men, through the means of spies and \"provocateurs\" to dismantle molly houses and prosecute individuals. In the 1720s and 30s thief-takers like Charles Hitchen and Jonathan Wild stimulated the Societies' activities. The peak of this wave of prosecution is to be recognized in the late 1720s with a raid on the most famous molly house, Mother Clap's.

For the Armv7-A code, these include TI's OMAP 3 and OMAP 4, Samsung's Exynos, and ST-Ericsson's NovaThor U8500. For development on platforms prior to silicon availability, e.g. big.LITTLE development starting at the end of 2011 and Armv8-A work begun in 2012.\n\n[4] Linaro: Linaro is an engineering organization that works on free and open-source software such as the Linux kernel, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), power management, graphics and multimedia interfaces for the Arm family of instruction sets and implementations thereof as well as for the Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA). The founding of Linaro was announced at Computex in June 2010 by Arm, Freescale Semiconductor, IBM, Samsung, ST-Ericsson, and Texas Instruments in a joint press conference. It also provides engineering and investment in upstream open source projects, a monthly release of tools and software and support to silicon companies in upstreaming code to be used with their system-on-a-chips (SoC). At some point Linaro joined the HSA Foundation.\n\n[5] Linaro: The Linaro Enterprise Group (LEG) focuses on Linux development for Arm servers. The Enterprise Group is made up of the following companies: AMD, AppliedMicro, Arm, Broadcom, Cavium, Citrix, Facebook, HiSilicon, HP, QuIC, Red Hat and ZTE. The team's mission is to bring competing companies together to work on common solutions to problems and enable OEM's, commercial Linux providers and System on Chip (SOC) vendors to collaborate in a neutral environment on the development of the core software needed by the rapidly emerging market for low-power hyperscale servers.\n\n[6] Lineo: This combination of technologies allowed Caldera Thin Clients to offer a full Linux operating system with a graphical browser that could run off a floppy disk. More importantly the product was unique, and this came from the fact that Lineo's view on the Linux embedded market was different from other vendors. All the other vendors believed that Linux was heavily fragmented and that the solution was to offer Linux features for real time OSes, that is a Linux API for some other OSes. Red Hat with its EL/IX created a kernel independent framework (API) which allowed some Linux software to run on the eCos kernel. Lineo did not agree with this assessment and believed the API offered far more advantages and allowed for a fully hardened system, that is, Lineo utilized a custom Linux kernel. Through the six companies Lineo acquired, they were able to extend the same Linux technology across multiple chip architectures and add real-time capabilities. The acquisitions gave broader Linux support, from very small microcontrollers, through traditional platforms like x86, and up to high end, high availability systems.\n\n[7] Linaro: At the end of each month there is a release of tools and software that acts as a staging tree for code that will be pushed upstream. Linaro works on software that is close to the silicon such as kernel, multimedia, power management, graphics and security. Linaro aims to provide stable, tested tools and code for multiple software distributions to use to reduce low-level fragmentation of embedded Linux software.\n\n[8] Linaro: Linaro focuses on the use of the Arm instruction set in its versions 7a (32-bit) and 8 (64-bit) including concrete implementations of these, such as SoCs that contain Cortex-A5, Cortex-A7, Cortex-A8, Cortex-A9, Cortex-A15, Cortex-A53 or Cortex-A57 processor(s). Linaro engineering works with upstream projects on a set of requirements that are determined by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).\n\n[9] Linaro: The group includes the automated testing system called LAVA (Linaro Automated Validation Architecture) that Linaro developed. LAVA is for automated testing of the open source components that are used in the major Linux-based software platforms. A lab running LAVA and a wide variety of Arm hardware is run for the use of Linaro and member company engineers.\n\n[10] Linaro: There are currently three published 96Boards specifications for low-cost Armv7-A and Armv8-A development boards:In September 2016 Linaro announced the Linaro IoT and Embedded Group (LITE) that will focus on delivering end to end open source reference software for more secure connected products, ranging from sensors and connected controllers to smart devices and gateways, for the industrial and consumer markets.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was founded in 1815 as Jacksonville. Pickerington was known as Jacksonville until 1827, when the citizens petitioned the state legislature to change the name to Pickerington in honor of its founder, Abraham Pickering. It is a suburb of Columbus. The population was 18,291 at the 2010 census. As land annexation, development, and immigration into the Columbus area continues, the city of Pickerington (like many area suburbs) has generally followed suit. Pickerington is also home to the Motorcycle Hall of Fame, located at 13515 Yarmouth Dr. off Interstate 70.\n\n[2] Pickerington High School Central: Pickerington High School Central is a public high school in Pickerington, Ohio. It is one of two high schools in the Pickerington Local School District. Their nickname is the Tigers. The school is called Central by most and is the oldest of the two high schools. Prior to the opening of Pickerington High School North, it was known simply as \"Pickerington High School\". Pickerington High School Central was known as Violet Township High School from 1906 to 1939 and as Pickerington High School from 1940 to 2002 before being renamed as its current title as Pickerington High School Central. Before that time there were many schools in the Pickerington/Violet Township area, including the Pickerington School (c.1883), a two-story, two room school that was built to replace the original building, which now houses Heritage Elementary. The building that currently houses Pickerington High School Central completed construction in the fall of 1991.\n\n[3] Pickerington, Ohio: The Ohio Secretary of State certified Pickerington as a city in 1991 and it was designated as the \"Violet Capital of Ohio\" in 1996 by the Ohio Legislature. At , Pickerington is the second-largest city in Fairfield County behind Lancaster. Pickerington is located just east of Columbus. The city features a historic downtown shopping area, while Violet Township is home to rolling hills, long horses, forests, and fields.\n\n[4] Pickering Phipps: Pickering III (1861–1937) became a director of the company in 1886. In 1888, the company built new offices at 8 Gold Street, Northampton. In 1891, the Church of St Matthew in Kettering Road, Northampton was built and paid for by the family in memory of Phipps II. This area of the town southeast of Kettering Road, known as \"Phippsville\" was built in the 1880s as a spacious, well-to-do suburb of the town. The large houses are now mostly converted into individual flats. Pickering IIIrd's Northampton home on Cliftonville Road is now the head offices and showroom of the Jeffery-West shoe company. He was High Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1897. He sold the Collingtree Grange Estate to the Sears family in 1913.\n\n[5] Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington: Peter Alexander Rupert Carington, 6th Baron Carrington, (6 June 1919 – 9 July 2018) was a British Conservative politician and hereditary peer who served as Defence Secretary from 1970 to 1974, Foreign Secretary from 1979 to 1982, chairman of British General Electric Company from 1983 to 1984, and Secretary General of NATO from 1984 to 1988. Before his death in 2018, he was the last surviving member of the 1951–55 government of Winston Churchill, the Eden government, and the Macmillan government, as well as of the cabinets of Alec Douglas-Home and Edward Heath. Following the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Carrington was created a life peer as Baron Carington of Upton.\n\n[6] Pickerington High School Central: The Battle of 256: Pickerington High School (Central) and Reynoldsburg High School have one of the longest continuing rivalries in Central Ohio. The schools have faced off in football every year since 1981. The Tigers have won 14 of the last 14 games. In 2005, sponsored by the local Wal-Mart, the Reynoldsburg/Pickerington game became known as the \"Battle of 256\", as Pickerington and Reynoldsburg are the largest cities to sit on Ohio State Route 256. A large metal football shaped trophy is awarded to the winning school each year. Reynoldsburg High School has not defeated Pickerington High School (Central) since 2001.\n\n[7] Pickering, North Yorkshire: Pickering is an ancient market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, on the border of the North York Moors National Park. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it sits at the foot of the moors, overlooking the Vale of Pickering to the south. According to legend the town was founded by King Peredurus around 270 BC; however, the town as it exists today is of medieval origin. The legend has it that the king lost his ring and accused a young maiden of stealing it, but later that day the ring was found in a pike caught in the River Costa for his dinner. The king was so happy to find his ring he married the young maiden; the name Pike-ring changed over the years to Pickering. It is a nice tale told to fit the name, but it is not the origin. Pickering is thought to be named after the followers of an Anglian man named Picer or some such personal name – the Picer-ingas.\n\n[8] Kensington, Philadelphia: Kensington was founded by Anthony Palmer in the early 1730s. Palmer purchased what was called the Fairman Estate, located along the Delaware River in the Northern Liberties Township (area just North of the City of Philadelphia on the Delaware River) The entire estate consisted of 191.5 acres of land, much smaller than the Kensington we know of today. Palmer was an English merchant, who came to Philadelphia at least by 1704, from Barbados. The town of Kensington was named for the area in London known as Kensington, which was recently established as the residency of the British crown. Palmer laid out his town and sold parcels to many of the shipwrights and shipbuilders who were outgrowing their riverfront lots in today's Old City neighborhood, Southwark, and Society Hill areas. He also sold to recent German fishermen immigrants. The original area of Kensington is now more commonly called \"Fishtown\" mainly because of the Shad Fishing that was one of the dominant businesses in Kensington in the 18th and 19th centuries. Anthony Palmer was active in local government and was a member of the Pennsylvania colony's council. As head of council, Palmer became the acting Provincial Governor of Pennsylvania in 1747 and 1748. Palmer died in 1749 and is buried in Christ Church Burial Grounds in Old City section of Philadelphia.\n\n[9] George Pickingill: By this time, Pickingill was increasingly inflating his age, eventually claiming that he was 105 years old. This attracted attention from other areas, including London, and in September 1908 a journalist visited Canewdon; he arrived by automobile, the first that Pickingill had ever seen, and allowed the old man to ride in it. The journalist subsequently wrote an article about the alleged centegenerian, in which he claimed that his name was \"Frederick Pickingale\"; it is possible that Pickingill gave the false name so that no one would be able to look up the parish records and discover his real age. Maple described Pickingill as \"a tall, unkempt man, solitary and uncommunicative. He had very long finger-nails, and kept his money in a purse of sacking\". He also noted that he had worked as a farm labourer and that he was a widower with two sons.\n\n[10] Pickerington High School North: Pickerington High School North is a public high school in Pickerington, Ohio. It is one of two high schools in Pickerington Local School District, the other school being Pickerington High School Central. The school's mascot is the Panthers and its teams take the name \"Panthers.\" The school opened on August 24, 2003.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It occurs most commonly in individuals with Graves' disease, and less commonly in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or in those who are euthyroid.\n\n[2] Signs and symptoms of Graves' disease: Hyperthyroidism almost always causes general eye symptoms like dryness and irritation, regardless of what the cause of the hyperthyroid state is. However, these need to be distinguished from Graves' ophthalmopathy, which can only occur in patients who have Graves' disease. (It may also, rarely, be seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, primary hypothyroidism, and thyroid cancer).\n\n[3] Graves' disease: Graves' disease owes its name to the Irish doctor Robert James Graves, who described a case of goiter with exophthalmos in 1835. Medical eponyms are often styled nonpossessively; thus Graves' disease and Graves disease are variant stylings of the same term.\n\n[4] Graves' disease: Another sign of Graves' disease is hyperthyroidism, \"i.e.\", overproduction of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. Normal thyroid levels are also seen, and occasionally also hypothyroidism, which may assist in causing goiter (though it is not the cause of the Graves' disease). Hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease is confirmed, as with any other cause of hyperthyroidism, by measuring elevated blood levels of free (unbound) T3 and T4.\n\n[5] Thyroid: Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.\n\n[6] Graves' disease: Two signs are truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease (\"i.e.,\" not seen in other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and nonpitting edema (pretibial myxedema). Goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (\"i.e.,\" spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease is the most common cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with computed tomography or ultrasound examination of the thyroid.\n\n[7] Grave (band): Grave is a Swedish death metal band that was formed in 1986 by vocalist and guitarist Ola Lindgren, who is their only constant member. The band had particular success in the early 1990s, and their first four albums, \"Into the Grave\", \"You'll Never See...\", \"Soulless\" and \"Hating Life\", cemented their reputation as one of Sweden's foremost death metal bands. Grave went on hiatus in 1997, but got back together two years later. Since then, they have released seven more albums, making a total of eleven studio albums. Along with Dismember, Entombed and Unleashed, Grave is considered one of the \"big four\" of Swedish death metal.\n\n[8] Graves' disease: Less commonly, it has been known as Parry's disease, Begbie's disease, Flajani's disease, Flajani–Basedow syndrome, and Marsh's disease. These names for the disease were derived from Caleb Hillier Parry, James Begbie, Giuseppe Flajani, and Henry Marsh. Early reports, not widely circulated, of cases of goiter with exophthalmos were published by the Italians Giuseppe Flajani and Antonio Giuseppe Testa, in 1802 and 1810, respectively. Prior to these, Caleb Hillier Parry, a notable provincial physician in England of the late 18th century (and a friend of Edward Miller-Gallus), described a case in 1786. This case was not published until 1825, which was still ten years ahead of Graves.\n\n[9] Gluten-sensitive enteropathy–associated conditions: [Section under construction] Grave's Disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Grave's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are greatly increased in patients with CD. Grave's disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroidism, as GSE is a potentiator for autoimmune disease, but GD is more commonly found and avitaminosis of selenium and other minerals may be a factor in this increase.\n\n[10] Signs and symptoms of Graves' disease: Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders, will experience a worsening of their usual symptoms, as observed by several studies. A study of 1999 found that Graves' disease exacerbated the symptoms of Tourette's disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and points out that the lack of diagnosis of the Graves' disease compromised the efficacy of the treatment of these disorders. Patients who are known to have a convulsive disorder may become more difficult to control with the usual medications, and seizures may appear in patients who have never previously manifested such symptoms.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

There are four main types of courts depending on the materials used for the court surface: clay courts, hard courts, grass courts and carpet courts. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) lists different surfaces and properties and classifies surfaces into one of five pace settings:Of the current four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian and US Open use hard courts, French Open is played on clay, and Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam to have always been played on the same surface, is played on grass. The Australian Open switched from grass to hard courts in 1988 and in its early years the French championship alternated between clay and sand/rubble courts. The US Open is the only major to have been played on three surfaces; it was played on grass from its inception until 1974, clay from 1975 until 1977 and hard courts since it moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the National Tennis Center in 1978.\n\n[2] French Open: The French Open (), also called Roland-Garros (), is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France. The venue is named after the French aviator Roland Garros. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. The French Open is currently the only Grand Slam event held on clay, and it is the zenith of the spring clay court season. Because of the seven rounds needed for a championship, the slow-playing surface and the best-of-five-set men's singles matches (without a tiebreak in the final set), the event is widely considered to be the most physically demanding tennis tournament in the world.\n\n[3] 2012 in tennis: The French Open ( or Tournoi de Roland-Garros, , named after the famous French aviator Roland Garros) is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June in Paris, France, at the Stade Roland Garros. It is the premier clay court tennis tournament in the world and the second of the four annual Grand Slam tournaments – the other three are the Australian Open, US Open and Wimbledon. Roland Garros is the only Grand Slam held on clay and ends the spring clay court season.\n\n[4] 2006 French Open: The 2006 French Open was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France from 28 Mayto 11 June 2006. It was the 110th staging of the French Open, and the second of the four Grand Slam tennis events of 2006. This edition made history as it became the first Grand Slam tournament to start on a Sunday. It was the 2nd time since 1985 that all top 4 seeds reached the semifinals in the men's singles of a Grand Slam tournament. This did not happen again until the same tournament five years later. Both defending champions, Rafael Nadal and Justine Henin-Hardenne, retained their titles.\n\n[5] List of French Open men's singles champions: The French Open is an annual tennis tournament held over two weeks in May and June. Established in 1891 and played since 1928 on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France, the French Open is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments played each year, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open. Organised by the Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), the French Open is the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the year to be played.\n\n[6] Grand Slam (tennis): Eight men have won all four grand slam tournaments. Two of the eight men (Rod Laver and Roy Emerson) achieved a double career Slam. Originally, the grand slams were held on grass (Australian, Wimbledon, and US Open) and clay (French) and the first four players achieved their grand slams on two surfaces. The US Open changed its surface from grass to clay in 1975 and then to hard court in 1978. The Australian Open changed from grass to hard court in 1988. The last four players (Agassi, Federer, Nadal, Djokovic) achieved their career grand slam on three different surfaces: hard court, clay, and grass.\n\n[7] Poaceae: In tennis, grass is grown on very hard-packed soil, and the bounce of a tennis ball may vary depending on the grass's health, how recently it has been mowed, and the wear and tear of recent play. The surface is softer than hard courts and clay (other tennis surfaces), so the ball bounces lower, and players must reach the ball faster resulting in a different style of play which may suit some players more than others. Among the world's most prestigious court for grass tennis is Centre Court at Wimbledon, London which hosts the final of the annual Wimbledon Championships in England, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n[8] Pepsi Grand Slam: The Pepsi Grand Slam was a men's tennis tournament played as part of the Grand Prix circuit from 1976–1981. The tournament was played in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in 1976 and Boca Raton, Florida from 1977–1981. It was held on outdoor clay courts and featured a field of four players, winners of semi-finals played in the final, losers a consolation match.\n\n[9] U.S. Pro Tennis Championships: The tournament was later played on Har-Tru clay courts and was initially an important tune-up event for the U.S. Open. But when this Grand Slam tournament moved to hardcourts in 1978, the U.S. Pro did not follow suit, electing instead to hold its tournament during the U.S. clay court season in early summer instead of during its hitherto pre-Open era (late summer) time slot. Remaining a clay event into the 1990s, the U.S. Pro was a non-ATP exhibition event during the early 1990s. It was only in its final three years that the tournament was once again an ATP event and played on hardcourts.\n\n[10] 1975 US Open (tennis): The 1975 US Open was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor clay courts at the Forest Hills, Queens in New York, United States. The tournament ran from 27 August until 7 September. It was the 95th staging of the US Open, and the fourth Grand Slam tennis event of 1975. During the final three years at the Forest Hills location, 1975-1977, the US Open was played on a green-colored Har-Tru clay surface, a surface slightly harder and faster than red clay. The switch came after player complaints about the poor state and uneven ball bounce on the grass courts of Forrest Hills.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Aristophanes in Plutus makes a remark why victorious athletes are crowned with wreath made of wild olive instead of gold.  Herodotus describes a story that explains why there were only a few Greek men at the Battle of Thermopylae since \"all other men were participating in the Olympic Games\" and that the prize for the winner was \"an olive-wreath\". When Tigranes, an Armenian general learned this, he uttered to his leader: \"Good heavens! what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour\". Hence medals were not awarded at the ancient Olympic Games.\n\n[2] Olympic medal: The olive wreath was the prize for the winner at the Ancient Olympic Games. It was an olive branch, off the wild-olive tree that grew at Olympia, intertwined to form a circle or a horse-shoe. According to Pausanias it was introduced by Heracles as a prize for the winner of the running race to honour Zeus.\n\n[3] Olive wreath: According to Pausanias it was introduced by Heracles as a prize for the running race winner to honor his father Zeus. In the ancient Olympic Games there were no gold, silver, or bronze medals. There was only one winner per event, crowned with an olive wreath made of wild-olive leaves from a sacred tree near the temple of Zeus at Olympia. Olive wreaths were given out during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens in honor of the ancient tradition, because the games were being held in Greece which was also used as the official emblem.\n\n[4] Olympic Games ceremony: Olympic Games ceremonies of the Ancient Olympic Games were an integral part of these Games; the modern Olympic games have opening, closing, and medal ceremonies. Some of the elements of the modern ceremonies harken back to the Ancient Games from which the Modern Olympics draw their ancestry. An example of this is the prominence of Greece in both the opening and closing ceremonies. During the 2004 Games, the medal winners received a crown of olive branches, which was a direct reference to the Ancient Games, in which the victor's prize was an olive wreath. The various elements of the ceremonies are mandated by the Olympic Charter, and cannot be changed by the host nation. This requirement of seeking the approval of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) includes the artistic portion of opening and closing ceremonies.\n\n[5] List of Olympic winners of the Stadion race: The following is a list of winners of the Stadion race at the Olympic Games from 776 BC to 225 AD. It is based on the list given by Eusebius of Caesarea using a compilation by Sextus Julius Africanus. The Stadion race was the first and most important competition of the ancient Olympiads and the names of the winners are used by many Greek authors to date historic events.\n\n[6] Olympic Games: The Ancient Olympic Games were religious and athletic festivals held every four years at the sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia, Greece. Competition was among representatives of several city-states and kingdoms of Ancient Greece. These Games featured mainly athletic but also combat sports such as wrestling and the pankration, horse and chariot racing events. It has been widely written that during the Games, all conflicts among the participating city-states were postponed until the Games were finished. This cessation of hostilities was known as the Olympic peace or truce. This idea is a modern myth because the Greeks never suspended their wars. The truce did allow those religious pilgrims who were travelling to Olympia to pass through warring territories unmolested because they were protected by Zeus. The origin of the Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend; one of the most popular myths identifies Heracles and his father Zeus as the progenitors of the Games. According to legend, it was Heracles who first called the Games \"Olympic\" and established the custom of holding them every four years. The myth continues that after Heracles completed his twelve labours, he built the Olympic Stadium as an honour to Zeus. Following its completion, he walked in a straight line for 200 steps and called this distance a \"stadion\" (, Latin: \"stadium\", \"stage\"), which later became a unit of distance. The most widely accepted inception date for the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC; this is based on inscriptions, found at Olympia, listing the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC. The Ancient Games featured running events, a pentathlon (consisting of a jumping event, discus and javelin throws, a foot race, and wrestling), boxing, wrestling, pankration, and equestrian events. Tradition has it that Coroebus, a cook from the city of Elis, was\n\n[7] Battle of Thermopylae: After the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the Olympic Games. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: \"an olive-wreath\". Upon hearing this, Tigranes, a Persian general, said: \"Good heavens, Mardonius, what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honour!\" (Godley translation) or otherwise, \"Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory.\"\n\n[8] Sport in ancient Greek art: As part of the games taking place at Olympia, many individuals competed in the pentathlon, a competition consisting of five events. The Ancient Olympic Pentathlon consisted of the discus throw, long jumps with weights attached to their feet, javelin throw, running, and wrestling. Many victors of the pentathlon would go on to receive prizes such as exclusive items that were made specifically for the victor. For example, the amphorae of the Panathenaic Games, often filled with expensive olive oil, featured Athena standing with a sword and shield to represent their victory in the games. Because the Olympics were dedicated to Zeus, often these prizes would become votive dedications to him.\n\n[9] Olympic symbols: Herodotus describes the following story which is relevant to the olive wreath. Xerxes was interrogating some Arcadians after the Battle of Thermopylae. He inquired why there were so few Greek men defending Thermopylae. The answer was \"All other men are participating in the Olympic Games\". And when asked \"What is the prize for the winner?\", \"An olive-wreath\" came the answer. Then Tigranes, one of his generals uttered a most noble saying: \"Good heavens! Mardonius, what kind of men are these against whom you have brought us to fight? Men who do not compete for possessions, but for honour.\"\n\n[10] Olympic winners of the Archaic period: Just how far back in history organized athletic contests were held remains a matter of debate, but it is reasonably certain that they occurred in Greece almost 3,000 years ago. However ancient in origin, by the end of the 6th century BC at least four Greek sporting festivals, sometimes called \"classical games,\" had achieved major importance: the Olympic Games, held at Olympia; the Pythian Games at Delphi; the Nemean Games at Nemea; and the Isthmian Games, held near Corinth. The Olympic Games was perhaps the greatest of all sporting event held every four years and all Olympian winners, were highly appreciated among the Greeks.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

This location is in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side. Inspired by Henry Austin Dobson's poem \"Paradox of Time\", and with its 100 figures passing before Father Time, the work was created as a monument to the first 100 years of peace between the United States and the United Kingdom, resulting from the Treaty of Ghent in 1814. Although the fountain's water began running in 1920, the sculpture was not dedicated to the city until 1922. The sculpture is a contributing structure to the Washington Park United States Registered Historic District, which is a National Register of Historic Places listing.\n\n[2] Fountain of Time: \"Time\" commemorates the first 100 years of peace between the United States and Great Britain after the Treaty of Ghent concluded the War of 1812 on December 24, 1814. The design was inspired by the poem \"Paradox of Time\" by Henry Austin Dobson: \"Time goes, you say? Ah no, Alas, time stays, we go\". \"Time\"'s theme has been compared to Shakespeare's All the world's a stage monologue in \"As You Like It\", which describes the seven ages of man: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, old age, and dementia. Taft's figures represent birth, the struggle for existence, love, family life, religion, poetry, and war.\n\n[3] Edwin Dickinson: The dark moodiness of the picture make it clear that the title can only refer to an anniversary of a death, and Driscoll thought it was intended as a memorial to Herbert Groesbeck, the second anniversary of whose death occurred only three weeks after he began the painting—on his own birthday. He believes that the picture's content may have been colored, if not inspired, by Thomas Hardy's poem \"An Anniversary,\" which declares anniversaries to be \"the saddest days of the year\" and by Milton's \"Lycidas\", a poem that Dickinson memorized about this time and often quoted. Milton's subject was the death of a young friend of great promise, as was Dickinson's brother Burgess, and the fear of dying before one's work is done, which Driscoll identifies as also the underlying meaning of Dickinson's painting. The presence of sheet music on the floor and stringed instruments—a violin held by the right hand of the man behind the old man's head and a violin or viola (both of which Dickinson played) held behind his head in the left hand of the standing man—again suggest that Dickinson felt an equivance in the play of forms to musical rhythms and harmonies. The fact that neither the instruments nor the music are used suggests that the music in the painting is expressed through the visual play of form and does not require a representation of playing musicians.\n\n[4] Friedrich Nietzsche: Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in \"The Birth of Tragedy\" was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian \"Kunsttrieben\" (\"artistic impulses\") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of individuality and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.\n\n[5] Mansfield Park: The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) are part of the novel's hidden background. Calvo, quoting Roger Sales, says \"Mansfield Park\" can be read as a Condition-of-England novel that 'debates topical issues such as the conduct of the war and the Regency crisis'. Duckworth believes that Austen took the landscaping symbol from Edmund Burke's influential book, \"Reflections of the Revolution in France (\"1790). Burke distinguished between beneficial \"improvements\" and malign \"innovations\". \"Improvements\" were valued as a part of conservation, but \"innovations\" and \"alterations\" to society were to be abhorred as they led to the destruction of heritage. Duckworth (1994) argues that \"Mansfield Park\" is pivotal to an understanding of Austen's views. Estates, like society, might be in need of improvements, but the changes allegedly advocated by Repton were unacceptable innovations, alterations to the estate that, symbolically, would destroy the entire moral and social heritage. Austen, aware of the fragility of a society uninformed by responsible individual behaviour, is committed to the traditional values of a Christian humanist culture.\n\n[6] Linda Addison (poet): Inspired by transformation, a forced reevaluation of her core belief system following the breakdown of her marriage, like a phoenix Addison created the Bram Stoker Award-winning poetry collection \"Consumed, Reduced to Beautiful Grey Ashes\". Addison was the first African American to win this prestigious award. The first book signing for this collection was held on September 11, 2001, at the Barnes & Noble at Rockefeller Center. The first poem in the collection is entitled \"Fire/Fight,\" although the collection came from Addison's personal journals and reflections previous to the events of 9/11, critics and fans of the book could not help but connect certain themes to current events, like loss, devastation in conjunction with rebirth, rebuilding and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\n[7] Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie: According to critic Harold Bloom, in his analysis of \"Times-Square\", the first line of the fourth stanza (\"I ain't playing dozens mister\") is an allusion to the Dozens, a game in which the participants insult each other. The game is mentioned in later poems, \"The Thirteens (Black)\" and \"The Thirteens (White).\" According to critic Geneva Smitherman, Angelou uses the Thirteens, a twist on the Dozens, to compare the insults of blacks and whites, which allows her to compare the actions of the two races. Bloom compares \"Times-Square\" to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. He suggests that the best way to analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use \"a blues-based model\", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Hagen compares the themes in \"The Thirteens (Black and White)\" with Angelou's poems \"Communication I\" and \"Communication II\", which appear in \"Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well\", her second volume of poetry.\n\n[8] Edison (poem): Edison is an epic poem by Czech poet Vítězslav Nezval. It was written in 1927. Later it was included in the poetic book \"Básně noci\" (\"Poems of the Night\") which was published in 1930. The main hero of the poem is American inventor Thomas Alva Edison, considered by the author to be a modern genius. Nezval's work is a praise of human activity, technology, and science, but also an expression of anxiety about civilisation. Nezval compares the inventor's work to writing poetry. He points out that every creative work demands much toil and courage. After Edison's death in 1931 Nezval wrote \"Signál času\" (\"Signal of time\") which is an elegy. Both poems are written in the same measure, trochaic hexameter. Nezval uses long enumerations, building sophisticated poetical imagery. Nezval's \"Edison\" was probably influenced by Guillaume Apollinaire's work, especially the poem \"Zone\", which was translated into Czech by Karel Čapek.\n\n[9] Paradox (literature): Brooks ends his essay with a reading of John Donne's poem \"The Canonization\", which uses a paradox as its underlying metaphor. Using a charged religious term to describe the speaker's physical love as saintly, Donne effectively argues that in rejecting the material world and withdrawing to a world of each other, the two lovers are appropriate candidates for canonization. This seems to parody both love and religion, but in fact it combines them, pairing unlikely circumstances and demonstrating their resulting complex meaning. Brooks points also to secondary paradoxes in the poem: the simultaneous duality and singleness of love, and the double and contradictory meanings of \"die\" in Metaphysical poetry (used here as both sexual union and literal death). He contends that these several meanings are impossible to convey at the right depth and emotion in any language but that of paradox. A similar paradox is used in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", when Juliet says, \"For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.\"\n\n[10] Thomas Atkinson (divine): Atkinson is not known to have published anything; but he wrote two Latin poems, directed against Andrew Melvin, and styled ‘Andrei Melvini Anti-Tami-Cunicategoria’ and ‘Melvinus delirans’ respectively. A Latin tragedy entitled ‘Homo,’ bearing the signature Thomas Atkinson, may (almost certainly) be ascribed to the same author on these grounds: (1) It was dedicated to Laud in his capacity of president (Præses colendissime), which implies that a member of St John's College wrote it; (2) There was at St John's, during Laud's time, only one Thomas Atkinson of any note as a scholar. The MS. of ‘Homo’ is preserved in the Harleian library of the British Museum, No. 6925.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

ITV introduced \"General Hospital\", which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980, Scottish Television debuted \"Take the High Road\", which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as \"The Sullivans\" (aired on ITV from 1977), \"The Young Doctors\" (from 1982), \"Sons and Daughters\" (from 1983), \"A Country Practice\" (from 1982), \"Richmond Hill\" (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, \"Neighbours\" was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and \"Home and Away\" aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.\n\n[2] Screening of soap operas in Australia: \"Neighbours\" is an Australian soap opera that first aired on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. The first season aired at 5:30 pm in Sydney, at 6:00 pm in Melbourne and Adelaide, and at 7.00 pm in Brisbane. \"Neighbours\" underperformed in Sydney, where it was then moved to a 3.30 pm timeslot. By September 1985, the show was cancelled by Seven after 170 episodes. \"Neighbours\" was then picked up by rival network Ten, where it began screening with episode 171 on 20 January 1986 at 7:00 pm. In March 1992, the show moved to the 6:30 pm timeslot to avoid direct competition from rival soap opera \"Home and Away\" on the Seven Network. In 2011, Ten moved \"Neighbours\" to its digital secondary channel 10 Peach (formerly Eleven), due to poor ratings. The show began screening on 10 Peach on 11 January 2011, the channel's launch day. \"Neighbours\" currently airs at 6:30 pm each weeknight, and is the longest running drama series in Australian television.\n\n[3] Television in Australia: The Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\" was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. The show's storylines concern the domestic and professional lives of the people who live and work in the fictional suburb of Erinsborough, Melbourne. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's other soap opera, \"Sons and Daughters\". \"Neighbours\" underperformed in the Sydney market and it struggled for four months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network, Ten. Ten began screening \"Neighbours\" on 20 January 1986. \"Neighbours\" has since become the longest running series in Australian television and attained great success in the United Kingdom and launched the careers of several international stars, including Kylie Minogue and Guy Pearce.\n\n[4] Neighbours: Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera. It was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed the idea of making a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's shorter-lived soap \"Sons and Daughters\", which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, \"Neighbours\" underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening \"Neighbours\" on 20 January 1986, beginning where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. \"Neighbours\" has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame.\n\n[5] Soap opera: Several Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of \"The Young Doctors\", \"The Sullivans\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Neighbours\" (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's \"Prisoner\" began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. \"Prisoner\" also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated \"Prisoner\" in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of \"Sons and Daughters\". During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\" had resulted in the debuts of \"Taurus Rising\" and \"Return to Eden\", two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.\n\n[6] Soap opera: During the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as \"Neighbours\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as \"Days of Our Lives\", Australia's \"Home and Away\" and Germany's \"Sturm der Liebe\". Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera \"Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden\" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include \"The Young and the Restless\", \"EastEnders\" (both on VTM), \"Port Charles\" (at één, then known as TV1) and \"Coronation Street\" (on Vitaya). \"Santa Barbara\" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.\n\n[7] Richmond Hill (TV series): The UK's ITV network decided to show \"Richmond Hill\" in a daytime Wednesday and Thursday 14.00 slot and its much publicised launch was 5 October 1988. In the wake of the success of \"Neighbours\" on BBC One, ITV decided to network an Australian soap opera for the first time (thereby each episode was shown on the same day and at the same time across the UK) and its launch also caused a small amount of controversy. British television schedules were becoming littered with Australian soaps and dramas, old and new, and the industry began to protest. In October 1988 alone, there were as many as 8 serials from Australia on Britain's two main terrestrial channels; \"Neighbours\" (BBC - from 1986), \"The Flying Doctors\" (BBC - from 1988), \"The Sullivans\" (ITV - from 1977), \"\" (ITV - from 1984), \"The Young Doctors\" (ITV - from 1982), \"A Country Practice\" (ITV - from 1982), \"Carson's Law\" (some ITV regions from 1984) and \"Sons and Daughters\" (ITV - from 1983). There was even a TV programme dedicated to the subject particularly after ITV launched another Australian series, \"Home and Away\" (in February 1989), which ironically had debuted the very same week as \"Richmond Hill\" in Australia on Seven Network. The programme featured Phil Redmond, creator of British soap opera \"Brookside\", who argued that the timeslots occupied by 'cheap' Australian soaps could be filled with innovative British soaps and dramas.\n\n[8] Episode 523 (Neighbours): \"Episode 523\" became one of the most watched soap opera episodes upon its broadcast in Australia. When it aired in Britain in November 1988, it attracted an audience of 19.6 million, making it the third most watched programme in the country that year. The episode was well received by critics and viewers. \"TV Week\"s Kelly Bourne stated that the wedding would be the most exciting television soap opera event of 1987, while Network Ten's head of drama thought it was \"a major turning point for \"Neighbours\"\". The wedding has been voted one of the most memorable soap moments and is often included in lists featuring the greatest television weddings of all time.\n\n[9] Soap opera: After the network cancelled \"Neighbours\", it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences, however after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. In January 2011 it moved to Eleven and is Australia's longest-running soap opera.\n\n[10] Soap opera: Produced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, \"Neighbours\" achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show \"Perfect Match\" on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in \"Neighbours\" as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep \"Neighbours\" on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas \"A Country Practice\" and \"Sons and Daughters\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Located roughly midway between Genoa and Pisa, on the Ligurian Sea, it is one of the main Italian military and commercial harbours and a major Italian Navy base. A significant railway junction, it is notable for its museums, for the Palio del Golfo rowing race, and for railway and boat links with the Cinque Terre.\n\n[2] Port of La Spezia: Port of La Spezia () is a port in La Spezia, Liguria, Italy. The port of La Spezia is one of the largest commercial ports in the Ligurian Sea, and is located in the northernmost part of the Gulf of La Spezia. Its development dates from the late nineteenth century and has since grown to become one of the main ports of the Mediterranean Sea, specializing in container handling in particular. Inside a bay of 1500 hectares protected by a breakwater of about , the port of La Spezia has of quays and at least of space. In 2014, 15,700,000 tonnes and 483,564 passengers passed through the port.\n\n[3] Province of La Spezia: The Province of La Spezia () is a province in the Liguria region of Italy. Its capital is the city of La Spezia.\n\n[4] La Spezia: La Spezia (; in the local Spezzino dialect), at the head of the Gulf of La Spezia in the southern part of the Liguria region of Northern Italy, is the capital city of the province of La Spezia.\n\n[5] Province of La Spezia: In the province of La Spezia are the Cinque Terre, Portovenere and the Islands (Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Also more in this area are the villages of Brugnato, Montemarcello, Tellaro and Varese Ligure, which were included in the list of the most beautiful villages in Italy. In addition, the Province of La Spezia is one of the institutions awarded with the Gold Medal for Military Valour for the sacrifices of its people and its activities in the partisan struggle during the Second World War.\n\n[6] La Spezia: La Spezia and its province have been settled since prehistoric times. In Roman times the most important centre was Luni, not far from Sarzana. As the capital of the short-lived Niccolò Fieschi Signoria in the period between 1256 and 1273, La Spezia was inevitably linked with Genoese vicissitudes. After the fall of the Serene Republic of Genoa, an independent state until 1797, La Spezia grew, developed and changed, though along lines similar to Liguria's capital Genoa. This Ligurian influence can still be seen in the urban layout as well as in the types of buildings and decorations. This is notable in the carrugio, the narrow street that divides the Old Town into two. It is called Via del Prione, taking its name from the \"pietrone\" or large stone, in local dialect prione, where public announcements were once read out.\n\n[7] Province of La Spezia: The Province of La Spezia is very well connected to the whole Italian territory by the Italian Railways. Two main lines cross the territory: the \"Tirrenica\" line linking the province to Genoa and Rome, and the \"Pontremolese\" line that goes in the direction of Parma. There are regular trains that connect the province with the main Italian cities, including: Milan, Turin, Florence, Pisa, Palermo, Reggio Calabria, Naples, Savona and Ventimiglia.\n\n[8] 80th Infantry Division La Spezia: 80th Infantry Division La Spezia was an Airlanding Division of the Italian Army during World War II. The \"La Spezia\" was formed in 1941, for the planned Invasion of Malta. When the invasion was cancelled the Division was instead transferred to Libya in October 1942. In December it was reinforced by a battalion of the San Marco Marines and additional artillery. It suffered heavy losses during the Battle of the Mareth Line in Tunisia in March 1943 and the surviving elements surrendered in May 1943.\n\n[9] La Spezia–Rimini Line: Indeed, the significance of the La Spezia–Rimini Line is often challenged by specialists within both Italian dialectology and Romance dialectology. One reason is that while it demarcates preservation (and expansion) of phonemic geminate consonants (Central and Southern Italy) from their simplification (in Northern Italy, Gaul, and Iberia), the areas affected do not correspond consistently with those defined by voicing criterion. Romanian, which on the basis of lack of voicing is classified with Central and Southern Italian, has undergone simplification of geminates, a defining characteristic of Western Romance.Note that, up to , the word \"Lombard\" meant \"Cisalpine\", but now it has narrowed in its meaning, referring only to the administrative region of Lombardy .\n\n[10] La Spezia–Rimini Line: The La Spezia–Rimini Line (also known as the Massa–Senigallia Line), in the linguistics of the Romance languages, is a line that demarcates a number of important isoglosses that distinguish Romance languages south and east of the line from Romance languages north and west of it. The line runs through northern Italy, very roughly from the cities of La Spezia to Rimini. Romance languages on the eastern half of it include Italian and the Eastern Romance languages (Romanian, Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, Istro-Romanian), whereas Spanish, French, Catalan, Portuguese as well as Gallo‒Italic languages are representatives of the Western group. (Sardinian does not fit into either Western or Eastern Romance.)\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

From 1659 onwards, the Bastille functioned primarily as a state penitentiary; by 1789, 5,279 prisoners had passed through its gates. Under Louis XV and XVI, the Bastille was used to detain prisoners from more varied backgrounds, and to support the operations of the Parisian police, especially in enforcing government censorship of the printed media. Although inmates were kept in relatively good conditions, criticism of the Bastille grew during the 18th century, fueled by autobiographies written by former prisoners. Reforms were implemented and prisoner numbers were considerably reduced. In 1789 the royal government's financial crisis and the formation of the National Assembly gave rise to a swelling of republican sentiments among city-dwellers. On 14 July the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary crowd, primarily residents of the faubourg Saint-Antoine who sought to commandeer the valuable gunpowder held within the fortress. Seven remaining prisoners were found and released and the Bastille's governor, Bernard-René de Launay, was killed by the crowd. The Bastille was demolished by order of the Committee of the Hôtel de Ville. Souvenirs of the fortress were transported around France and displayed as icons of the overthrow of despotism. Over the next century, the site and historical legacy of the Bastille featured prominently in French revolutions, political protests and popular fiction, and it remained an important symbol for the French Republican movement.\n\n[2] Storming of the Bastille: The Storming of the Bastille ( ) occurred in Paris, France, on the afternoon of 14 July 1789. The medieval fortress, armory, and political prison in Paris known as the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. The prison contained just seven inmates at the time of its storming, but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy's abuses of power; its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution.\n\n[3] Jean Antoine Rossignol: On the outbreak of the French Revolution, Rossignol was in Paris - in the words of his \"Memoirs\", \"On 12 July 1789 I knew nothing of the Revolution, and did not suspect in any manner that it could hold me in any way.\" However, he participated in the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 and in the revolutionary days of 20 June and 10 August (he was perhaps the man who shot Galiot Mandat de Grancey on 10 August).\n\n[4] History of Paris: On 11 July 1789, soldiers of the Royal-Allemand regiment attacked a large but peaceful demonstration on the Place Louis XV organized to protest the dismissal by the king of his reformist finance minister Jacques Necker. The reform movement turned quickly into a revolution.  On 13 July, a crowd of Parisians occupied the Hôtel de Ville, and the Marquis de Lafayette organized the French National Guard to defend the city. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquired thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, a prison that was a symbol of royal authority, but at that time held only seven prisoners. 87 revolutionaries were killed in the fighting. The governor of the Bastille, the Marquis de Launay, surrendered and then was killed, his head put on the end of a pike and carried around Paris. The provost of the merchants of Paris, Jacques de Flesselles, was also murdered. The fortress itself was completely demolished by November, and the stones turned into souvenirs. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the Hôtel de Ville on 15 July and chose as the first mayor of Paris the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly. Louis XVI came to Paris on 17 July, where he was welcomed by the new mayor and wore a tricolor cockade on his hat: red and blue, the colors of Paris, and white, the royal color.\n\n[5] Federalist revolts: In Marseille the repression which followed the Federalist defeat echoed that of Lyon. The city was renamed \"ville sans nom\" (\"town with no name\") on 28 August and Carteroux set up a revolutionary tribunal that began the Terror in Provence. In the autumn of 1793 Barras and Fréron extended the repression and there were a number of executions in October on the Canebière. In total, between August 1793 and April 1794, the Revolutionary Tribunal in Marseille tried 975 suspects and acquitted 476 of them; 289 of those convicted were actually executed.  Although Toulon had been a bastion of Jacobin support until July 1793, the Jacobins were swept out of power by Girondin sections in the second half of the month; the Jacobin club was sacked, various leading figures were obliged to flee, and those who did not flee were rounded up and held on a pontoon in the harbour. As in Normandy, the Convention's two représentants en mission were arrested and locked up. The loss of Toulon was a disaster for the Republic as almost the entirety of France’s Mediterranean fleet was anchored in the port at the time.\n\n[6] David Thomson (historian): Again using \"Europe Since Napoleon\" as an example, the scope of this work is Europe since 1815, but Thomson pointed out a \"necessary prologue\" consisting of four main phases since the beginning of the French Revolution in 1789. He listed these phases as \"Revolution, War, Dictatorship, Empire\" and set out to show how each gave place to the next and how profound and permanent was their cumulative impact on later generations. Beginning with the situation in France in 1789, Thomson wrote of the paradox that no significant group wanted revolution, but revolution happened because of the other things that they did want. Much had been made by previous historians of an assumed \"revolutionary spirit\" abroad in France that had been generated by the likes of Voltaire and Rousseau. Thomson argued that a connection between their ideas and the revolution was remote and indirect. They did not preach revolution and were happy to be patronised by any aristocrat so willing. It was later that their ideas and doctrines were used to justify revolutionary events. Instead, Thomson argued, what mattered in 1789 was a \"revolutionary situation\" that turned people into revolutionaries in spite of themselves. The \"philosophes\" played no part in the creation of this situation which came about essentially because the King, and thereby the entire French State, was in dire financial straits. The state of the economy, not philosophical belief, caused the French Revolution.\n\n[7] Saint-Germain-des-Prés: Because of its numerous printers and publishers, Saint‑Germain‑des‑Prés, and especially the Cordeliers Section of what is now the 6th arrondissement, became centers of revolutionary activity after 1789; they produced thousands of pamphlets, newspapers, and proclamations which influenced the Parisian population and that of France as a whole. The prison of the Abbey of Saint‑Germain‑des‑Prés, a two-storey building near the church, was filled with persons who had been arrested for suspicion of counter-revolutionary motives: former aristocrats, priests who refused to accept the revolutionary Constitution, foreigners, and so forth. By September 1792, Paris prisons were quite full. France, under the leadership of her Paris Convention, had declared herself a republic. The former king and queen were political prisoners and were moved from the Tuileries Palace to the old Knights Templar towers on the right bank, where there was less risk of rescue or escape. France was at war; the Duke of Brunswick had just issued his menacing manifesto, stating that if the former monarchy were not restored, he would raze Paris, and his troops were only a few days away. Now these political prisoners began to be viewed as a genuine threat, should any of them be conspiring with France's enemies. In what was a planned but inhumane tactic, politicians at Paris sent bands of criminals, armed mainly with pikes and axes, into each prison. Although at least one deputy from the Convention accompanied each band, the results were horrifying. Hundreds of prisoners were cut down between the end of August and the first week in September. As Englishman Arthur Young noted, the street outside one prison literally ran red with blood. The former Cordeliers Convent, closed by the revolutionaries, became the headquarters of one of the most radical factions, whose leaders\n\n[8] September Massacres: A total of nine prisons were violently entered during the five days of the massacres before the killings concluded on the night of 6–7 September; four were not visited (Sainte-Pélagie Prison, Prison Saint-Lazare, Tour du Temple and palais Bourbon). After initially indiscriminate slayings, ad hoc popular tribunals were set up to distinguish between \"enemies of the people\" and those who were innocent, or at least were not perceived as counter-revolutionary threats. In spite of this attempted sifting, an estimated three-quarters of the 1,300–1,400 killed were not counter-revolutionaries or \"villains\", but included all the galley convicts, forgers of assignats, 37 women (including the Princess de Lamballe and the book-seller Marie Gredeler, who was accused of murder) and 66 children. Some priests and women were of age, about prostitutes or insane not much is known.\n\n[9] 1562 Riots of Toulouse: In 1572, in reaction to the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in Paris, Toulouse officials ordered all suspected Reformed Church members to be placed in confinement (some held within Catholic convents, others in the municipal prison). On the night of October 3 (over a month after the Paris massacre) two merchants (father and son) named Delpeche arrived from Paris. They claimed they had orders \"to kill all\" Protestants. As evening progressed the Delpeches gained supporters and these self-appointed executioners took the Reformed Church members from their cells and murdered them. Between 200 and 300 Reformed Church members were slain in this manner. Among those killed were three councilors of the Parlement whose bodies, draped in their official robes, were hung from a tall tree in front of the seat of Parlement. Among those slain was Jean de Coras. Unlike other areas of France which responded with mob violence and indiscriminate killing, Toulouse's response to the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre was cold, efficient, and systematic. With knowledge of the killings, many surviving Toulousain Protestants (like others throughout France) abandoned their faith through abjuration at this time.\n\n[10] Federalist revolts: Given the scale and ferocity of the Convention's reprisals against Lyon, it is not surprising that during the First White Terror widespread hatred of Jacobins led to many acts of collective violence. On a number of occasions, including 2 February 1795, the mob broke into prisons and massacred of Jacobin prisoners held there. On 14 February Joseph Fernex, a judge on the former Revolutionary Committee, in prison since Thermidor, was killed and thrown into the Rhône by a mob. On 1 March another member of the Revolutionary Committee, Sautemouche, was killed. On 30 March 1795 the threat of another massacre of Jacobin prisoners was so great that the decision was taken to move them out of the city to Roanne and Mâcon. Nevertheless, on 4 April, several thousand rioters broke into the jails and killed 99 Jacobin prisoners.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat round is a classic AK-47 chambered in?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] AK-12: The cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 uses the same gas-operated long-stroke piston system of the previous Kalashnikov rifles, but many features are radically different from the other rifles in its family. The light version has the ability to change calibers by swapping the barrels. It is chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge as for the standard configuration and can be either changed to the 7.62×39mm or 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge. Other intermediate calibers are also expected. The heavy version will chamber the larger 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. It is fed through the standard AK-74M 30-round magazines and can also accept the 45-round magazines from the RPK-74. The 7.62×39mm Soviet-chambered version is compatible with the AKM/RPK 30-round and 40-round magazines and 75-round drum magazines. The magazines specifically for the cancelled prototype model of the AK-12 includes a 30-round magazine with bolt-catch actuator, a 60-round quad-stack magazine and a 95-round drum.\n\n[2] 7.62×39mm: The original Soviet M43 bullets are 123 grain boat-tail bullets with a copper-plated steel jacket, a large steel core, and some lead between the core and the jacket. The cartridge itself consisted of a Berdan-primed, highly tapered (usually steel) case which seats the bullet and contains the powder charge. The taper makes it very easy to feed and extract the round, since there is little contact with the chamber walls until the round is fully seated. This taper is what causes the AK-47 to have distinctively curved magazines (helping to distinguish AK-47s from AK-74s, which feed from a much straighter magazine). While the bullet design has gone through a few redesigns, the cartridge itself remains largely unchanged. The ballistic coefficient (G7 BC) of the M1943 pattern full metal jacket boat bullet is 0.138.\n\n[3] Colt CM901: In June 2014 Colt Canada announced the new CK901 (Colt\"-Kalashnikov\") in an interview with IHS Jane's at Eurosatory. It is a direct-impingement AR-AK hybrid chambered in 7.62x39mm that is similar to the KAC SR-47. The standard carbine has a 16-inch barrel, a monolithic picatinny rail along the upper receiver, a three-position accessory rail forend (sides and bottom), folding front sight, detachable rear sight, and ambidextrous controls. The carbine weighs in at 3.6 kg (7.9 lbs) without accessories and 4.5 kg (9.92 lbs.) with accessories (like a loaded magazine and sling). A Short-Barreled Rifle (SBR) version with a 13-inch barrel is also rumored to be in the works. It comes with polymer 30-round AK-style magazines manufactured by US-Palm, but it can supposedly feed from any AK-47 interface magazines.\n\n[4] AK-12: On 6 September 2016, it was reported that Kalashnikov Concern introduced the final production model of the AK-12, which is derived from the well proven AK-400 (Base Prototype) and has replaced the earlier prototype models. There were two base models that were introduced, the AK-12 which is chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge and the AK-15 which is chambered in 7.62×39mm cartridge. Kalashnikov Concern also introduced a new squad automatic weapon that is chambered in 5.45×39mm cartridge, the RPK-16 which is based on the traditional Kalashnikov layout and design and has several novel technical and ergonomic features derived from the AK-12 program. It was also reported that the final production model of the AK-12 and AK-15 began participating in troop trials with the Russian Army, where it competed against the Degtyarov A-545 and A-762 balanced action assault rifles. The AK-12 completed its operational testing and passed military field tests in June 2017. Both AK-12 and AK-15 completed testing in December 2017. In January 2018 it was announced that the AK-12 and AK-15 have been adopted by the Russian military.\n\n[5] S4M: It was a simple break-open, two-shot derringer, but the unique features came from its specialized ammunition, designed around a cut-down version of the 7.62×39mm rounds used in the Soviet AK-47. The casings of the round contained a piston-like plunger between the bullet and the powder that would move forward inside the casing when fired. The piston would push the round down the barrel and plug the end of the casing, completely sealing off any explosive gases in the casing. This, combined with the inherently low-velocity round resulted in a truly silent pistol. The nature of the gun and ammunition led to it being wildly inaccurate outside of point-blank range. To add further confusion and throw possible suspicion away from the assassin, the barrel rifling was designed to affect the bullet in such a way that ballistics experts would not only conclude that the round was fired from an AK-47, but that the round was fired from several hundred feet away.\n\n[6] AK-47: The AK-47's standard 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with \"feed-lips\" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that \"Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers\". This contributes to the AK-47 magazine being more reliable, but makes it heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines.\n\n[7] Zastava M76: Rather than being a Dragunov clone, it looks more like a lengthened AK-47 with a heavier barrel, an impression strengthened by the separate stock and pistol grip rather than the Dragunov's thumbhole combination stock. Instead of the Dragunov's 7,62×54mmR chambering it uses the 7.92×57mm Mauser a.k.a. the 7.9mm or 8×57mm IS round. The Yugoslav National Army (JNA) adopted a 7.9mm Cartridge, Ball M49 variant, designated as M49, as infantry ammunition at the end of the 1940s and later a 7.9mm Cartridge, Sniper, with Universal ball M75, as sniper ammunition, designated as M75. Instead of the Dragunov's separate gas piston, the M76 has an AK-type piston attached to the bolt carrier. The receiver is a milled forging like that of the original AK-47 to give greater rigidity when firing a full-power round and it is longer than the normal AK receiver to suit the 8×57mm IS chambering. The AK-type rotating bolt, bolt carrier, barrel and other parts are also longer and heavier to suit. Feeding is via a 10-round steel box magazine, which has a follower that holds the bolt open after the last shot. Since there is no device in the weapon to hold the bolt to the rear, the bolt will move forward when the magazine is removed, which increases the difficulty of removing the magazine. Fire is semi-automatic only, so the AK-47-type safety on the right side of the receiver has only 2 settings - 'safe' and 'fire'. The barrel has a tapered profile with a Dragunov-type combination slotted flash suppressor and foresight housing. A standard AKM bayonet can be fitted to\n\n[8] Comparison of the AK-47 and M16: The AK-47’s 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with \"feed-lips\" (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that \"Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers.\" This makes the AK-47 magazine more reliable, although heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines. The early slab-sided steel AK-47 magazines weigh empty. The later steel AKM magazines had lighter sheet-metal bodies with prominent reinforcing ribs weighing empty. The current issue steel-reinforced plastic magazines are even lighter, weighing empty. Early steel AK-47 magazines are 9.75 inches long, and the later ribbed steel AKM and newer plastic magazines are about an inch shorter.\n\n[9] Comparison of the AK-47 and M16: The original ammunition for the M16 was the 5.56×45mm M193 round. When fired from a 20\" barrel at ranges of up to 100 meters, the thin-jacketed lead-cored round traveled fast enough (above 2900 ft/s) that the force of striking a human body would cause the round to yaw (or tumble) and fragment into about a dozen pieces of various sizes thus created wounds that were out of proportion to its caliber. These wounds were much larger than those produced by AK-47 and they were so devastating that many considered the M16 to be an inhumane weapon. As the 5.56mm round's velocity decreases, so does the number of fragments that it produces. The 5.56mm round does not normally fragment at distances beyond 200 meters or at velocities below 2500 ft/s, and its lethality becomes largely dependent on shot placement.\n\n[10] Comparison of the AK-47 and M16: AK-47 type rifles are made in dozens of countries, with \"quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship.\" As a result, the AK-47 has a service/system life of approximately 6,000, to 10,000, to 15,000 rounds. The AK-47 was designed to be a cheap, simple, easy to manufacture assault rifle, perfectly matching Soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items. As units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on \"battlefield cannibalization\" for resupply, it is actually more cost-effective to replace rather than repair weapons.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

However, \"Boerenkaas\", \"Noord-Hollandse Gouda\", and \"Gouda Holland\" are registered in the EU as having Protected Geographical Indication status. These cheeses can only be made in the Netherlands (although not only in the Dutch provinces of South Holland, in which Gouda is situated) and can only use milk produced by Dutch cows.\n\n[2] Maaslander: Regular Dutch Gouda cheese contains salt from the use of brine in the production, which can lead to a high bloodpressure. So, the company began producing the Maaslander at a factory in Arkel in 1978. This cheese, slightly shallower, with a shorter time of immersion, resulted in a lower salinity and a mild-flavored cheese. Due to the shorter curing, the cheese contains more milk fluid.  Cheese factories outside the Netherlands also produce Maaslander cheese, for example in Flensburg, Germany.\n\n[3] Gouda, South Holland: Gouda () is a city and municipality in the province of South Holland, Netherlands with a population of 72,338. It is famous for its Gouda cheese, stroopwafels, many grachten, smoking pipes, and its 15th-century city hall. Gouda's array of historic churches and other buildings makes it a very popular day trip destination.\n\n[4] Gouda cheese: Gouda ( , ; , \"cheese from Gouda\") is a mild, yellow cheese made from cow's milk. It is one of the most popular cheeses worldwide. The name is used today as a general term for numerous similar cheeses produced in the traditional Dutch manner.\n\n[5] Gouda cheese: The first mention of Gouda cheese dates from 1184, making it one of the oldest recorded cheeses in the world still made today. Cheesemaking traditionally was a woman's task in Dutch culture, with farmers' wives passing their cheesemaking skills on to their daughters. To this day, farmers from the surrounding region gather in Gouda every Thursday morning between 10:00 am and 12:30 pm from June until August to have their cheeses weighed, tasted, and priced. Most Dutch Gouda is now produced industrially. However, some 300 Dutch farmers still produce \"boerenkaas\" (“farmers cheese”) which is a protected form of Gouda made in the traditional manner, using unpasteurized milk.\n\n[6] Gouda cheese: The cheese is named after the city of Gouda not because it was produced in or around that city, but because it was traded there. In the Middle Ages, Dutch cities could obtain certain feudal rights which gave them primacy or a total monopoly on certain goods. Within the County of Holland, Gouda acquired market rights on cheese, the sole right to have a market in which the county's farmers could sell their cheese. All the cheeses would be taken to the market square in Gouda to be sold. Teams consisting of the guild of cheese-porters, identified by differently colored straw hats, carried the farmers' cheeses on barrows, which typically weighed about 16 kg. Buyers then sampled the cheeses and negotiated a price using a ritual system called \"handjeklap\" in which buyers and sellers clap each other's hands and shout prices. Once a price was agreed upon, the porters would carry the cheese to the weighing house and complete the sale.\n\n[7] Gouda, South Holland: Gouda is world-famous for its Gouda cheese, which is still traded on its cheese market, held each Thursday. Gouda is also known for the fabrication of candles, smoking pipes, and stroopwafels. Gouda used to have a considerable linen industry and a number of beer breweries.\n\n[8] Dutch cheese markets: Gouda cheese has been traded on the \"Goudse kaasmarkt\" for more than three centuries. Nowadays, it is open from mid-June until August, every Thursday morning between 10:00 am and 12:30 pm. Farmers from the region gather to have their cheese weighed, tasted and priced. The Gouda cheese market is surrounded by many exhibitions of authentic Dutch professions, from cheese production to clog making and buttermilk preparation.\n\n[9] Gouda cheese: Various sources suggest that the term \"Gouda\" refers more to a general style of cheesemaking rather than to a specific kind of cheese, pointing to its taste varying with age. Young (and factory-produced) gouda has been described as having a flavor that is \"lightly fudgy with nuts, but very, very, very mild\", while the same source describes a more mature farmhouse Gouda as having a \"lovely fruity tang\" with a \"sweet finish\", that may take on \"an almost butterscotch flavor\" if aged over two years.\n\n[10] List of American cheeses: This is a list of cheeses typical of the United States. Types of cheese are included; brand names are only included if they apply to a distinct variety of cheese. Many additional European-type cheeses are also made in the United States, such as Brie, Cheddar, Gouda, mozzarella and provolone. Also, many local dairies throughout the country produce artisan cheeses and other more localized flavors. (The term \"American cheese\" is also sometimes misunderstood outside the United States to refer to processed cheese products.) Many American cheese varieties are related to European cheeses, with slightly different recipes, and with European-sounding names, such as Swiss cheese, which is not normally found or produced in Switzerland. Almost half of the cheese produced in the United States comes from Wisconsin and California.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Cynophobia is classified as a specific phobia, under the subtype \"animal phobias\". According to Dr. Timothy O. Rentz of the Laboratory for the Study of Anxiety Disorders at the University of Texas, animal phobias are among the most common of the specific phobias and 36% of patients who seek treatment report being afraid of dogs or cats. Although snakes and spiders are more common animal phobias, cynophobia is especially debilitating because of the high prevalence of dogs (for example, there are an estimated 25 million stray dogs in India, and an estimated 62 million pet dogs in the United States) and the general ignorance of dog owners to the phobia. The \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (\"DSM-IV-TR\") reports that only 12% to 30% of those suffering from a specific phobia will seek treatment.\n\n[2] Cynophobia: The book \"Phobias\" defines a panic attack as \"a sudden terror lasting at least a few minutes with typical manifestations of intense fear\". These manifestations may include palpitations, sweating, trembling, difficulty breathing, the urge to escape, faintness or dizziness, dry mouth, nausea and/or several other symptoms. As with other specific phobias, patients suffering from cynophobia may display a wide range of these reactions when confronted with a live dog or even when thinking about or presented with an image (static or filmed) of a dog. Furthermore, classic avoidance behavior is also common and may include staying away from areas where dogs might be (i.e., a park), crossing the street to avoid a dog, or avoiding the homes of friends and/or family who own a dog.\n\n[3] Cynophobia: A study was conducted at the State University of New York to distinguish the significance of these three conditions upon the development of cynophobia. Thirty-seven women ages 18 to 21 were first screened into two groups: fearful of dogs and non-fearful of dogs. Next, each woman was given a questionnaire which asked if she had ever had a frightening and/or painful confrontation with a dog, what her expectation was upon encountering a dog (pain, fear, etc.), and subjectively, what was the probability of that expectation actually occurring. The results indicated that, while non-fearful subjects had a different expectation of what would happen when encountering a dog, painful experiences with dogs were common among both groups; therefore, the study concluded that other factors must affect whether or not these painful experiences will develop into dog phobia.\n\n[4] Cynophobia: Although Rachman's theory is the accepted model of fear acquisition, cases of cynophobia have been cited in which none of these three causes apply to the patient. In a speech given at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research, Dr. Arne Öhman proposed that animal fears in particular are likely to be an evolutionary remnant of the necessity \"to escape and to avoid becoming the prey of predators\". Furthermore, in his book \"Overcoming Animal/Insect Phobias\", Dr. Martin Antony suggests that in the absence of Rachman's three causes, providing that the patient's memory is sound, biological factors may be a fourth cause of fear acquisition—meaning that the fear is inherited or is a throwback to an earlier genetic defense mechanism. In any case, these causes may in actuality be a generalization of a complicated blend of both learning and genetics.\n\n[5] Philophobia (fear): Philophobia (from Greek \"φιλος\" (love) and \"φοβία\" (phobia)), is the fear of falling in love or emotional attachment. The risk is usually when a person has confronted any emotional turmoil relating to love but also can be chronic phobia. This affects the quality of life and pushes a person away from commitment. The worst aspect of fear of being in love and falling in love is that it keeps a person in solitude. It can also evolve out of religious and cultural beliefs that prohibit love. It represents certain guilt and frustration towards the reaction coming from inside.\n\n[6] Cynophobia: A current theory for fear acquisition presented by Dr. S. Rachman in 1977 maintains that there are three conditions by which fear is developed. These include direct personal experience, observational experience, and informational or instructional experience. For example, direct personal experience consists of having a personal negative encounter with a dog such as being bitten. In contrast, seeing a friend attacked by a dog and thus developing a fear of dogs would be observational experience. Whereas both of these types of experiences involves a live dog, informational or instructional experience simply includes being told directly or indirectly (i.e., information read in a book, film, parental cues such as avoidance or dislike, etc.) that dogs are to be feared.\n\n[7] Cynophobia: In vivo or exposure therapy is considered the most effective treatment for cynophobia and involves systematic and prolonged exposure to a dog until the patient is able to experience the situation without an adverse response. This therapy can be conducted over several sessions or, as Dr. Lars-Göran Öst showed in a study done in 1988, can be done in a single multi-hour session. This study utilized 20 female patients suffering from various specific phobias and ranging in age from 16 to 44. Patients were each provided with an individual therapy session in which Dr. Öst combined exposure therapy with modeling (where another person demonstrates how to interact with the feared object) to reduce or completely cure the phobia. As each patient was gradually exposed to the feared stimulus, she was encouraged to approach and finally interact with it as her anxiety decreased, concluding the session when fear had been reduced by 50% or completely eliminated. Once the session was concluded, the patient was then to continue interaction with the feared object on her own to reinforce what had been learned in the therapy session. Dr. Öst's results were collected over a seven-year period and concluded that \"90% of the patients were much improved or completely recovered after a mean of 2.1 hours of therapy\".\n\n[8] Ochlophobia: Ochlophobia (\"Fear of Crowds\") and demophobia (\"Fear of Unruly Mobs\") are terms for types of social phobia or social anxiety disorder whose sufferers have a fear of crowds. Sufferers may offer various rationalizations of the phobia, such as the fear being trampled in a crowd, getting a deadly disease from people within the crowd, getting lost in the crowd, or feeling insignificant when surrounded by a crowd.\n\n[9] Ephebiphobia: The fear of youth, along with fear of street culture and the fear of crime, is said to have been in Western culture for \"time immemorial\". Machiavelli is said to have realized that a fear of youth is what kept the city of Florence from keeping a standing army. Ancient Venice and ancient Greece are also said to have had floundering public policy because of their fear of youth.\n\n[10] Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great: The book centers on Sheila Tubman, a ten-year-old girl who masks her insecurities with a much more self-assured, confident person. In truth, she suffers from fears ranging from arachnophobia (fear of spiders and other arachnids), cynophobia (fear of dogs), and aquaphobia (fear of water).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

While the basic drink is simply the two ingredients, there are many variations; the most common one is made with one part vodka, one part of any kind of orange soda, and one part of orange juice. Many of the variations have different names in different parts of the world. The International Bartenders Association has designated this cocktail as an IBA Official Cocktail.\n\n[2] Screwdriver (cocktail): The screwdriver is mentioned in 1944: \"A Screwdriver—a drink compounded of vodka and orange juice and supposedly invented by interned American fliers\"; and in 1949: \"the latest Yankee concoction of vodka and orange juice, called a 'screwdriver'\".\n\n[3] Matador (cocktail): The Matador is a tequila-based cocktail. Less widely known than the margarita, its structure is similarly simple, with three primary ingredients: silver or \"blanco\" tequila, pineapple juice, and lime juice. Its chief coupling of pineapple and a single spirit resembles a Jackhammer, a variant of the Screwdriver which substitutes pineapple juice for orange juice to mix with vodka. Matadors are often presented differently, either in a martini glass or a champagne flute.\n\n[4] Orange Tundra: This mixed drink was first discovered in 2003 and became wildly popular thereafter. This drink's name is largely attributed to its cold serving temperature and orange appearance due to the use of orange juice.The ingredients are added to the highball glass in the following order: vodka, cream soda, coffee liqueur and finally, orange juice. Although ice can be added, the drink should not be stirred before serving.\n\n[5] Orange juice: Orange juice is a liquid extract of the orange tree fruit, produced by squeezing oranges. It comes in several different varieties, including blood orange, navel oranges, valencia orange, clementine, and tangerine. As well as variations in oranges used, some varieties include differing amounts of juice vesicles, known as \"pulp\" in American English, and \"(juicy) bits\" in British English. These vesicles contain the juice of the orange and can be left in or removed during the manufacturing process. How juicy these vesicles are depend upon many factors, such as species, variety, and season. In American English, the beverage name is often abbreviated as \"OJ\".\n\n[6] SnoBar Cocktails: The ice cream is available in the following flavors: Grasshopper, Pink Squirrel, Brandy Alexander and Brandy Alexander with Chocolate Chips. The Grasshopper includes all of the traditional ingredients of brandy, creme de menthe and creme de cacao; the Pink Squirrel includes brandy, almond liquer and creme de cacao; Brandy Alexander features brandy and creme de cacao while the Brand Alexander with Chocolate Chips includes brandy, creme de cacao and chocolate chips. With a pure alcohol content range of 3.59 to 6.41 percent (8.22 to 14.67 alc/vol), each serving of SnöBar ice-pops and ice cream has the equivalent alcohol percentage of a full cocktail.\n\n[7] Orange juice: Common orange juice is made from the sweet orange. Different cultivars (for example, Valencia, Hamlin) have different properties, and a producer may mix cultivar juices to get the desired taste. Orange juice usually varies between shades of orange and yellow, although some ruby red or blood orange varieties are a reddish-orange or even pinkish. This is due to different pigmentation in ruby red oranges.\n\n[8] Saint Clement's (cocktail): The Saint Clement's is a non-alcoholic cocktail. Though the ingredients may vary, it consists of orange juice mixed with bitter lemon, usually in equal proportions; the name of the drink refers to the English nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons. The drink is therefore named (indirectly) after either St Clement Eastcheap or St Clement Danes, both churches in London. The traditional recipe calls for equal parts orange juice and lemon juice served over ice in a highball glass. There are many variations, in which the lemon juice is replaced with a sweeter drink (like lemonade), or even a carbonated citrus-flavored soft drink (like Sprite, 7-Up, or Fanta Lemon).\n\n[9] Donkey punch (cocktail): Donkey Punch is a punch or cocktail made of 1 part rum, 3 parts orange juice, 2 parts ginger ale, 1 part pineapple juice and Grenadine syrup. The ingredients are poured into shaker filled with ice and shaken well before pouring it into a large glass filled with ice cubes. The ingredients can also be mixed together in a punch bowl and served with ice and orange slices floating on top.\n\n[10] Simply Orange Juice Company: The Simply Orange Juice Company is a company in Apopka, Florida, that was founded in 2001 and is a brand of The Coca-Cola Company. It makes a number of not-from-concentrate orange juices and other juice drinks and fruit juices that are sold refrigerated in a distinctive clear plastic bottle and green twist top with a large green seal. The bottles have a wide body that starts tapering to a narrow neck at the top of the label.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

For centuries, they could be owned only by members of the Chinese Imperial Palace. Similarly ancient are the lapdog ancestors of the modern breeds of Tibetan Terrier, Lhasa Apso, Pug, and Shih Tzu.\n\n[2] Pekingese: The breed originated in China in antiquity. Recent DNA analysis confirms that the Pekingese breed is one of the oldest breeds of dog, one of the least genetically diverged from the wolf. For centuries, they could only be owned by members of the Chinese Imperial Palace.\n\n[3] Pekingese: The breed was favored by royalty of the Chinese Imperial court as both a lap dog and companion dog, and its name refers to the city of Peking (Beijing) where the Forbidden City is located. The breed has several characteristics and health issues related to its unique appearance. Because of its desirable characteristics, the Pekingese has been part of the development of designer crossbreeds, such as the Peekapoo (crossed with a poodle) and Peke-a-tese (crossed with a Maltese).\n\n[4] Chinese Imperial Dog: The Chinese Imperial Dog was first bred in China in the Imperial Palace where the smaller ones were carried by the nobility in the sleeves of their robes. This breed of dog was gifted to foreign dignities as gifts in Imperial China After coming to the United States there were always breeders that bred the smaller dogs but the Chinese Imperial Dog did not receive recognition until March 2005. In the 1980s and 1990s the breed got the nicknames \"teacup\", \"mini\", and \"tiny toy\"\n\n[5] Chinese Imperial Dog: The Chinese Imperial Dog is a Toy dog breed with a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. Kennel clubs originally classified the breed under the shih-tzu, before recognizing the Imperial as a separate breed. Other names for the Chinese Imperial Dog include: Imperial Shih Tzu, Lion Dog, Micro Shih Tzu, Miniature Shih Tzu, Princess-type Shih Tzu, Tiny Teacup Shih Tzu, Tiny Toy Shih Tzu. The purpose of the Chinese Imperial Dog is considered a .\n\n[6] Chinese Imperial Dog: There is not agreement among experts as to origin date of the Chinese Imperial Dog. The Chinese Imperial Dog Club of America claims that the Chinese Imperial Dog has been in existence for over 2000 while The American Kennel Club claims it has only been in existence since the 1960s. The reason behind the origin debate is that the Chinese Imperial Dog is almost identical to the Shih Tzu in every aspect except for their size.\n\n[7] Chinese Chongqing Dog: The history of this breed can be traced back to Western Han Dynasty (BC 202- AD 8). Archaeologists found a huge Western Han Dynasty’s graveyard in Chongqing on 20th April, 2000. A large number of dog pottery statues of their kind were found. Some of them served the purpose of being protector Gods to accompany the tomb of the noble family in spirit. This ancient breed was also used for hunting in the mountain area of East Sichuan. They are intelligent, fearless, agile species with outstanding senses of smell. Chongqing dog are medium-sized dogs and are covered with short harsh coat, which enhances their flexibility to go through the bush while hunting.\n\n[8] Xiasi Dog: Xiasi Dog (also known as Xiasi Quan or Bai Long Quan) is a breed of dog originating from Guizhou Province in China, recognised by the Chinese Kennel Club. Since the breed is mainly raised in the town of Xiasi, Kaili city, the official name for this breed is Xiasi Quan, though members of the Miao ethnic group also refer to this breed as Bai Long Quan.\n\n[9] Lu Xun Park: The pre-1928 prohibition against Chinese visitors in foreign-administered Shanghai parks was the subject of much debate among Chinese intellectuals. The park regulations stated that the facilities were exclusively for the use of the foreign community, and also that dogs, horses, and bicycles were prohibited. Critics later paraphrased these regulations into various fictitious versions such as \"Dogs and Chinese not admitted\", juxtaposing the low status of Chinese citizens in their own country with that of dogs. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, denounced the restrictions in effect at the Garden and at Hongkou Park in a speech in 1924. Most famously, Bruce Lee's film \"Fist of Fury\" depicted Lee's character being barred from entry into the Public Garden, resulting in him kicking and breaking the sign displaying the regulations.\n\n[10] Pekingese: According to the 1948 publication \"Dogs In Britain, A Description of All Native Breeds and Most Foreign Breeds in Britain\" by Clifford LB Hubbard, the Sleeve Pekingese is a true miniature of the standard-sized dog, and was also known as the Miniature Pekingese. The name \"Sleeve Pekingese\" came from the custom of carrying these small dogs in the capacious sleeves of the robes worn by members of the Chinese Imperial Household. Hubbard indicated that this tradition appeared to be early Italian rather than Chinese, but its adoption by the Chinese Imperial Household led to dogs being bred as small as possible and to practices aimed at stunting their growth: giving puppies rice wine, holding new-borns tightly for hours at a time or putting the puppies into tight-fitting wire mesh waistcoats. These practices were apparently forbidden by Dowager Empress Cixi.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Raw material choice; either whole fish or by-products, depends on the commercial sources of the fish. In some cases, the fillet portions are removed for human consumption, the remaining fish body (generally the guts, bones, cartilage, scales and remaining meat) is put into water and ground up. Some fish hydrolysate is ground more finely than others so more bone material is able to remain suspended. Enzymes may also be used to dissolve bones, scale and meat. If the larger chunks of bone and scales are screened out, calcium or mineral content may be lacking in the finished product form. If purchasing fish hydrolysate for agricultural applications, one should look at the label carefully for the concentration of mineral elements in the liquid. Some fish hydrolysates have been made into a dried product, increasing the potential for inclusion as an ingredient in other food or feed products. The oil is separated out in this process, which means the Omega 3 fatty acid would remain with the oil and not the hydrolysate.\n\n[2] Fish hydrolysate: If fish hydrolysate is heated, the oils and certain proteins can be more easily removed to be sold in purified forms. The complex protein, carbohydrate and fats in the fish material are denatured, which means they are broken down into less complex foods. Overheating can result in destruction of the material as a food to grow beneficial organisms. Once the oils are removed and proteins denatured and simplified by the heating process, this material is called a fish emulsion. The hydrolysate process has substantially lower capital and production costs compared to fish emulsion production.\n\n[3] Fish hydrolysate: There are many uses of fish hydrolysate - from fish-based fertilizer, to its use as an animal food, or new human consumption applications which are developing. A number of scientific journals have cited the antiproliferative activity of fish protein hydrolysate, which makes it eligible for listing as a nutriceutical.\n\n[4] Fish hydrolysate: The liquid fish hydrolysate process minces the whole fish, then enzymatically digests, then grinds and liquifies the resulting product, known as gurry. Because it is a cold process, gurry putrefies more rapidly than fish emulsion and needs to be stabilized at a lower pH, requiring more acid. Researchers have tried formic acid, sulfuric acid, and others. Formic acid had phytotoxic effects on plants. Phosphoric acid is the preferred stabilizer.\n\n[5] Hydrolysate: Hydrolysate refers to any product of hydrolysis. Protein hydrolysate has special application in sports medicine because its consumption allows amino acids to be absorbed by the body more rapidly than intact proteins, thus maximizing nutrient delivery to muscle tissues. It is also used in the biotechnology industry as a supplement to cell cultures. In the December 2013 edition of \"The International Journal of Food Science and Technology\", hydrolysate was shown to be rich in L-aspartic acid and the necessary minerals manganese and selenium\n\n[6] Fish protein powder: Enzymatic hydrolysis similar to the body's natural digestive process provides the most efficient breakdown of the proteins into smaller fractions termed peptides which can then be separated from the oil and non-digested proteins during liquid phase processing. Subsequent steps of solids and oil removal through various mechanical separation techniques are required to create a final fish protein fraction with acceptable organoleptic properties for use in human food. Minimization of odor through the elimination of fat and oil from the protein fraction, as well as separating out the lowest molecular weight protein fractions from the larger fractions all serve to create a refined fish protein. Some processes utilize solvents to extract the fat but these can result in dangerous handling and potential residual issues. The final step in producing the product is typically spray drying, which involves atomizing the liquid protein in a hot air chamber resulting in rapid evaporation of the water and a fine powder falling to the bottom of the chamber for removal. Spray drying is different from typical oven dehydration used in animal grade fish meal production in that spray drying will not denature the protein fraction resulting in a higher quality protein product for human consumption.\n\n[7] Fish hydrolysate: New technologies that have increased fishing efficiency have also resulted in the taking of species or sizes not suitable for market, known as bycatch. An increased catch of unsaleable whole fish has resulted from the increased bycatch of the fishing industry. These fish are often dumped overboard at sea, but are also brought into port in the holds of fishing boats. This has spurred an incentive to find a market for the bycatch in order to lower the cost of production.\n\n[8] Passive electrolocation in fish: Fish use electroreception to detect the electrical fields produced by other fish, but they also need a way to navigate to the source of the electric field. The use of electroreception to locate the source of the electric field is known as electroreception. Local bioelectric fields produced do not remain strong, and get proportionally weaker to the cube of the distance. These low frequency bioelectric fields are produced from a dipole like orientation in the body of the fish when detected from a farther distance. The current will flow from negative to positive. Using electrodes, Hopkins made different orientations of electric fields to test how fish navigate. He aligned the field radially, tangentially, and at a 45-degree geometry orientation. In other cases, the dipoles could rotate and thus rotate the electric field. The field flows from a positive electrode to the negative electrode. The tuberous cells in teleosts play a role in detecting the electric fields and helping the fish to proper orient.\n\n[9] Gelatin: The worldwide production amount of gelatin is about . On a commercial scale, gelatin is made from by-products of the meat and leather industries. Most gelatin is derived from pork skins, pork and cattle bones, or split cattle hides. Gelatin made from fish by-products avoids some of the religious objections to gelatin consumption. The raw materials are prepared by different curing, acid, and alkali processes that are employed to extract the dried collagen hydrolysate. These processes may take several weeks, and differences in such processes have great effects on the properties of the final gelatin products.\n\n[10] Hydrolyzed vegetable protein: For the production of aHVP, the proteins are hydrolyzed by cooking with a diluted (15–20%) hydrochloric acid, at a temperature between 90 and 120°C for up to 8 hours. After cooling, the hydrolysate is neutralized with either sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to a pH of 5 to 6. The hydrolysate is filtered to remove the insoluble carbohydrate fraction (humin) and then further refined. The source of the raw material, concentration of the acid, the temperature of the reaction, the time of the reaction, and other factors can all affect the organoleptic properties of the final product. Activated carbon treatment can be employed to remove both flavor and color components, to the required specification. Following a final filtration, the aHVP may, depending upon the application, be fortified with additional flavoring components. Thereafter, the product can be stored as a liquid at 30–40% dry matter, or alternatively it may be spray dried or vacuum dried and further used as a food ingredient.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was released on June 14, 2011 through Rise Records. On May 13, 2011, they released the song \"Still YDG'N\". The album was leaked onto the internet on June 10, 2011, with Rise Records countering the leak by uploading the album on to their YouTube page four days before the release. The album debuted at number 28 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling over 13,000 copies in its first week, making it one of Rise Records' best-selling releases at the time. It is also the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Alan Ashby, as well as the last release to feature bassist and clean vocalist Shayley Bourget. It marks a considerably heavier, technical musical approach from the band, and a stronger use of clean vocals from Bourget, having him lead three songs on the album (\"My Understandings\", \"Purified\" and \"When You Can't Sleep at Night\").\n\n[2] Cold World (Of Mice &amp; Men album): Cold World is the fourth studio album by American metalcore band Of Mice & Men, released on September 9, 2016 through Rise Records. The album was produced by David Bendeth and is the follow-up to the group's third studio album, \"Restoring Force\" (2014). The lead single, \"Pain\", was released on June 27, 2016. Another single, \"Real\", was released on August 4, and then another new song, \"Contagious\", on August 29. The album was released early exclusively on Apple Music on September 2, 2016. It received mixed-to-negative reviews from critics. The album reached number 20 in the US, selling 19,000 copies in its first week. This is the last album to feature Austin Carlile as he left the band a few months later due to his health issues.\n\n[3] Of Mice &amp; Men (album): Of Mice & Men is the eponymous debut studio album by American metalcore band Of Mice & Men. It was originally planned to be released on February 23, 2010, but was delayed until March 9. This is the only album to feature bassist and backing vocalist Jaxin Hall.\n\n[4] Of Mice &amp; Men (band): On December 1, 2013, the band released their first single from \"Restoring Force\". The single, \"You're Not Alone\", is the band's first release with new bassist and clean vocalist Aaron Pauley. They announced that \"Bones Exposed\" would be the next song released from the new album; it was released on December 23. After the album was released, the band toured as a support act for British metalcore band Bring Me the Horizon, along with metalcore band Issues, on the American Dream Tour throughout America, starting early February and finishing in late March. Once the tour finished, the band headlined in the UK, with Issues and Beartooth supporting them throughout April.\n\n[5] Of Mice &amp; Men (band): Of Mice & Men has most often been considered a metalcore band. The band's debut self-titled album has been considered a typical metalcore album comparable with the work of The Devil Wears Prada, We Came as Romans, and Carlile's former band Attack Attack!, and to contain elements of post-hardcore. Their second album, \"The Flood\", was described as atypical to modern metalcore and more melodic than their earlier work, and as featuring some slight elements of nu metal. Their third album, \"Restoring Force\", incorporated a lot more nu metal elements into their sound, with a \"Rock Sound\" review describing the album's style as a mixture of nu metal and metalcore.\n\n[6] II (METZ album): II is the second studio album by Canadian noise rock band METZ, released internationally on May 4, 2015 on Sub Pop. It was released a day later in North America. \"II\" was produced by the band, and engineered by Alex Bonenfant and Graham Walsh. Walsh is best known as a member of Toronto-based electronica band Holy Fuck. The album received mostly positive reviews.\n\n[7] Of Mice &amp; Men discography: American metalcore band Of Mice & Men has released five studio albums, one live album, 14 singles and 18 music videos.\n\n[8] Defy (album): Defy is the fifth studio album by American metalcore band Of Mice & Men, released on January 19, 2018 through Rise Records. The album was produced by Howard Benson and is the follow-up to the group's fourth album, \"Cold World\" (2016). This is the first album to feature Aaron Pauley as the sole lead vocalist following the departure of Austin Carlile, who left the band in late 2016 due to health issues.\n\n[9] Of Mice &amp; Men (band): Of Mice & Men (often abbreviated OM&M) is an American metalcore band from Orange County, California. The band's lineup currently consists of lead vocalist and bassist Aaron Pauley, lead guitarist Phil Manansala, rhythm guitarist Alan Ashby, and drummer Valentino Arteaga. The group was founded by Austin Carlile and Jaxin Hall in mid-2009 after Carlile's departure from Attack Attack!. Since 2009, the band has released five studio albums. Carlile departed from the band in December 2016 citing that a long term health condition prompted his exit. After Carlile's departure the band continued to pursue creating music with Pauley as the band's bassist and lead vocalist.\n\n[10] Nu metalcore: In the early 2010s, metalcore and deathcore groups such as Emmure, Of Mice & Men, Suicide Silence, Here Comes the Kraken and Issues, all gained moderate popularity for drawing influence from nu metal. Suicide Silence's 2011 album \"The Black Crown\", which features elements of nu metal and metalcore/deathcore, peaked at number 28 on the \"Billboard\" 200. In 2014, Issues' self-titled debut album peaked at number 9 on the same chart. The album features elements of metalcore, nu metal, pop and R&B. Of Mice & Men's 2014 album \"Restoring Force\", which features elements of nu metal, peaked at number 4 on the \"Billboard\" 200. Bring Me the Horizon, previously known for a much heavier style of music, released their fifth album \"That's the Spirit\", which peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200, in 2015. The album draws from multiple genres, including nu metal; however, the band completely abandoned their metalcore style by the time of this album's release. According to \"The Soundboard\" in 2016, \"nu-metalcore has become [...] omnipresent\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was written by a man named Joseph Lees from the Glodwick area of the town in 1805. \"Grinfilt\" is a dialect pronunciation of Greenfield, a village in the neighbouring parish of Saddleworth. The main character believes that the historic county boundary between Lancashire and Yorkshire is a boundary between nations, and he prepares to set off to Oldham in the belief that this is where the French live. At the time of writing, the Napoleonic Wars were under way and Jone is eager to take part. The poem was very popular, and was widely imitated elsewhere in England.\n\n[2] Greenfield, Greater Manchester: The poem \"Jone o Grinfilt\" was written about a fictional inhabitant of the village with the aim of ridiculing countryside dwellers. The poem was written in the Oldham dialect of English, and was very popular in the 19th century. The author was probably Joseph Lees of Glodwick and it was written in the first decade of the 19th century.\n\n[3] Four Loom Weaver: Four Loom Weaver (Roud 1460), probably derived from \"The Poor Cotton Weaver\" is a 19th-century English lament on starvation. One source also names it Jone o Grinfilt though this title usually refers to different lyrics and score, which is about the naiveté of country folk. Actually, it is very similar to Jone o'Grinfilt Junior which can be found in John Harland's \"Ballads and Songs of Lancashire\" (1875 pp. 169–171). According to Axon website (Axon) Jone o Grinfilt was written by Joseph Lees of Glodwick, near Oldham in the 1790s.\n\n[4] Jone o Grinfilt: The poem circulated in the form of broadsides and is known to have been sung for King George III. Two broadside ballads naming Jone o Grinfilt in their titles are reproduced by Martha Vicinus in \"Broadsides of the Industrial North\", 1975. One is this poem and the other is better known as \"Th' Owdham Wayver\" or \"The Poor Cotton Weaver\". They were probably printed in the mid 19th century; the poem was also printed in John Harland's \"Ballads and Songs of Lancashire\" (three editions: 1865, 1875 and 1882).\n\n[5] Cecil Gray (composer): His first published book, \"A Survey of Contemporary Music\" was published in 1924, and was notable for its contrary opinions. Frank Howes, \"The Times\" chief music critic pointed out that the formula \"so far from the usual view being true, the precise opposite is the case\" occurs every few pages. With Heseltine, Gray co-authored the characteristically perverse \"Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa: Musician and Murderer\" in 1926. A full, but equally unorthodox \"History of Music\" followed in 1928. Gray was also an early advocate of Sibelius, championing his music in the UK from 1923 when it was still all but unknown there. He wrote two books on the composer in 1931 and 1935. His sympathetic portrayal of Heseltine/Warlock in his memoir of 1934 is thought by many to be his best literary work. There were also two collections of essays, \"Predicaments\" (1936) and \"Contingencies\" (1947), a play about Gilles de Rais and an autobiography, \"Musical Chairs\" (1948).\n\n[6] Edmund Neupert: He was now best remembered as the soloist at the world premiere of Edvard Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor. This occurred on 3 April 1869 in the Casino Concert Hall in Copenhagen, with the Royal Danish Orchestra conducted by Holger Simon Paulli. The piano used for the performance was lent for the occasion by Anton Rubinstein, who attended the concert. Grieg himself was not present, due to commitments back home in Norway. Neupert was also the dedicatee of the second edition of the concerto (Rikard Nordraak was the original dedicatee), and was said to have actually composed the cadenza in the first movement.\n\n[7] Frederick Grant Gleason: Gleason's compositions include: the \"Festival Ode\" (words by Harriet Monroe) sung by 500 voices with orchestra at the opening of the Auditorium Theatre, Chicago on 9 December 1889; \"Processional of the Holy Grail\" written for the Chicago World's Fair; a symphonic Poem, \"Edris\", based on a novel by Marie Corelli; the tone poem \"Song of Life\" (after a poem by Swinburne); a Piano Concerto; a cantata with orchestra,\"The Culprit Fay\"; and two operas: \"Otho Visconti\" and \"Montezuma\". The former was produced at Chicago in 1907. He left other scores in manuscript, with instructions that they were not to publicly performed until fifty years after his death.\n\n[8] Edvard Grieg: Grieg's \"Holberg Suite\" was originally written for the piano, and later arranged by the composer for string orchestra. Grieg wrote songs in which he set lyrics by poets Heinrich Heine, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henrik Ibsen, Hans Christian Andersen, Rudyard Kipling and others. Russian composer Nikolai Myaskovsky used a theme by Grieg for the variations with which he closed his Third String Quartet. Norwegian pianist Eva Knardahl recorded the composer's complete piano music on 13 LPs for BIS Records in 1977-1980. The recordings were reissued in 2006 on 12 compact discs, also on BIS Records. Grieg himself recorded many of these piano works before his death in 1907.\n\n[9] Miriam Gideon: Gideon composed a lot of vocal music, setting texts by Francis Thompson, Christian Morgenstern, Anne Bradstreet, Norman Rosten, Serafin, Joaquín Quintero and others.  Selected compositions include \"Lyric Piece for Strings\" (1942), \"Mixco\" (1957), \"Adon Olom\", \"Fortunato\", \"Sabbath Morning Service\", \"Friday Evening Service\", and \"Of Shadows Numberless\" (1966).\n\n[10] Greg O'Connor: O'Connor wrote all the opening songs for the ABC summer series Greatest Hits, produced by Grammy producer Kenneth Ehrlich. He also composed all the music for a reboot of Mad TV on the CW. He wrote the theme song for the series Gay Skit Happens with two members of the Grammy winning vocal group Pentatonix. In the science fiction thriller genre, O'Connor also scored the virtual reality series Defrost, directed by Randal Kleiser, which is one of the first long form dramatic series in this new groundbreaking genre. O'Connor co-wrote the theme song with actor Will Sasso for his Ten Minute Podcast starring Will, Chris D’Elia and Bryan Callan.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is located in the village of Austrheim. The church is part of the Austrheim parish in the Nordhordland deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in 1865 by the architect Askild Åse. The church was consecrated on 2 April 1865 by the Bishop Peter Hersleb Graah Birkeland. The church seats about 450 people. Austrheim Church has a long history. There was a medieval stave church, mentioned in historical records in 1360. That old church was replaced by a log church in 1659. On 16 November 1710, the church was damaged by lightning. The log church was demolished in 1865 to make room for a new church which still stands today.\n\n[2] Ulm Minster: Michael Parler, who had experience from working at the Dombauhütte in Prague, assumed construction of the church in 1381 and continued work on the nave, which had originally been conceived as a triple-aisled hall church with approximately equal height and width. From 1387 to 1391, Heinrich III Parler managed construction as head of the Bauhütte. Then in 1392 Ulrich Ensingen, associated with Strasbourg Cathedral, was appointed master builder. It was Parler's plan to construct the Ulm Minster's spire, the highest of any church. In order to balance its proportions, the nave was now to be much taller than the Parlers had intended, making a noticeable difference in height between the chancel and nave. The cathedral was consecrated on 25 July 1405. In 1446, Ulrich's son Matthäus took over construction and finished the choir vault in 1449 and the vault over the northern nave in 1452. When he died in 1463, his own son, Mortiz, took over construction. Himself dying in 1471, he completed the vaulting over the nave and constructed the sacrament house, finally making the church a basilica according to Ulrich's plan.\n\n[3] Neresheim Abbey: After much internal debate, in 1745, the decision was taken to build a new abbey church instead of rebuilding the old Romanesque church, which had been superficially updated to the Baroque style in the late 17th century. Abbot Amandus Fischer (1711–29) had brought in architect Dominikus Zimmermann to rebuild and redecorate the abbey's Festsaal, which was carried out in 1719-20 in a high Rococo style. Seeking stylistic continuity with his predecessor's building program, Abbot Aurelius Braisch (1739–55) commissioned architect and building engineer Johann Balthasar Neumann to rebuild the abbey church in 1747. Neumann, the most sought-after architect in central Europe at the time, had designed the pilgrimage church of Vierzehnheiligen and the Residenz at Würzburg, which were admired for their light formal invention, sumptuous materials and lightness of touch. Neumann's plan called for a conventional basilica consisting of nave, crossing and choir which were articulated as a series of oval-shaped bays surmounted with shallow domes.\n\n[4] St Andrew's Church, Kiev: The Petersburg Building Chancellery first hired German architect Gottfried Johann Schädel and engineer Daniel de Bosquet to draft out the plans for the church. However, when Schädel presented his project in 1745, the Chancellery rejected it. He was replaced by head architect of the imperial court, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, who worked out a plan which was closely based on a church of a Saint Petersburg institute. The construction itself was conducted by a team of Ukrainian, Russian, and foreign masters under the direction of architect Ivan Michurin, who was previously successful in replacing the older Church of the Resurrection, on the Women's Market Square (\"Babiy torzhok\") in Moscow. Michurin was responsible for carrying out all of the engineering and geological researches of the site and found out that a hard subsoil ground lies at a depth of 13–14 meters and above — made grounds penetrated by subterranean waters. With this information, Michurin developed the construction of a stone foundation and connected it with the two-storied building of the Priest's apartments, planned by Rastrelli.\n\n[5] Allmann Sattler Wappner: The year 2000 marked the unveiling of a controversial new building designed by the architecture firm, the Herz Jesu Church in Munich. It is essentially a glass cube, the portals of which can be opened up almost completely. In 2002, Allmann Sattler Wappner attracted major attention for a building complex housing the training facilities and the administration of Südwestmetall, the Baden-Wuerttemberg employers' organization of the metal and electrical industry, in Reutlingen. The entire facade was completely covered with stainless steel plates, combining the individual building elements into a single unit. The Swiss daily newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung described it as an \"esthetic innovation\" that immediately catches the eye. In 2001, the magazine-style supplement Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin sponsored a competition for a home of the future, which was to be built on the grounds of the Federal Horticulture Show in Munich. Allmann Sattler Wappner Architekten won the tender with a design that combined several independent building structures into one home. The Haus der Gegenwart was officially opened in 2005. In 2009, the Dornier Museum in Friedrichshafen, another project by the architecture firm, received rave reviews in the media.\n\n[6] Osterhofen Abbey: The monastery church, built in colored stucco and marble, is one of the most lavishly decorated in Lower Bavaria. It was designed and built between 1726 and 1740 by the Munich architect and master-builder Johann Michael Fischer (1727–28) and the brothers Cosmas Damian Asam and Egid Quirin Asam. The nave is large, bright and spacious, with a high ceiling. The Asam brothers created a throne room in honor of God, a \"theatrum sacrum\". Cosmas Damian Asam, a brilliant painter, created the wonderful frescoes in the church. His brother Egid Quirin Asam filled the church interior with sculptures and ornaments, notably the impressive high altar. The altarpiece represents Saint Margaret set within a pagan environment, with a statue of Venus in a temple behind her. The church is considered a masterpiece of late baroque Bavarian church architecture. In 1983 the church became the Minor Basilica of St. Margaret, known as the Asambasilika. Citations Sources\n\n[7] Amorbach: The late-Baroque hall church replaced an earlier one, St. Gangolf and St. Sebastian, documented for 1182. It was built in 1751-3 by local \"Oberamtmann\" Johann Franz Wolfgang Damian von Ostein and his brother and Archbishop, Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein. The design was based on plans by Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn, building work was supervised by his apprentice Alexander Jakob Schmidt. The design was inspired by St. Peter's Church at Mainz. The interior reflects Rococo style and the onset of the Neoclassical style. Ceiling frescoes by Johannes Zick show the lives of St. Gangolf (Gangulphus) and Saint Sebastian as well as King David as the \"father\" of Solomon's Temple. Oil paintings in the choir by depict the legendary beginnings of Amorbach. The marble high altar was made by Georg Schrantz, while Josef Keilwerth added the four statues. The cross by J.B. Berg dates from 1808. The side altars (1720) were originally used in the predecessor building. The organ also dates from 1720, but was located at Neustadt am Main Abbey until 1806, when it was bought by the Amorbach parish. The church has two pulpits, made from stucco by Antonio Rossi.\n\n[8] Austrheim (village): Austrheim is a village in Austrheim municipality in Hordaland county, Norway. The village is located on the south-central part of the island of Fosnøyna, at the end of the Austrheimsvågen bay. The village lies about southwest of the municipal centre of Årås. Austrheim Church is located in this village. It is the only church in the municipality.\n\n[9] Christian Schrade: At this time the Evangelical Church community were intending to build a high-profile \"Central\" church in a new quarter of Mannheim. A competition was held between various architects to present proposals for what would become Mannheim's new . Theophil Frey won the first prize and on 24 June 1904 was commissioned to work up his winning proposal. Unfortunately, however, Frey died suddenly on 3 August 1904, and it was left to his young assistant to carry the project through to completion. Christ Church was built between 1907 and 1911, following plans prepared by Christian Schrade. Although it was a very early work, it has come to be seen as his most important work. Schrade's later commissions were built in and around Mannheim. They included the GBG Apartment block in Garnisonstraße. His principal focus was on church buildings, however, although there was no return to the prewar exuberant optimism of the . His later churches, like the Christ Church, were almost all built for Evangelical congregations. Commissions included the (1936) in the Mannheim district and the (1950) in the city's Neuostheim quarter. Churches commissioned outside Mannheim included one in Steinsfurt and one in Brötzingen (Pforzheim). New church building in the second part of the twentieth century was supported by massive population transfers in 1944/46 from what had before 1945 been the north-eastern eastern part of Germany: the transfers had fueled population growth and increased the proportion of non-Catholic Christians in the south-west of the country. Another of Schrade's projects was the rebuilding of the Evangelical on the east side of central Mannheim. His proposal for the was never built, however. For the Trinity Church an uncompromisingly \"contemporary\" proposal from was preferred over Schrode's \"Baroque\n\n[10] Kirche am Steinhof: The Church of St. Leopold, better known as the Kirche am Steinhof, was built during the construction of the Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital (now the ), from 1904 to 1907. When drafting his plans for the building, the commissioned architect, Otto Wagner, respected the church's role as the institutional chapel for mentally ill patients and consulted with doctors and nurses concerning the specific requirements of such a building. On October 8, 1907, the church was opened by Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The Archduke and Wagner were at odds on a variety of issues, not least on the overall design of the church. The former had disapproved of Wagner's art nouveau style from the very beginning; so much so, in fact, that he refused to acknowledge Wagner during the opening ceremony or to commission any other work from the architect. But opinions regarding Wagner's unusual design were varied. In an article published in the New Free Press on October 6, 1907, the author rhetorically asked: \"And is it not a beautiful irony of fate, that the first sensible secessionist building in Vienna has been built for the insane?\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

General Motors of Canada did not file for bankruptcy. The United States and Canadian government control are reported as temporary. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler Group LLC emerged from a Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy and was sold to the Italian automaker Fiat. On June 3, 2011, Fiat bought out the remaining U.S. Treasury’s stake in Chrysler for $500 million, increasing its ownership of the automaker to 53%. On January 21, 2014, Fiat bought out the remaining stake in Chrysler Group that it did not already hold from the United Auto Workers' employee medical benefit retirement trust.\n\n[2] History of Chrysler: On May 24, 2011, Fiat paid back $7.6 billion in U.S. and Canadian government loans. On July 21, Fiat bought the Chrysler shares held by the United States Treasury. With the purchase, Chrysler once again became foreign owned; this time Italian car maker Fiat gained majority ownership and control of Chrysler. The United States government’s involvement in the Chrysler bankruptcy cost the U.S. taxpayer $1.3 billion.\n\n[3] Chrysler: Like the other Big Three automobile manufacturers, Chrysler was impacted by the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010. The company remained in business through a combination of negotiations with creditors, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on April 30, 2009, and participating in a bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 10, 2009, Chrysler emerged from the bankruptcy proceedings with the United Auto Workers pension fund, Fiat S.p.A., and the U.S. and Canadian governments as principal owners. The bankruptcy resulted in Chrysler defaulting on over $4 billion in debts. By May 24, 2011, Chrysler finished repaying its obligations to the U.S. government five years early, although the cost to the American taxpayer was $1.3 billion. Over the next few years, Fiat gradually acquired the other parties' shares while removing much of the weight of the loans (which carried a 21% interest rate) in a short period.\n\n[4] Fiat Industrial: Fiat Industrial S.p.A. was an Italian company into which Fiat S.p.A. (parent company of Fiat Group) demerged most of its activities not directly related to automobiles at the start of 2011. Fiat Industrial served as a holding company for the activities of truck manufacturer Iveco; an 89.3% stake in the agricultural and construction equipment producer CNH Global; and FPT Industrial, which consists of the industrial and marine activities formerly part of Fiat Powertrain Technologies. The company's Chairman was Sergio Marchionne, who also served as CEO of Fiat S.p.A. and Chairman/CEO of Chrysler Group LLC, now merged as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\n[5] Fiat Chrysler Automobiles: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (abbreviated as FCA) is an Italian and American multinational corporation and is the world’s eighth largest auto maker. The group was established in October 2014 by merging Fiat and Chrysler into a new holding company. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' main headquarters are located in the Netherlands, and the financial headquarters are in London for tax purposes. The holding company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Borsa Italiana in Milan. Exor N.V., an Italian investment group controlled by the Agnelli family, owns 29.19% of FCA and controls 44.31% through a loyalty voting mechanism.\n\n[6] Chrysler: Chrysler (; officially FCA US LLC) is one of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the United States, headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The original Chrysler Corporation was founded by Walter Chrysler from the remains of the Maxwell Motor Company in 1925. It was acquired by Daimler-Benz, and the holding company was renamed DaimlerChrysler, in 1998. After Daimler divested of Chrysler in 2007, the company existed as Chrysler LLC (2007–2009) and Chrysler Group LLC (2009–2014) before merging with Fiat S.p.A. and becoming a subsidiary of its successor Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in 2014. In addition to the flagship Chrysler brand, FCA sells vehicles worldwide under the Dodge, Jeep, and Ram nameplates. Furthermore, the subsidiary includes Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division.\n\n[7] Sergio Marchionne: Marchionne was widely recognized for turning around Fiat Group to become one of the fastest growing companies in the auto industry, in less than two years. In 2009, he was instrumental in Fiat Group forming a strategic alliance with the ailing US automaker Chrysler, with the support of the U.S. and Canadian governments and trade unions. Less than two years later, following its emergence from Chapter 11, Chrysler returned to profitability, repaying all government loans. In 2014, Fiat and Chrysler merged into a new holding company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, now the seventh-largest automobile manufacturer in the world.\n\n[8] FCA Canada Inc.: FCA Canada Inc., formerly Chrysler Canada, is the wholly owned subsidiary of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles operating in Canada. Incorporated in 1925, the Chrysler Corporation of Canada gained complete control of a Maxwell-Chalmers plant in Windsor, Ontario that had been used to manufacture some Chrysler models in the previous year. Initially called Chrysler Canada, Ltd, the name of the company changed to DaimlerChrysler Canada Inc following the merger of the two parent companies. In August 2007, the company was renamed Chrysler Canada Incorporated when Cerberus Capital Management purchased 80.1% of its parent company Chrysler LLC.\n\n[9] Indiana State Police Pension Trust v. Chrysler LLC: On Wednesday, June 10, 2009, the sale of most of Chrysler assets to \"New Chrysler\" (formally known as Chrysler Group LLC) was completed. As had been proposed, Fiat received equity in the New Chrysler through its contribution of automobile platforms as a base for a new line of Chrysler cars. The federal government financed the deal with the US$6.6 billion in financing that it had paid to the \"Old Chrysler\", formally called Chrysler LLC. The transfer did not include eight manufacturing locations, nor many parcels of real estate, nor equipment leases. Contracts with 789 U.S. auto dealerships, which are being dropped by Chrysler, were not transferred.\n\n[10] Dodge: On June 10, 2009, Italian automaker Fiat formed a partnership with Chrysler under Sergio Marchionne, with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a \"bridge loan\" or \"bailout\". The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio's plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2014. The combined company will be based in London.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He founded and edited \"Yojana\", an Indian government journal in 1951 -1953; \"The Illustrated Weekly of India\", a newsweekly; and two major Indian newspapers, \"The National Herald\" and the \"Hindustan Times\". During his tenure, \"The Illustrated Weekly\" became India's pre-eminent newsweekly, with its circulation raising from 65,000 to 400000. After working for nine years in the weekly, on 25 July 1978, a week before he was to retire, the management asked Singh to leave \"with immediate effect\". A new editor was installed the same day. After Singh's departure, the weekly suffered a huge drop in readership. In 2016 Khushwant Singh enters Limca Book of Records as a tribute.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

On December 30, 1956 about 4000 juveniles walked through Dortmund’s city, affronting passers-by, rampaging and having battles with the police, after a cinema show of \"Außer Rand und Band\" (\"Rock Around the Clock\" with Bill Haley) Big riots occurred especially from 1956 to 1958. Often, the furniture of cinemas and concert halls was totally destroyed. These riots started severe discussions in media and politics.  The seeming sense- and directionlessness of the riots wasn’t comprehensible. Often, the American popular culture was considered guilty. Nowadays, the riots and all of the Halbstarken-phenomenon is seen as a protest against society and its authorities which seemed draconic and bleak. But the protest was neither organized nor politically motivated.\n\n[2] Blackboard Jungle: The music led to a large teenage audience for the film, and their exuberant response to it sometimes overflowed into violence and vandalism at screenings. In this sense, the film has been seen as marking the start of a period of visible teenage rebellion in the latter half of the 20th century. The film was banned in Memphis, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia, with the Atlanta Review Board claiming that it was \"immoral, obscene, licentious and will adversely affect the peace, health, morals and good order of the city.\" The film marked a watershed in the United Kingdom and was originally refused a cinema certificate before being passed with heavy cuts. When shown at a South London Cinema in Elephant and Castle in 1956 the teenage Teddy Boy audience began to riot, tearing up seats and dancing in the aisles. After that, riots took place around the country wherever the film was shown. In 2007, the \"Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture\" published an article that analyzed the film's connection to crime theories and juvenile delinquency.\n\n[3] Abadan, Iran: Whereas Abadan was not a major cultural or religious centre, it did play an important role in the Islamic Revolution. On 19 August 1978 the anniversary of the US backed coup d'état which overthrew the nationalist and popular Iranian prime minister, Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh – the Cinema Rex, a movie theatre in Abadan, Iran, was set ablaze. The Cinema Rex Fire caused 430 deaths, but more importantly, it was another event that kept the Islamic Revolution moving ahead. At the time there was much confusion and misinformation about the perpetrators of the incident. The public largely put the blame on the local police chief and also the Shah and SAVAK. The reformist Sobhe Emrooz newspaper in one of its editorials revealed that the Cinema Rex was burned down by the radical Islamists. The newspaper was shut down immediately after. Over time, the true culprits, radical Islamists, were apprehended and the logic behind this act was revealed, as they were trying both to foment the general public to distrust the government even more, and also as they perceived cinema as a link to the Americans. This fire was one of four during a short period in August, with other fires in Mashhad, Rizaiya, and Shiraz.\n\n[4] Rang De Basanti: While such reactions were observed on the Internet, youth activism took to streets to protest on public interest issues. A direct impact was on the 1999 Jessica Lall Murder Case, one of the high-profile murder cases in India. A month after the film's release, a court acquitted the main accused because of inefficient prosecution and hostile witnesses. This sparked intense civil protests and media campaigns that sought his re-arrest. Taking cue from the scene in which the protagonists hold a silent, candlelight vigil at New Delhi's India Gate, one such group of demonstrators carried out a similar rally to voice their protest. Shortly thereafter, a survey was conducted to assess reasons for the sudden upsurge in people's social involvements. Eighteen percent of the respondents felt that movies like \"Rang De Basanti\" were the main reason behind it. Another such massive youth activism was seen in the Priyadarshini Mattoo rape and murder case where similar rallies were organised in India, United States and around the world. Following the release of the film, another social outcry was against the introduction of reservations for socially backward classes in educational institutions. Young doctors and engineers joined hands in peaceful rallies in major cities across India. Though the film was not released in the neighbouring Pakistan, it evoked similar reactions there. Inspired by the film, Pakistan's national newspaper, \"Jang\", launched a television channel that was to focus on citizens' issues and support public awakening. Reacting to these strong social reactions, actor Kunal Kapoor thought that the film was just a catalyst that presented \"patriotism in a package that the youngsters understood and empathised with\".\n\n[5] Parzania: The plot is based on the story of Rupa Mody, whose son went missing after the 2002 Gujarat riots. The ten-year-old Parzan disappears during these riots when their surrounding homes are attacked. Cyrus, Shernaz and Dilshad manage to escape the carnage. In the aftermath of the riots, Cyrus searches for his missing child while fighting for his own sanity. While assisting the Pithawalas in their search, Allan battles to uncover the reason behind the riots in an effort to make some sense of the incident. People start to question government's official explanation of the incident which downplays any conspiracy. As a result, a Human Rights Commission is formed. Through the commission, several witnesses and victims testify against the indifference of the police to protect them from the rioters. The film ends with a dedication to the victims of communal violence.In the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat, Los Angeles-based director Rahul Dholakia faced a personal tragedy. The riots left his friend's family shattered and this left an indelible mark on him. It hurt him all the more because the incidents happened in his home state. He felt responsible, both morally and socially, and wanted to speak up as a filmmaker. Most of the US$700,000 budget came from two of his Indian friends in the United States. Dholakia chose to make the film in English because he thought that communal riots was a global issue. Furthermore, he was unsure whether he could have the film released in India, given the sensitive nature of the film.\n\n[6] 1985 Gujarat riots: The 1985 Gujarat riots began in February and lasted till October 1986, in the city of Ahmedabad. The violence caused an estimated death toll of 275, thousands of injuries and tens of thousands displaced. According to Asghar Ali Engineer, the riots were organized by the Bharatiya Janata Party to cause the downfall of the government of Madhav Singh Solanki. Initially the riots were an intra Hindu caste issue over the reservations policy of the state government but this turned into a communal riot between Hindus and Muslims. The rioters had initially targeted state property but within a month began to target Muslims and Muslim owned property.\n\n[7] Ladrón de Cadáveres: On his website \"Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings\", Dave Sindelar gave the film a positive review, calling it \"one of the best of the Mexican horror movies\". Before the film's release in 1956, Mexican cinema was experiencing a decline and most critics dismissed the cinematic films of Mexico. Upon the release of two films directed by Fernando Mendez, the first being Ladrón de cadáveres which was released in 1956 and El vampiro in 1957. Both films were successful critically and financially and helped bring in the golden age of horror and fantasy films in Mexican cinema.\n\n[8] History of film: In 1950, the Lettrists avante-gardists caused riots at the Cannes Film Festival, when Isidore Isou's \"Treatise on Slime and Eternity\" was screened. After their criticism of Charlie Chaplin and split with the movement, the Ultra-Lettrists continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new hypergraphical techniques. The most notorious film is Guy Debord's \"Howls for Sade\" of 1952.\n\n[9] 1956 Cannes Film Festival: In an effort to resolve some issues caused by the Cold War climate of the time, like special treatment towards Americans (who gave financial assistance to the festival) which displeased the Eastern Block, a decision to have films withdrawn under certain conditions had been put in place. This decision in turn had become a divisive issue in the festival, as it was seen as censorship. In 1956 it was decided to eliminate all such censorship from the selection and thereby start a new era in the festival.\n\n[10] Nora Nicholson: Nicholson was in demand for television and cinema work. She is probably best known as Juley Forsyte in the BBC's \"The Forsyte Saga\" (1967). Earlier she had played Clarissa Spenlow in a serial adaptation of \"David Copperfield\" (1956) and Miss Flyte in \"Bleak House\" (1959). Her last television role was in 1973 as Catherine Alan in an adaptation of \"A Room with a View\". Her cinema films included \"Tread Softly\" (1952), \"Raising a Riot\" (1955), \"A Town Like Alice\" (1956), \"The Captain's Table\" (1959), \"Law and Disorder\" (1958), \"The Captain's Table\" (1959) and \"Say Hello to Yesterday\" (1970).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was first proven, informally, by Gottlob Frege in his \"Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik\" (\"The Foundations of Arithmetic\"), published in 1884, and proven more formally in his \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\" (\"Basic Laws of Arithmetic\"), published in two volumes, in 1893 and 1903. The theorem was re-discovered by Crispin Wright in the early 1980s and has since been the focus of significant work. It is at the core of the philosophy of mathematics known as neo-logicism (at least of the Scottish School variety).\n\n[2] Frege's theorem: In \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\" (1884), and later, in \"Basic Laws of Arithmetic\" (vol. 1, 1893; vol. 2, 1903), Frege attempted to derive all of the laws of arithmetic from axioms he asserted as logical (see logicism). Most of these axioms were carried over from his \"Begriffsschrift\"; the one truly new principle was one he called the Basic Law V (now known as the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension): the \"value-range\" of the function \"f\"(\"x\") is the same as the \"value-range\" of the function \"g\"(\"x\") if and only if ∀\"x\"[\"f\"(\"x\") = \"g\"(\"x\")]. However, not only did Basic Law V fail to be a logical proposition, but the resulting system proved to be inconsistent, because it was subject to Russell's paradox. The inconsistency in Frege's \"Grundgesetze\" overshadowed Frege's achievement: according to Edward Zalta, the \"Grundgesetze\" \"contains all the essential steps of a valid proof (in second-order logic) of the fundamental propositions of arithmetic from a single consistent principle.\" This achievement has become known as Frege's theorem.\n\n[3] Hume's principle: HP plays a central role in Gottlob Frege's philosophy of mathematics. Frege shows that HP and suitable definitions of arithmetical notions entail all axioms of what we now call second-order arithmetic. This result is known as Frege's theorem, which is the foundation for a philosophy of mathematics known as neo-logicism.\n\n[4] Gottlob Frege: A frequently noted example is that Aristotle's logic is unable to represent mathematical statements like Euclid's theorem, a fundamental statement of number theory that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Frege's \"conceptual notation\" however can represent such inferences. The analysis of logical concepts and the machinery of formalization that is essential to \"Principia Mathematica\" (3 vols., 1910–13) (by Bertrand Russell, 1872–1970, and Alfred North Whitehead, 1861–1947), to Russell's theory of descriptions, to Kurt Gödel's (1906–78) incompleteness theorems, and to Alfred Tarski's (1901–83) theory of truth, is ultimately due to Frege.\n\n[5] The Foundations of Arithmetic: Frege makes a distinction between particular numerical statements such as 1+1=2, and general statements such as a+b=b+a. The latter are statements true of numbers just as well as the former. Therefore, it is necessary to ask for a definition of the concept of number itself.  Frege investigates the possibility that number is determined in external things. He demonstrates how numbers function in natural language just as adjectives. \"This desk has 5 drawers\" is similar in form to \"This desk has green drawers\". The drawers being green is an objective fact, grounded in the external world. But this is not the case with 5. Frege argues that each drawer is on its own green, but not every drawer is 5. Frege urges us to remember that from this it does not follow that numbers may be subjective. Indeed, numbers are similar to colors at least in that both are wholly objective.  Frege tells us that we can convert number statements where number words appear adjectivally (e.g., 'there are four horses') into statements where number terms appear as singular terms ('the number of horses is four'). Frege recommends such translations because he takes numbers to be objects. It makes no sense to ask whether any objects fall under 4. After Frege gives some reasons for thinking that numbers are objects, he concludes that statements of numbers are assertions about concepts.\n\n[6] Analytic philosophy: Russell, during his early career, along with his collaborator Alfred North Whitehead, was much influenced by Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), who developed predicate logic, which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient Aristotelian logic. Frege was also influential as a philosopher of mathematics in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to Edmund Husserl's 1891 book \"Philosophie der Arithmetik\", which argued that the concept of the cardinal number derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them, Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the \"psychologism\" of Husserl's \"Philosophie\"). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in \"The Foundations of Arithmetic\" (1884) and \"The Basic Laws of Arithmetic\" (, 1893–1903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.\n\n[7] Frege's propositional calculus: The following theorems will aim to find the remaining nine axioms of standard PC within the \"theorem-space\" of Frege's PC, showing that the theory of standard PC is contained within the theory of Frege's PC.\n\n[8] Frege's propositional calculus: The next set of theorems will aim to find the remaining four axioms of Frege's PC within the \"theorem-space\" of standard PC, showing that the theory of Frege's PC is contained within the theory of standard PC.\n\n[9] Frege's theorem: In propositional logic, Frege's theorems refers to this tautology:\n\n[10] Field (mathematics): Fields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard general context for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Sickler is a three-time member of the USRowing senior national team and won gold medals with the women's eight at the 2006 and 2007 World Rowing Championships. She finished 12th in the women's double sculls at the 2006 world regatta and was a Team USA alternate for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Sickler graduated from the University of Michigan in 2005 and was the lead assistant coach from 2010–2012 where she helped coach the Wolverines to a second-place finish at the 2012 NCAA Championships and the 2012 Big Ten Championship title. She was named the assistant coach for the University of Virginia Rowing team in August 2012.\n\n[2] Brett Hull: Upon his arrival in the NHL, Hull was considered a \"one-dimensional player\". He was a natural goal scorer with a reputation for being uninterested in backchecking and playing defense. He was nicknamed \"The Incredible Hull\" (a reference to Bruce Banner) in college for his scoring exploits and was called \"The Golden Brett\" in the NHL, a play on his father's nickname of \"The Golden Jet\". Brett was often compared to Bobby in his early years, though the two shared few similarities on the ice. Both were known for their shooting ability, particularly the power of their slapshot, which Terry Crisp – who played against Bobby and coached Brett – described as \"explosive\", but while Bobby was a left wing known for both his conditioning and skating ability, Brett played right wing, was a poorer skater and lacked his father's physique.\n\n[3] Jay Larson: Guests would often leave Sickler and Larson laughing uncontrollably. Many of the show’s growing audience would remark on Ryan Sickler’s iconic laugh as a reason for tuning in each Tuesday or as it was later known,”Toozdee”.\n\n[4] Brett Sports F.C.: The club began life as the works team for Robert Brett & Sons, an engineering company based in the Wincheap district of Canterbury. The team played at a ground which had existed since at least 1906, but which Bretts had taken over during the inter-war years, and played in the Kent Amateur League prior to the Second World War. Immediately after the war, Bretts were considered the leading team in the city. In 1947 the newly formed Canterbury City team were permitted to share the ground, known as Bretts Corner, where they continued to play until 1958.\n\n[5] Sicklers Mountain: Sicklers Mountain is a mountain located in the Catskill Mountains of New York north-northwest of Windham. Stevens Mountain is located northwest, and Mount Royal is located west of Sicklers Mountain.\n\n[6] Thomas Brett (cricketer): Thomas Brett (1747 – 31 December 1809) was one of cricket's earliest well-known fast bowlers and a leading player for Hampshire when its team was organised by the Hambledon Club in the 1770s. Noted for his pace and his accuracy, Brett was a leading wicket-taker in the 1770s and was lauded by John Nyren in \"The Cricketers of my Time\". Writing half a century later, Nyren described Brett as \"beyond all comparison, the fastest as well as straitest bowler that ever was known\".\n\n[7] Sickler: Sickler may refer to:\n\n[8] Brett Beyer: Beyer is known for a high standard of sportsmanship and athleticism, putting in many hours in practice sailing sessions and running innovative coaching programs. Beyer has achieved much success in the World Laser Masters Championship with ten gold medals, two silver and one bronze in the Apprentice and Master divisions since 2001. Brett Beyer has produced and lectured Level 2 and 3 coaching courses with an emphasis on the physiology involved in competitive sailing as well as the complex tactical strategies required for success. Brett has also contributed to ISAF Olympic Solidarity Courses around the world designed to assist developing nations to have sailing exposure.\n\n[9] Brett Sutter: Brett Darryl Sutter (born June 2, 1987) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He is currently playing with the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League (AHL). Sutter was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the 6th round (179th overall) of the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. He made his NHL debut for the Flames during the 2008–09 season, scoring a goal in his first game. He is the son of former Los Angeles Kings head coach Darryl Sutter, and the one of nine members of the famous Sutter family to play in the NHL.\n\n[10] Brett Williams (defensive lineman): Brett \"the Toaster\" Williams (born May 23, 1958 in Norfolk, Virginia) is a former Canadian Football League defensive end who played ten seasons for five different teams, as well as in the now defunct USFL, with Birmingham and Memphis. He was a CFL All-Star three times. He was nicknamed \"the Toaster\" because he also played offense in short yardage situations, thus he would \"burn you on both sides\" (of the football).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was built by Peter Madsen and Claus Nørregaard in 2001–2002, as a demonstrator to try submarine technology. Having made over 500 dives, it was decommissioned, as it was not designed for a long service life. It was decommissioned in 2006 after \"UC2 Kraka\" had been worked up. The submarine was then docked and allowed to decay. Final decontamination was done, and it was towed out to sea by \"UC3 Nautilus\", in August 2008, and sunk as an artificial reef near Copenhagen. \"Freya\" is named after the Norse goddess of fertility and love.\n\n[2] UC1 Freya: The sub was built at Peter Madsen's workshop in Farum, Denmark. \"Freya\" was completed in 2002. It was built with only an electric drive, a 3.1-kW Sauer-Danfoss 24V DC electric motor. Coupled with a 24V 200Ah Setronic-Flamm GS gel battery, this gave a range of , but a charging time of 24 hours. This gave a cruise radius of . The electric motor was sourced from a forklift. The sub had a service depth of , and a theoretical crush depth of . The sub was long, wide, and tall from keel to top of periscope. It could reach on the surface or submerged. \"Freya\" was not equipped with an air compressor, which limited the time length of dives. The sub could hold 2 people. As \"UC1\" was a prototype, it was built out of regular steel, for enhanced strength, over aluminum or fibreglass, and making it cheaper than stainless steel. Operating costs originally were about 6 DKK worth of electricity for a couple of hours cruising.\n\n[3] Peter Madsen: Madsen built three submarines: \"UC1 Freya\", \"UC2 Kraka\" and \"UC3 Nautilus\". The \"Nautilus\" is a privately built midget submarine, launched on 3 May 2008 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Constructed over three years, it cost approximately US$200,000 to build (1.5 million DKK).\n\n[4] UC1 Freya: \"Freya\" was completed in 2002, and she was put to sea, starting voyages. In July 2002, out of the water for inspection and refit, it was crushed by a transport accident, when the truck it was on passed under a low bridge, and the attached crane was knocked over, crushing the conning tower and central portion. Insurance monies paid by the transport company were used to pay for repairs, making it seaworthy again, later in 2002. The repairs were done by Madsen and company.\n\n[5] FuG 25a Erstling: Built by the GEMA company, who also designed the Freya radar, the basic concept had been introduced in November 1938, but little work was carried out on it initially. The \"Luftwaffes Chief of Signals placed an order for 2,000 to 3,000 units in late 1939, although the prototype was not available until 1941. The system only responded to the Freya, a serious limitation as the Würzburg radar became more widely used. This was addressed starting in July 1942 by equipping Würzburg units with a separate Kuh\"' unit that broadcast pulses on Freya's 2.5 m band.\n\n[6] UC1 Freya: After decommissioning, it was sunk to the bottom of the Øresund.\n\n[7] SMS Freya (1874): SMS \"Freya\" was a steam corvette of the German \"Kaiserliche Marine\" (Imperial Navy). She was the third member of the , which included two other ships, and . Ordered as part of a large naval expansion program after the Austro-Prussian War, she was laid down in 1872 after the Franco-Prussian War. She was launched in December 1874 and completed in October 1876. \"Freya\" was built to a different design than her sisters, being longer and carrying a heavier armament of twelve guns.\n\n[8] Holden Dealer Team: In 1972, Harry Firth began developing a V8-engined version of the LJ Torana GTR XU-1, to be able to compete with Ford's anticipated XA Falcon GT-HO (Phase IV) and Chrysler's mooted 340 cui V8 Charger at Bathurst (Chrysler continue to this day to say that the Charger R/T V8 was a myth and that their intention was to continue with the 265 cui Hemi-6, but Ford's GT-HO Phase IV was no myth as 4 examples were built with two surviving as of 2015). The first V8 Torana was fitted with the small block 253 cui (4.2L) V8, but this was soon upgraded to the 308 cui (5.0L) version. This car was built to Series Production rules at the time but Harry Firth had Colin Bond race the car, disguised as a Sports Sedan, at the 1972 Easter ATCC race meeting at Bathurst. Bond took an easy victory in the five lap support race with a lap time some four seconds faster than the team's 6-cylinder Series car ran on the same day. Production plans were terminated following the 'Supercar scare' of June/July 1972.\n\n[9] SMS Freya: SMS \"Freya\" was a protected cruiser of the , built for the German Imperial Navy (\"Kaiserliche Marine\") in the 1890s, along with her sister ships , , , and . \"Freya\" was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig in 1895, launched in April 1897, and commissioned into the Navy in October 1898. The ship was armed with a battery of two 21 cm guns and eight 15 cm guns and had a top speed of .\n\n[10] SMS Freya (1874): The three \"Ariadne\"-class corvettes were ordered as part of the fleet plan of 1867, an expansion program aimed at strengthening the Prussian Navy in the wake of the Austro-Prussian War. The plan called for a total of twenty screw corvettes. The design for \"Freya\" was prepared in 1871 as a lengthened version of her half-sisters; the increased size of the ship was used to improve coal storage (and thus her cruising range) and strengthen her armament.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The character was created by Gardner Fox (writer) and Mike Sekowsky (penciller), and made his first appearance in \"The Brave and the Bold\" in February 1960. From 1960 to 1969, Snapper Carr appeared as a supporting character to the Justice League of America, a superhero team. The character occasionally appeared in comics featuring the Justice League from 1969 to 1989, when the \"Invasion!\" limited-series comic book gave him superpowers. He was associated with a new superhero team, The Blasters, in various comics until 1993, when he lost his powers and became a main character in the \"Hourman\" comic book. After the cancellation of \"Hourman\" in April 2001, he became a main character in the \"Young Justice\" comic book beginning in December 2001. \"Young Justice\" was cancelled in May 2003, and he became associated with the governmental organization Checkmate, a role revealed when the character played a small but important role in the 2007-2008 limited series comic book \"52 Aftermath: The Four Horsemen\". The character made major appearances in \"Final Crisis: Resist\" in December 2008 and \"Justice League of America 80-Page Giant\" in November 2009.\n\n[2] Snapper Carr: In the 1985–1986 crossover \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", DC Comics rebooted its fictional universe and the back-stories of nearly all its characters. This required retellings of many of origin stories, including that of the Justice League of America. The first adventures of the Justice League, and that of Snapper Carr, were retold in the 12-issue maxi-series comic book \"JLA: Year One\". The first several issues of the maxi-series involved the alien race known as the Appellaxians, which had first appeared in \"Justice League of America\" Vol. 1 #9 (February 1962). In the fictional character chronology, this story occurs before and shortly after \"The Brave and the Bold\" #28, but in the publication history of the character it is printed in 1998. In the story, the Appellaxians conspired with a new criminal organization, Locus, to take over Earth. Snapper's uncle, Simon Carr, made his first appearance in the second issue, and in the third issue readers learned that Simon is the contact person for an ultra-wealthy individual (later revealed to be Oliver Queen) who wishes to financially support the Justice League in its mission. Simon introduced the League to college student and genius inventor Ted Kord (who is also the superhero Blue Beetle), who provided them with some technology, and to his nephew, Snapper. The adventure with Starro took place between \"JLA: Year One\" issues #3 and #4, and Snapper played a critical role in issue #9 in alerting the League to the Appellaxian attack on Earth. In issue #10, he deduced that his uncle had been possessed by the Appellaxian leader, and had the League defeat Simon and then free him from alien control.\n\n[3] Snapper Carr: The Snapper Carr character appeared again in 1999 in the comic book \"Legends of the DC Universe\". In the fictional character chronology, this story occurs some time after Green Arrow's 1980 resignation from the Justice League, but before Green Arrow rejoins the League in 1989. In this story (\"Critical Mass Stages 1-5\"/\"Critical Mass Stages 6-16\"), Snapper witnesses five JLA members growing to monstrous size. He believes this is a side-effect of a long-ago attack by a minor villain named Packrat. Snapper finds Green Arrow, who locates Packrat's shrink ray and restores the heroes to their correct size. As Snapper departs, Green Arrow tells the boy that he needs to forgive himself.\n\n[4] Snapper Carr: The Snapper Carr character made a number of appearances in \"The Superman Family\" comic book from 1978 to 1982. Superman gets Snapper at job at S.T.A.R. Labs, the fictional nonprofit research corporation devoted to creating high-tech weapons and prisons to handle various supervillain and alien menaces. Snapper surreptitiously stole the wreck of a Kryptonian space-sled in the story \"Birthright of Power!\", and briefly appeared in the story \"Kandor vs. Supergirl\" as a witness at the trial of Supergirl. He helped defend her in the follow-on story by gathering letters of recommendation from Justice League members, and then was hired as an assistant by Supergirl's foster father, Fred Danvers. Three issues later, he made a brief appearance in the Supergirl story \"What Goes Up Can't Come Down\" and its conclusion \"The Gravity War\". At the end of \"Nightmare in New Athens\", Snapper is shown to have used the space-sled to fix a Superboy robot, but a disembodied intelligence takes control of the android. In \"The Screamin' Demon\", readers learn that student teacher Paul French has tried to wipe the memories of his criminal past by developing a \"transistorized brain\". Somehow, it all went wrong, and while he slept his unconscious mind seized control of the robot. (Supergirl briefly battled the robot before Paul woke.)\n\n[5] Snapper Carr: The character of Snapper Carr is a main character in the \"Hourman\" comic book, which was published from April 1999 to April 2001. Throughout the comic book's run, a running gag depicts Snapper wearing a series of T-shirts, each emblazoned with a different superhero's logo or uniform colors. In this comic book, Hourman III is an android from the 853rd century. He was built by Tyler ChemoRobotics, a company founded by Hourman II (Rick Tyler) in the late 20th century. Hourman III traveled permanently to the 20th century, which is the one place he believed he could grow and evolve as a lifeform. He joined the Justice League, and at one point accessed all of Batman's memories of the League. These memories made Hourman III realize that Snapper Carr would be a good \"humanity coach\". The reader learns that, after having his hands restored, Snapper returned to Earth. He married and was divorced by a young woman named Bethany Lee (whose mother is the Happy Harbor chief of police). Snapper is depicted spending most of his time at a trendy if run-down Happy Harbor coffeehouse, the Mad Yak Café, and caring for his pet cat, whom he has named Starro.\n\n[6] Snapper Foster: Snapper Foster is a fictional character on the CBS daytime soap opera \"The Young and the Restless\". An original character since the show's inception, the role was played by William Gray Espy from March 26, 1973 to July 1975, and David Hasselhoff from 1975 to May 1982. Espy briefly reprised the character from February 28, 2003 to March 5, 2003, and Hasselhoff briefly reprised the role from June 15–21, 2010.\n\n[7] Snapper Carr: As written by Gardner Fox, Snapper Carr had the most distinctive personality of all the members of the Justice League. Fox's writing focused on action, not character, and the dialogue he gave his superheroes was so bland as to be interchangeable among the characters. Snapper not only had the most distinctive means of speaking (with his extreme hipster slang), but he had the most clearly written and individualist character of all the recurring characters in the comic book. Within a few years, Fox got rid of the hipster slang and had Snapper speak in a more mainstream way, which had the side-effect of giving the character no discernible personality.\n\n[8] Snapper Carr: Ellsworth specifically coined the name \"Snapper Carr\", the character's first name indicating his habit of snapping his fingers when excited or making a point. Snapper's given name of Lucas was not revealed until 1978.\n\n[9] Snapper Carr: Snapper's parents are identified in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #28 as Mr. and Mrs. John Carr. Two years later, readers learn in 1961 that he has a younger brother, Jimmy Carr. Snapper Carr was given a girlfriend, Midge, in \"Justice League of America\" Vol. 1 #7 (November 1961). Snapper was also shown in 1974 to have a sister, Janet. In 1998, readers learned that Snapper had an uncle, Simon Carr, who played a major role in the founding of the Justice League. A year later, Snapper mentioned in \"Hourman\" #1 that he has a brother nicknamed \"Spitter\" Carr (for his habit of spitting). (It is unclear if Spitter and Jimmy are the same person, or if Snapper was merely being sarcastic.)\n\n[10] Snapper Carr: By the time the story \"Snapper Carr—Super Traitor!\" appeared, the Snapper Carr character had not been present in any Justice League of America stories for some time. The story begins with Snapper shown to be upset by the fact that people are interested in him only because of what he knows about the Justice League, and not because he is a hero in his own right. He is confronted by John Dough, \"the most average man in America\", who wants to rid the world of superheroes. Snapper helps Dough kidnap Batman, and addresses a public rally condemning superheroes. The crowd riots, and the Justice League members (except for new member Black Canary) lose control of their powers. After a fake Batman attacks people attending a congressional hearing into causes of the riot, Snapper resigns his honorary membership in the Justice League. When the League returns to its Secret Sanctuary (located in a seaside cave near Happy Harbor), they're attacked by Dough—who turns out to be the Joker. Joker reveals that Snapper told \"John Dough\" the location of the League's Secret Sanctuary. The League captures the Joker, but Snapper has departed.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhen referring to a cash machine, what does ‘ATM’ stand for?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Timeline of United States inventions (1890–1945): An automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of accounts may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an ATM card. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor Luther George Simjian initially came up with the idea of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.\n\n[2] Chemical Bank: Chemical was among the pioneers of electronic online banking. On September 2, 1969, Chemical installed the first automated teller machine (ATM) at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card. A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted \"On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\" Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller, was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines. Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.\n\n[3] ATM card: An ATM card is a payment card or dedicated payment card issued by a financial institution which enables a customer to access automated teller machines (ATMs). ATM cards are payment card size and style plastic cards with a magnetic stripe or a plastic smart card with a chip that contains a unique card number and some security information such as an expiration date or CVVC (CVV). ATM cards are known by a variety of names such as bank card, MAC (money access card), client card, key card or cash card, among others. Most payment cards, such as debit and credit cards can also function as ATM cards, although ATM-only cards are also available. Charge and proprietary cards cannot be used as ATM cards. The use of a credit card to withdraw cash at an ATM is treated differently to a POS transaction, usually attracting interest charges from the date of the cash withdrawal. Interbank networks allow the use of ATM cards at ATMs of private operators and financial institutions other than those of the institution that issued the cards.\n\n[4] Automated teller machine: ATMs are known by a variety of names, including automatic teller machine in the United States (ATM, American, British, Australian, Malaysian, South African, Singaporean, Indian, Maldivian, Hiberno, Philippines and Sri Lankan English), often redundantly ATM machine, automated banking machine (ABM, Canadian English). Although ABM is used in Canada, ATM is still very commonly used in Canada and many Canadian organization used ATM over ABM. In British English, the terms cash point, cash machine, minibank (the official name of the Yorkshire bank ATMs), and \"hole in the wall\" are most widely used. Other terms include any time money, cashline, nibank, tyme machine, cash dispenser, bankomat or bancomat. Many ATMs have a sign above them, indicating the name of the bank or organisation that owns the ATM, and possibly including the networks to which it can connect. In Canada, ABMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as \"white-label ABMs\".\n\n[5] Automated teller machine: The first modern ATM was an IBM 2984 and came into use at Lloyds Bank, High Street, Brentwood, Essex, the UK in December 1972. The IBM 2984 was designed at the request of Lloyds Bank. The 2984 Cash Issuing Terminal was the first true ATM, similar in function to today's machines and named by Lloyds Bank: Cashpoint. Cashpoint is still a registered trademark of Lloyds Banking Group in the UK but is often used as a generic trademark to refer to ATMs of all UK banks. All were online and issued a variable amount which was immediately deducted from the account. A small number of 2984s were supplied to a U.S. bank. A couple of well known historical models of ATMs include the IBM 3614, IBM 3624 and 473x series, Diebold 10xx and TABS 9000 series, NCR 1780 and earlier NCR 770 series.\n\n[6] Automated teller machine: On September 2, 1969, Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card. A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted \"On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\" Chemical's ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines. Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money. In 1995, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History recognised Docutel and Wetzel as the inventors of the networked ATM.\n\n[7] Automated teller machine: Increasingly, banks are seeking to use the ATM as a sales device to deliver pre approved loans and targeted advertising using products such as ITM (the Intelligent Teller Machine) from Aptra Relate from NCR. ATMs can also act as an advertising channel for other companies.* However, several different ATM technologies have not yet reached worldwide acceptance, such as: Videoconferencing teller machines are currently referred to as Interactive Teller Machines. Benton Smith, in the Idaho Business Review writes \"The software that allows interactive teller machines to function was created by a Salt Lake City-based company called uGenius, a producer of video banking software. NCR, a leading manufacturer of ATMs, acquired uGenius in 2013 and married its own ATM hardware with uGenius' video software.\"  Before an ATM is placed in a public place, it typically has undergone extensive testing with both test money and the backend computer systems that allow it to perform transactions. Banking customers also have come to expect high reliability in their ATMs, which provides incentives to ATM providers to minimise machine and network failures. Financial consequences of incorrect machine operation also provide high degrees of incentive to minimise malfunctions.\n\n[8] History of banking in the United States: On September 2, 1969, Chemical Bank installed the first ATM in the U.S. at its branch in Rockville Centre, New York. The first ATMs were designed to dispense a fixed amount of cash when a user inserted a specially coded card. A Chemical Bank advertisement boasted \"On Sept. 2 our bank will open at 9:00 and never close again.\" Chemicals' ATM, initially known as a Docuteller was designed by Donald Wetzel and his company Docutel. Chemical executives were initially hesitant about the electronic banking transition given the high cost of the early machines. Additionally, executives were concerned that customers would resist having machines handling their money.\n\n[9] Bitcoin ATM: There are two main types of Bitcoin machines: cash kiosks and ATMs. Both types are connected to the Internet, allowing for cash or debit card payment, respectively, in exchange for bitcoins given as a paper receipt or by moving money to a public key on the blockchain. Bitcoin cash kiosks look like traditional ATMs, but do not connect to a bank account and instead connect the user directly to a Bitcoin exchange. Bitcoin-enabled ATMs are traditional ATMs and connect to a bank account to allow for a cashless purchase of bitcoin. According to an advisory issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \"they may also charge high transaction fees – media reports describe transaction fees as high as 7% and exchange rates $50 over rates you could get elsewhere\".\n\n[10] Payment card: All ATM machines, at a minimum, will permit cash withdrawals of customers of the machine's owner (if a bank-operated machine) and for cards that are affiliated with any ATM network the machine is also affiliated. They will report the amount of the withdrawal and any fees charged by the machine on the receipt. Most banks and credit unions will permit routine account-related banking transactions at the bank's own ATM, including deposits, checking the balance of an account, and transferring money between accounts. Some may provide additional services, such as selling postage stamps.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He came from Callatis Pontica, as we learn from a Herculaneum papyrus. He lived earlier than the reign of Ptolemy VI Philometor (181–146 BC) when his \"Lives\" were epitomized by Heraclides Lembus, probably during the 3rd century BC. Athenaeus frequently refers to him as a Peripatetic, but his connection to the Peripatetic school is otherwise unknown. His biographies dealt with many eminent people including kings (Dionysius the Younger, Philip), statesmen (Alcibiades), orators (Demosthenes), poets (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides), and philosophers (Bias of Priene, Chilon of Sparta, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Zeno of Elea, Anaxagoras, Socrates, Diogenes, Anaxarchus, Stilpo). He also wrote on the population of Alexandria, and a work \"On Characters\" (). Fragments of his biography of the Athenian dramatist Euripides were found at the end of a papyrus scroll discovered at Oxyrhynchus in the early twentieth century.\n\n[2] Satyrus (ape): Satyrus (also known as callitrix or cericopithicus) is a species of ape described in some medieval bestiaries. It is said to always give birth to twins. Of these twins, it hates one, but loves the other. The ape is also described as lively and having a pleasant face. The satyrus was one of many creatures from folklore included in early editions of Carl Linnaeus' \"Systema Naturae\", alongside other legendary creatures, under the wastebasket taxon of \"Animalia Paradoxa\". In translation, Linneaus is quoted as saying that the satyrus is \"hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen.\"\n\n[3] Bosporan Kingdom: Satyrus (431 – 387 BC), successor to Spartocus, established his rule over the whole region, adding Nymphaeum to his kingdom and besieging Theodosia, which was wealthy because, unlike other cities in the region, it had a port which was free of ice throughout the year, allowing it to trade grain with the rest of the Greek world, even in winter. Satyrus' son Leucon (387 – 347 BC) eventually took the city. He was succeeded jointly by his two sons, Spartocus II, and Paerisades; Spartocus died in 342, allowing Paerisades to reign alone until 310. After Paerisades' death, a civil war between his sons Satyrus and Eumelus was fought. Satyrus defeated his younger brother Eumelus at the Battle of the River Thatis in 310 BC but was then killed in battle, giving Eumelus the throne.\n\n[4] Battle of the River Thatis: After crossing the river, Satyrus began to cut down the woods to clear the route for an attack on the city's walls. Aripharnes sent archers to both sides of the passage to shoot the men who cut down the trees, causing some casualties. A passage to the wall was cleared after three days work. On the fourth day the army of Satyrus assaulted the walls, but the resistance by the defenders was heavy. The attackers suffered heavy losses due to arrow fire from the walls and the confined space. When Meniscus, the leader of his mercenaries, was endangered in the fight, Satyrus moved in personally to support him. During the fight Satyrus was seriously wounded when he was stabbed in the upper arm with a spear. He retreated to his camp, where he died that night, after being king for nine months.\n\n[5] Callatis Club: Callatis Club is a post-festival show aired every year during the Callatis Festival on the Romanian TV channel TVR 2. The show was hosted in 2006 by Cătălin Măruță, and by Leonard Miron in 2008 and most of the singers who performed on the stage of the festival are invited.\n\n[6] Satyros I: Satyros I (died 389 BC) also known as Satyrus (Greek:Σάτυρος A') was the Spartocid ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom from 432 BC to 389 BC. During his rule he built upon the expansive foreign policy of his father, Spartokos I. He conquered Nymphaion, became involved in the political developments of the neighbouring Sindike kingdom and laid siege to the city of Theodosia, which was a serious commercial rival because of its ice-free port and proximity to the grain fields of eastern Crimea.\n\n[7] Bosporan Civil War: After the routing of their army, Aripharnes and Eumelos fled to Siracena, the Siracen capital and fortified city. Satyrus gave chase to his brother, but made the observations that the city was situated on the river Thatis, it was surrounded by thick forests and long cliffs and only had two artificial entry ways: one through the main gate, and another through the palace of Aripharnes, both of which were heavily defended. Knowing that it would be suicide to attack the main city, Satyrus decided to let his army plunder the nearby villages and attained from this many prisoners. Satyrus then ordered some of his men to start cutting some trees to make a pathway from their camp, to the main gate. While this was carried out, Aripharnes believed that the only way of safety was victory and stationed archers on both sides of his city. Satyrus's men, while cutting the trees, started to take fire from Siracen wall defenders, who were throwing spears and arrows at them. After four days of cutting, on the fourth day, his army made it to the Siracen walls, but had sustained many losses getting there. Meniscus, the mercenary Greek captain, fought with bravery and boldness when he entered the city, but had to retreat when he was overcome by enemy forces. Upon seeing this, Satyrus rushed to his aid and fought bravely, but was struck in his right shoulder by a spear and was carried back to his tent. Satyrus died that night. Meniscus, seeing no point in carrying out the siege, ended it and took Satyrus's body to Gargaza to be sent off to Panticapaeum.\n\n[8] Dionysius of Heraclea: When Clearchus died (353/352 BC), he was first succeeded by his brother Satyrus, who reigned as guardian for Clearchus' sons, Timotheus and Dionysius. Satyrus was succeeded by Timotheus, who soon shared power with his younger brother Dionysius. After the death of the Timotheus, Dionysius became the sole ruler of Heraclea (in 337/336 BC).\n\n[9] Satyrus (genus): Satyrus is a genus of butterflies from the subfamily Satyrinae in the family Nymphalidae. The species in the genus \"Satyrus\" occur in Europe and North Africa.\n\n[10] Callatis Festival: From 1999 to 2003, the hosts of the Callatis Festival changed every year. Since 2004, the organizers have opted for continuity, so the permanent festival hosts are Gabriel Cotabiţă and Sorana Belciu. Callatis Club, the after-show of the festival, was hosted in 2006 by Cătălin Măruță. In 2006, Sorana Belciu was replaced by two young presenters selected in the Miss Diaspora contest. After a year's break, Callatis Club returned to Romanian Television in 2008, presented by Leonard Miron.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is the first Sinhalese film which was fully shot in Ceylon and was the first in the country to be shot outdoors. It was also the first film which was free from Indian influence. Many Sinhalese films produced in that era were remakes of South Indian films which were not properly adapted to the Sri Lankan context. Even their dialogs were not natural.\n\n[2] Media of Sri Lanka: In the first nine years most films were made in South India and followed the conventions of Indian cinema. Studio shooting was the norm, with Indian style sets erected in film studios. Even though it is popularly held that \"Rekava\", made in 1956 by pioneer director Lester James Peries, was the first Sinhala film to be shot completely out of studio, it was really the film \"Gambada Sundari\", made in 1950 which was the first film shot outside studios. It was also the first Sri Lankan film where, like in \"Rekawa\", the dialog was recorded on the spot. This was because the film was shot on 16mm, using an Auricon sound-on-film camera which recorded the sound on the 16mm film optically, unlike in the case of where the sound was recorded on a Kinevox 35mm magnetic recorder. The film was later 'blown-up' to 35mm and was screened in Colombo in 1950.\n\n[3] Earliest color films in South India: \"Bhaktha Chetha\", a 1940 Tamil language film directed and produced by Krishnaswami Subrahmanyam, contained sequences which were hand-coloured. This is known to be the earliest Tamil film to have scenes in color. This process colourises film shot originally in black and white by colouring the negatives frame by frame.\n\n[4] Earliest color films in South India: \"Lava Kusa\" is a 1963 Indian bilingual Tamil Telugu Hindu mythological film, directed by C. S. Rao and his son C. Pullaiah. Shot and released entirely in Gevacolor, it is believed to be Telugu cinema's first only full length Gevacolor film. It was also the last Gevacolor film in Tamil. Gevacolor was replaced by Eastmancolor, which produced long-lasting color prints.\n\n[5] Earliest color films in South India: \"Allauddin Adhbhuta Deepam\" (1957) was Telugu cinema's first film to have a color sequence. The song \"Andhaala Konaetilona\" (the last sequence of the film) was shot in Gevacolor. \"Appu Chesi Pappu Koodu\" (1959) had a dance sequence by E. V. Saroja in color. In 1960, \"Runanubandham\" had its first 15 minutes in Gevacolor. \"Aaraadhana\", a 1962 film starring Akkineni Nageshwara Rao and Savithri, had a song sequence, \"Ohoho Maavayya\", in Gevacolor. \"Lava Kusa\" (1963), Telugu cinema's first full length color film, was the last Telugu film to be shot in Gevacolor. Later, Telugu color films were shot in Eastmancolor.\n\n[6] Earliest color films in South India: \"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum\" made history in Tamil cinema by being the first Tamil film to be entirely shot and released in Gevacolor. It was also the first full length colour film released in South India. A production of Modern Theatres and released in 1956, the film starred M. G. Ramachandran and Bhanumathi Ramakrishna in lead roles. This film was a swashbuckler which is still remembered by the current generation. \"Marma Veeran\", released in the same year, is believed to contain sequences in Gevacolor.\n\n[7] List of Nepalese films: The first Nepali-language film was \"Satya Harischandra\", which was released in 1951 in Darjeeling, India, and produced by D. B. Pariyar. The first Nepali-language movie made in Nepal was \"Aama\", which was released in 1964 produced by the Nepalese government. However, the first Nepali-language movie made by the Nepalese private sector was \"Maitighar\", which starred Mala Sinha and was released in 1966. The first color Nepali-language movie was \"Kumari\".\n\n[8] Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum (1956 film): Dancer and writer Lakshmi Viswanathan, who saw the film during its original release in 1956 at the Chennai-based Chitra theatre, wrote for \"The Hindu\" 2012, \"We children could not contain our excitement when the first colour film in Tamil ... was released in Chitra. We saw it again and again with the thrill that only children of those days could experience.\" Sachi Sri Kantha felt that the Gevacolor looked somewhat \"washed out\" and \"inferior\" to other colouring processes like Eastmancolor and versions of Fujicolor. He said the film succeeded with the Tamil masses because \"it was a first time experience they could enjoy the [colour] in totality.

But, being illiterate, [the] majority wouldn't have comprehended the dialogues and songs in English.\" In 2015, Karan Bali wrote for Scroll.in that the film \"blended melodious songs, exciting fighting scenes and a suspenseful climax\", and praised Veerappa's performance as Abu Hussain.

It was the first Tamil film to be exhibited in Poland with a dubbed version. In a review dated 28 January 1962, \"The Indian Express\" said, \"\"Konjum Salangai\", the first Technicolor feature film of South India is a revealing experience that even our technicians can bring out in a film the rich, glossy sheen and pleasing tonal gradations comparable with that of any Technicolor product made abroad.\"\n\n[10] Earliest color films in South India: \"Veerapandiya Kattabomman\" is a 1959 Indian Tamil-language biographical war film directed by B. R. Panthulu which was entirely shot in Gevacolor and released its prints in Technicolor. It had a very good color preservation although it was shot in Gevacolor. This is because of its prints released in Technicolor. It was expensive at that time to shoot a film entirely in Technicolor. This method helped the film's color not to fade compared to other Gevacolor film such as \"Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum\", whose colour has faded badly. \"Veerapandiya Kattabomman\" is the first Tamil film to release its prints in Technicolor.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

She had a series of dramatic visions between 1384 and 1386 and attempted to intervene in the politics of her time. The turning point of Constance's life was when she took a trip to Toulouse. Leaving Rabastens and taking a trip to Toulouse made herself known to the ecclesiastical authorities that became aware of her visionary activities. Unfortunately, there are no traces of herself other than her visions and the letters she wrote to the inquisitor of Toulouse. There are no documents mentioning her and there are no traces of her in the works of other authors. The little we know about Constance is that she had a daughter, a son who is a Benedictine monk in Toulouse, and a husband. Constance became a widow as she lost her husband during early forties and, at one point, she was in prison. There is nothing more heard of Constance after 1386.\n\n[2] Constance de Rabastens: Constance de Rabastens (13??-1386) was one of the female visionaries who concerned herself with politics in the late fourteenth century.: Many visionaries emerged in the late fourteenth century that predicted the future of the Church. Visionaries often claimed that their visions came from God and that the Church should listen to what is being told. Unlike Catherine of Siena and , other visionaries of the Great Schism, Constance was denied any official recognition and Constance at one point had to extract herself from an inquisitorial interrogation only with great difficulty. During the Great Schism there were multiple popes, the pope and the antipope, and Constance's denial of any official recognition was because she endorsed the \"wrong\" pope through her divinely inspired prophetic pronouncements. Little is known about Constance's life as her confessor, Raymond de Sabanac (law professor at the University of Toulouse), decided not to write about her life and decided to only write about her visions. Although there are not much known about Constance's life, there are documents about her visions and the letters she wrote to the inquisitor of Toulouse that are preserved in a Catalan translation in Bibliothèque nationale de France. Most of Constance's visions were put together by her confessor, Raymond de Sabanac, but some series of visions were transmitted to Raymond by Constance's son.\n\n[3] Constance de Rabastens: Constance's visions started in 1384 as her husband faced death. Her first vision was a crowd of dead people accompanied by the voice with great mortality and her husband died shortly afterwards. Constance is called as \"a sinful woman\" by Christ but despite the sinfulness and her inability to read, she interpreted the scriptures to learned men as she received divine interventions. Most of Constance's visions were Christ appearing and encouraging her to preach and to urge the French nobility to stand against the English. Overall, Constance's visions cover her personal experience of Christ and intimate identification with Christ’s pain. Constance uses her visions to accomplish her rather well defined and urgent political missions. After the initial vision, Constance's visions were mostly of an auditory nature. Instead of interpreting complicated visions, the Voices provided a ready-made script and allowed the mystics to supersede the authority, which required support of respected confessors and orthodox church in order to speak the voice of God outside of convent. In one of her vision, Christ appears as a man dressed in satin to assure her that he is in her heart. After another vision, Constance wonders whether the visions and the Voices are truly from God as the Voice presents the Book of Revelations.\n\n[4] Constance de Rabastens: Constance became involved with politics during the Great Schism. Constance claimed she was called upon to proclaim that archbishop of Toulouse backed the wrong pope in the Great Schism and will go to hell. The Great Schism of the Western Church began as the French cardinals voted Pope Urban VI and retracted their vote in order to replace him with Antipope Clement VII. This created chaos as the church had created both the pope and the antipope. Compared to Marie Robine and Catherine of Siena, Constance's intervention in politics did not go well because she supported the \"wrong\" pope of her region as she supported the Pope Urban VI instead of Antipope Clement VII. Also her convictions were contradictory as she was loyal to the French king, who supported Clement VII, and she worshiped Gaston III, Count of Foix, who remained neutral in most conflicts. As Constance's voice became more public, Guillaume de Luc, a master of the archbishop's entourage, have forbidden Raimond de Sabanac in writing down Constance's visions. Although Constance was consulted by highly placed people, she was still accused of being crazy and she did not have the kind of support Catherine of Siena had. Although Christ chosen her to explain the Holy Scriptures, according to her visions, it was not enough to confirm the divine origin of her visions to the inquisitor of Toulouse as they took it as a challenge to the authority. In 1385, Constance was taken in chains to the inquisitor of Toulouse, forbidden to publish her visions, and imprisoned. Constance was imprisoned for publicizing a series of apocalyptic revelations, and in one of the letter Constance notes that she was accused of \"having a demon in her body,\" though predictably she claimed direct inspiration from God. Couple instances of official queries displayed Constance's\n\n[5] Constance de Rabastens: One aspect of Constance's life is the relationship with her confessor, Raimond de Sabanac. Raimond was who put together all of the Constance's visions as he transcribed the visions for her. At one point in their relationship, Raimond stopped transcribing for Constance. Constance articulated this problem in one of her letters to the inquisitor of Toulouse as she asked for a secretary that can transcribe her visions. As Constance's visions became more public and known to the authorities of the church, they were ordered to cease the visions and the transcriptions. Despite Raimond's best efforts, Constance refused to be the perfect visionary and her headstrong support of the \"wrong\" pope, Pope Urban VI, could not be considered orthodox. Searching for an answer, Raimond asked God for a sign whether he should write or not, such as taking away his eyesight. Raimond only resumed to write for Constance as he was struck by an illness that the Voice identified as a sign from God.\n\n[6] Constance de Rabastens: Constance defined her political mission as she was commanded by the Voice. The Voice commanded Constance to send a letter to the King's Council in Toulouse to stop the support for the pope at Avignon, Clement VII. Following the Voice's command, Constance used strong terms and colorful images in her denunciation that leaves no doubts about the nature of her political intervention In Constance’s visions, the French cardinals who elected Clement VII are compared to false prophets who knew well that the election of the pope of Avignon was done against God’s will. To counteract the false prophets, she stated that the red beast, the pope of Rome, will rise. The red beast was spoken by John in the book of revelations and the color red signifies the fire of justice. Constance also designated the cardinals as “anticardonals” who surround the “antipapal” of Avignon. Constance presented this pope in many unpleasant ways: She saw a temple full of smoke and darkness and the pope of Avignon was inside. Later, she also saw three ships which two signified the world and the church. She stated that a limping man entered one of the former and made the ship instantly sink to the bottom of the sea. This limping man represented the Pope of Avignon. She also saw an angel holding a bloody sword above the pope as if he were about to kill him.\n\n[7] Constance de Rabastens: There seems to have been of no information about Constance's education or background but according to the visions she had, she admitted to not knowing the Book of Revelation. Constance never indicated she did any particular reading and any literacy Constance admits seems to seems to have been of miraculous origin. Most of the thirteenth-century saintly women often claimed ignorance and often professed unlearnedness to emphasize that the source of the visions was divine and not human.\n\n[8] Constance de Rabastens: Around the same time period, similar to Constance's vision, Honoré Bonet's exegesis of the Apocalypse displayed smoke rising from the pit and covering up the sun of the church (representing the pope). Although Blumenfeld-Kosinski states, \"people in different time periods and areas created imagery and depicted emotions that were quite similar and that expressed their anguish and uncertainty in the face of multiple popes\" during 1384-1386, when Constance had her visions, Bonet spent time in Constance's region composing history of the Count of Foix, including Constance's savior figure, Gaston III, Count of Foix. No acquaintance between Constance and Bonet can be made but there is certain coincidences in the images portrayed by them.\n\n[9] Constance de Rabastens: The six letters to the inquisitor were written early on in her visionary career (1384), when Raimond stopped writing for her due to fear and restrictions. In these letters, Constance showed her desire for safety as there was urgency in her voice. Constance, aware of the riskiness of her proclamations, warned the inquisitor that the voice promised divine vengeance on Toulouse for any harm done to her. She insisted that this threat came from the voice and not from her. She wrote that she will abide by their counsel but insisted that she will not cease her visions. Since Raimond was not writing for her, Constance even asked the inquisitor for secretaries who would record and disseminate her visions. Constance even warned the inquisitor of his impending death and insisted that an accurate transcript of the trial be made but no transcript of the trial was ever found.\n\n[10] Constance de Rabastens: As she continued to write to the inquisitor, Constance stated that the more she resisted the visions and revelations, the more they continued and more than before. Constance spoke about the vision she had which consisted of three cardinals that was in great torment and pain and one of them being more tormented compared to the other two. She revealed that the cardinal who was tormented the most was Sir Pierre de la Barriere and that she told this to her confessor. Constance stated that the confessor told her to reject the vision because it was untrue since he knew no one of the first name Pierre and that de la Barriere is a good person. Contradicting her confessor, Constance had a vision which told her that, “you should know that what you have seen is true, no matter what your confessor says. Know that his first name is really Pierre and that he can be compared to a stone, that is, the stone that brought the worst destruction to the path, and the stone on which the good seed fell but could not flourish. He preached lies and false errors before the king. He is not content with his own damnation, but wants to pull others into damnation with him. He is called la Barriere because he established a barrier between me and himself.” She stated that she was told to notify the inquisitor of these things completely and at length. Constance continued to describe her visions in this letter of Pierre being punished and also that she is afraid their failure to publish her visions will result in Christian faith falling into disgrace. Constance told the inquisitor that she is prepared to die for God’s honor and the salvation of the people. As she closed out the letter, she cried out for the inquisitor’s trust in her visions and requested for an answer. There was an urgency in Constance's voice, to convince the\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

In 2010, the daily was the number one in the list of the world's biggest selling newspapers with a circulation of 10,021,000. As of mid-year 2011, it still had a combined morning-evening circulation of almost 13.5 million for its national edition. The paper is printed twice a day and in several different local editions.\n\n[2] Michał Kruszka: On June 27, 1908 the \"Kuryer Polski\" celebrated its 20th anniversary by printing the largest newspaper edition ever made in Milwaukee. It featured 66 pages and a greeting (in Polish and English) thanking their readership of 70,000 Polish people in Milwaukee and 4 million Polish people in America. In 1909, Kruszka expanded his newspaper empire by purchasing \"Dziennik Narodowy\" (National Daily News) in Chicago.\n\n[3] Folha de S.Paulo: Ever since 1986, \"Folha\" has had the biggest circulation among the largest Brazilian newspapers – according to data by IVC (Instituto Verificador de Circulação), in January 2010, circulation was 279,000 copies on weekdays and 329,000 on Sundays. In company with \"O Estado de S. Paulo\" and \"O Globo\", \"Folha\" is regarded as one of the most influential daily news vehicles in Brazil. Among daily newspapers, \"Folha\" has also the news website with the largest number of visitors.\n\n[4] Verdens Gang: For many years, \"VG\" was the largest newspaper in Norway by circulation, which reached a peak of 390,000 in 2002. As its readers moved from the traditional newspaper to internet newspapers, the circulation has collapsed to 94,000 in 2016. VG is now the second largest print newspaper in Norway. It was overtaken by \"Aftenposten\" in 2010. The online newspaper \"vg.no\" is, however, by far the most visited in Norway, with 2 million daily readers.\n\n[5] Brush-Moore Newspapers: Brush-Moore Newspapers, Inc. was a United States newspaper group based in Ohio which had its origins in 1923 and was sold to Thomson Newspapers in 1967 for $72 million, the largest ever newspaper transaction at that time.\n\n[6] Joseph Pulitzer: In 1887, he recruited the famous investigative journalist Nellie Bly. In 1895 the \"World\" introduced the immensely popular \"The Yellow Kid\" comic by Richard F. Outcault, one of the first strips to be featured in the newly launched Sunday color supplement shortly after. Under Pulitzer's leadership, circulation grew from 15,000 to 600,000, making it the largest newspaper in the country.\n\n[7] Stavanger: The city's largest daily newspaper, Stavanger Aftenblad came out with its first issue in 1893. Competitor Rogalands Avis was first published in 1899 under the name \"1ste Mai\" ('1 May'), and published daily. In 1987 an attempt was made to establish a new daily newspaper, The West Coast, but it was only released for two months and ended with a total loss of NOK 27 million.\n\n[8] Okaz: In 2002, \"Okaz\" was the largest newspaper in the country. In 2003, it had an estimated circulation of 147,000 copies. Its estimated circulation is reported to be 150,000 in 2009. Dubai Press Club in 2010 reported that \"Okaz\" is the most popular Arabic daily paper in the Kingdom with a circulation of 250,000 that was confirmed by the media research.\n\n[9] Pedro J. Ramírez: The Office of Circulation Verification (OJD) confirmed that during its first year \"El Mundo\" obtained a circulation of more than 100,000 copies, while in 2007 it surpassed the mark of 335,000. According to the General Study on Media (EGM), \"El Mundo\" has more than 1,300,000 readers.

The 56 delegates to the Second Continental Congress represented the 13 former colonies which had declared themselves the \"United States of America,\" and they endorsed the Declaration of Independence which the Congress had approved on July 4, 1776. The Declaration proclaimed that the former Thirteen Colonies then at war with Great Britain were now a sovereign, independent nation and thus no longer a part of the British Empire. The signers’ names are grouped by state, with the exception of President of the Continental Congress John Hancock; the states are arranged geographically from north to south.\n\n[2] United States Declaration of Independence: The Declaration was transposed on paper, adopted by the Continental Congress, and signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, on July 4, 1776, according to the 1911 record of events by the U.S. State Department under Secretary Philander C. Knox. On August 2, 1776, a parchment paper copy of the Declaration was signed by 56 persons. Many of these signers were not present when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4. Signer Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire was seated in the Continental Congress in November; he asked for and received the privilege of adding his signature at that time, and signed on November 4, 1776.\n\n[3] United States Declaration of Independence: Historians have generally accepted McKean's version of events, arguing that the famous signed version of the Declaration was created after July 19, and was not signed by Congress until August 2, 1776. In 1986, legal historian Wilfred Ritz argued that historians had misunderstood the primary documents and given too much credence to McKean, who had not been present in Congress on July 4. According to Ritz, about thirty-four delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and the others signed on or after August 2. Historians who reject a July 4 signing maintain that most delegates signed on August 2, and that those eventual signers who were not present added their names later.\n\n[4] Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence: The Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, with 12 of the 13 colonies voting in favor and New York abstaining. The date that the Declaration was signed has long been the subject of debate. Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams all wrote that it was signed by Congress on the day when it was adopted on July 4, 1776. That assertion is seemingly confirmed by the signed copy of the Declaration, which is dated July 4. Additional support for the July 4 date is provided by the \"Journals of Congress\", the official public record of the Continental Congress. The proceedings for 1776 were first published in 1777, and the entry for July 4 states that the Declaration was engrossed and signed on that date (the official copy was handwritten).\n\n[5] United States Declaration of Independence: The Declaration became official when Congress voted for it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has long been the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.\n\n[6] United States Declaration of Independence: John Trumbull's painting \"Declaration of Independence\" has played a significant role in popular conceptions of the Declaration of Independence. The painting is in size and was commissioned by the United States Congress in 1817; it has hung in the United States Capitol Rotunda since 1826. It is sometimes described as the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but it actually shows the Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration to the Second Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, and not the signing of the document, which took place later.\n\n[7] Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence: The entry for August 2 states: In 1884, historian Mellen Chamberlain argued that these entries indicated that the famous signed version of the Declaration had been created following the July 19 resolution, and had not been signed by Congress until August 2. Subsequent research has confirmed that many of the signers had not been present in Congress on July 4, and that some delegates may have added their signatures even after August 2. Neither Jefferson nor Adams ever wavered from their belief that the signing ceremony took place on July 4, yet most historians have accepted the argument which David McCullough articulates in his biography of John Adams: \"No such scene, with all the delegates present, ever occurred at Philadelphia.\" Legal historian Wilfred Ritz concluded in 1986 that about 34 delegates signed the Declaration on July 4, and that the others signed on or after August 2. Ritz argues that the engrossed copy of the Declaration was signed by Congress on July 4, as Jefferson, Adams, and Franklin had stated, and that it was implausible that all three men had been mistaken. He believes that McKean's testimony was questionable, and that historians had misinterpreted the July 19 resolution. According to Ritz, this resolution did not call for a new document to be created, but rather for the existing one to be given a new title, which was necessary after New York had joined the other 12 states in declaring independence. He reasons that the phrase \"signed by every member of Congress\" in the July 19 resolution meant that delegates who had not signed the Declaration on the 4th were now required to do so.\n\n[8] United States Declaration of Independence: The United States Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1776. The Declaration announced that the Thirteen Colonies at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain would regard themselves as thirteen independent sovereign states, no longer under British rule. With the Declaration, these new states took a collective first step toward forming the United States of America. The declaration was signed by representatives from New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.\n\n[9] United States Declaration of Independence: A less partisan appreciation for the Declaration emerged in the years following the War of 1812, thanks to a growing American nationalism and a renewed interest in the history of the Revolution. In 1817, Congress commissioned John Trumbull's famous painting of the signers, which was exhibited to large crowds before being installed in the Capitol. The earliest commemorative printings of the Declaration also appeared at this time, offering many Americans their first view of the signed document. Collective biographies of the signers were first published in the 1820s, giving birth to what Garry Wills called the \"cult of the signers\". In the years that followed, many stories about the writing and signing of the document were published for the first time.\n\n[10] Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence: The first published version of the Declaration was the Dunlap broadside. The only names on that version were Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, and those names were printed rather than signatures. The public did not learn who had signed the engrossed copy until January 18, 1777, when the Congress ordered that an \"authenticated copy\" be sent to each of the 13 states, including the names of the signers. This copy is called the Goddard Broadside; it was the first to list all the signers except for Thomas McKean, who may not have signed the Declaration until after the Goddard Broadside was published. Congress Secretary Charles Thomson did not sign the engrossed copy of the Declaration, and his name doesn't appear on the Goddard Broadside, even though it does appear on the Dunlap broadside.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Because it is commanded by the Torah and not voluntary, the practice is not technically an act of charity; such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition. Jews give tzedakah, which can take the form of money, time and resources to the needy, out of \"righteousness\" and \"justice\" rather than benevolence, generosity, or charitableness. The Torah requires that 10 percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes, regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor.\n\n[2] Mitzvah: In its secondary meaning, Hebrew \"mitzvah\", as with English \"commandment\", refers to a moral deed performed within a religious duty. As such, the term \"mitzvah\" has also come to express an individual act of human kindness in keeping with the law. The expression includes a sense of heartfelt sentiment beyond mere legal duty, as \"you shall love your neighbor as yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18). The tertiary meaning of \"mitzvah\" also refers to the fulfillment of a \"mitzvah\".\n\n[3] Alms: In Judaism, \"tzedakah\" - a Hebrew term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify \"charity\" - refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just. Contemporary tzedakah is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical Maaser Ani, or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices including permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field, harvest during the Shmita (Sabbatical year), and other practices. Tzedakah, along with prayer and repentance, is regarded as ameliorating the consequences of bad acts.\n\n[4] Jewish views of poverty, wealth and charity: Tzedakah ( or Ṣ'daqah in Classical Hebrew (; ), is a Hebrew word literally meaning \"justice\" or \"righteousness\" but commonly used to signify \"charity\", though it is a different concept than charity because tzedakah is an obligation and charity is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity. It is based on the Hebrew word (צדק, \"tzedek\") meaning \"righteousness\", \"fairness\" or \"justice\", and it is related to the Hebrew word Tzadik meaning \"righteous\" as an adjective (or \"righteous individual\" as a noun in the form of a substantive). In Judaism, \"tzedakah\" refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasises are important parts of living a spiritual life. Maimonides says that, while the second highest form of \"tzedakah\" is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients, the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient supporting himself, instead of living upon others. Unlike philanthropy or charity, which is completely voluntary, \"tzedakah\" is seen as a religious obligation, which must be performed regardless of financial standing, and must even be performed by poor people. \"Tzedakah\" is considered to be one of the three main acts that can annul a less than favorable heavenly decree.\n\n[5] Alms: Alms-giving is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity. Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the reciprocity principle. Other Hindu texts, such as \"Vyasa Samhita\", state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives. The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a dharmic act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context. Some medieval era authors state that \"dāna\" is best done with \"shraddha\" (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without \"anasuya\" (finding faults in the recipient). These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of \"unquestioning hospitality\", where the \"dāna\" ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.\n\n[6] Glory (religion): \"Glory\" is one of the most common praise words in scripture. In the Hebrew Bible, the concept of glory is expressed with several Hebrew words, including \"Hod\" (הוד) and \"kavod\". Later, these original Hebrew Bible concepts for glory were translated in the Christian Testament as the Greek word \"doxa\" (δόξα). The Hebrew word \"kavod\" (K-V-D) has meant \"importance\", \"weight\", \"deference\", or \"heaviness\", but primarily \"kavod\" means \"glory\", \"respect\", \"honor\", and \"majesty\". In translating the Hebrew Bible, the Greek word used is \"δόξα\", a word also appearing extensively in the New Testament which was originally written in Greek. \"Doxa\" means \"judgment, opinion\", and by extension, \"good reputation, honor\". St. Augustine later rendered it as \"clara notitia cum laude\", \"brilliant celebrity with praise\".\n\n[7] Guilt (emotion): Guilt in the Christian Bible is not merely an emotional state but is a legal state of deserving punishment. The Hebrew Bible does not have a unique word for guilt, but uses a single word to signify: \"sin, the guilt of it, the punishment due unto it, and a sacrifice for it.\" The Greek New Testament uses a word for guilt that means \"standing exposed to judgment for sin\" (e. g., Romans 3:19). In what Christians call the \"Old Testament\", Christians believe the Bible teaches that, through sacrifice, one's sins can be forgiven (Judaism categorically rejects this idea, holding that forgiveness of sin is exclusively through repentance, and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance ). The New Testament says that this forgiveness is given as written in 1 Corinthians 15:3–4: \"3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, for that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.\" Some believe that the Old and New Testaments have differing opinions on the expiation of guilt because the Old Testaments were subject to the Age of Law and the New Testaments replace the Age of Law with the now current Age of Grace. However, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament salvation was granted based on God's grace and forgiveness (Gen 6:8; 19:19; Exo 33:12–17; 34:6–7). Animal sacrifices were only a symbol of the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ (Heb 10:1–4; 9–12). The whole world is guilty before God for abandoning him and his ways (Rom 3:19). In Jesus Christ, God took upon himself the sins of the world and died on the\n\n[8] Devekut: Across all Hasidism the continual mystical joy and \"bittul\"-humility \"between man and God\", is ideally reflected likewise in self-sacrifice to help another person \"between man and man\". In Jewish law, self-sacrifice is called \"mesiras nefesh\", and involves the occasional situations when one forfeits life. In daily terminology in Hasidism, mesiras nefesh means instead devoted sacrifice for God or another person. It is indicative of this that the two Hasidic schools most focused on daily learning of Hasidic thought, Habad (Lubavitch) and Breslav, have also become the two schools involved in the Baal Teshuva movement. In Habad, the talented young men and women devote themselves to going on Shlichus (outreach), rather than the traditional and commendable devotion to Torah study and personal spiritual advancement. In Habad thought, such material and spiritual help for another person achieves its own manifold spiritual illumination and refinement of one's personality. Just as some traditional forms of Jewish thought gave emphasis to fear of punishment as a helpful contribution to beginning Jewish observance, before progressing to more mature levels, so too do some Jewish approaches advocate motivation from eternal reward in the Hereafter, or the more refined ideal of seeking spiritual and scholarly self-advancement through Torah study. Study of Torah is seen by Rabbinic Judaism as the pre-eminent spiritual activity, as it leads to all other mitzvot (Jewish observances). To seek personal spiritual advancement through learning is a commendable ideal of Rabbinic Judaism.\n\n[9] Vayikra (parsha): Milgrom taught that the guilt or reparation offering in might seem at first glance to be restricted to offenses against God's sanctum or name, but reflected wider theological implications. The Hebrew noun , \"asham\", \"reparation, reparation offering,\" is related to the Hebrew verb , \"asheim\", \"feel guilt,\" which predominates in this offering in 23, and 26, and in the purification offering, as well, in 22, and 27; and Milgrom inferred from this relationship that expiation by sacrifice depended on both the worshiper's remorse and the reparation that the worshiper brought to both God and people to rectify the wrong. Milgrom noted that if a person falsely denied under oath having defrauded another, subsequently felt guilt, and restored the embezzled property and paid a 20 percent fine, the person was then eligible to request of God that a reparation offering expiate the false oath, as reflected in Milgrom saw here Priestly lawmakers in action, bending the sacrificial rules to foster the growth of individual conscience, permitting sacrificial expiation for a deliberate crime against God (knowingly taking a false oath) provided that the person repented before being apprehended. Thus ordains that repentance converted an intentional sin into an unintentional one, making it eligible for sacrificial expiation.\n\n[10] Valediction: Formal letters in Hebrew often end with \"b'chavod (rav*)\" (Hebrew: בכבוד *רב, lit: with (great*) honor) or somewhat less formal \"bivracha\" (Hebrew: בברכה, lit: with blessing). The informal ones may use \"kol toov\" (Hebrew: כל טוב, lit: all the best). For an intimate, you might end a letter or email with \"mitga'ageah\" (m) or \"mitga'aga'at\" (f) -- missing you. Jews in the United States often use \"B'shalom\" or \"shalom\" (Hebrew: בשלום, lit: in peace) within Jewish circles, for example, from a Rabbi to his congregation. This is an American Jewish usage, rarely heard from native speakers of Hebrew. \"B'shalom\" is incorrect, as it is religiously tantamount to wishing death on someone. Indeed, the Talmud says: \"In bidding farewell to the living one should not say, 'Go with peace' [lech b'shalom], but 'Go to peace' [lech l'shalom], because [King] David said to [his son] Absalom, 'Go with peace', and he went and was hanged; whereas Jethro said to Moses, 'Go to peace', and he went and succeeded.\" [Talmud, Moed Katan 29a]\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He topped the Test batting rankings on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in first-class cricket, with 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham at Edgbaston in 1994, which is the only quintuple hundred in first-class cricket history. Lara also holds the record for the highest individual score in a Test innings after scoring 400 not out against England at Antigua in 2004. Lara also shares the test record of scoring the highest number of runs in a single over in a Test match, when he scored 28 runs off an over by Robin Peterson of South Africa in 2003 (matched in 2013 by Australia's George Bailey).\n\n[2] List of international cricket centuries by Brian Lara: Brian Lara is a former cricketer and captain of the West Indies cricket team. He was a skilled batsman, and was known for his ability to bat for long and high-scoring innings. From his debut in international cricket in 1990 to his retirement in 2007, Lara scored 11,953 runs in Tests and 10,405 in One Day Internationals (ODI), accumulating a total of 53 centuries. His accomplishments with the bat saw him chosen as the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1994, as well as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1995.\n\n[3] Brian Lara: Lara is the father of two girls one called Sydney (born 1996) whom he fathered with Trinidadian journalist and model Leasel Rovedas. Sydney was named as a tribute to one of Lara's favourite grounds, the Sydney Cricket Ground, where Lara scored his first Test century- the highly acclaimed 277 in the 1992–93 season. His second daughter Tyla was also with Leasel Rovedas she was born in 2010.\n\n[4] Brian Lara Cricket: Brian Lara Cricket is the first in a series of cricket games to be endorsed by Brian Lara. There have been more games in the series, Brian Lara Cricket '96, Brian Lara Cricket '99, Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 and Brian Lara International Cricket 2007. Brian Lara Cricket was released on the PC in 1994 for DOS and Sega Mega Drive and Amiga in 1995 by Codemasters. The game was also rereleased in 1999 under the Codemaster Classics brand for Windows. It was developed by Audiogenic. The Mega Drive version spent 10 weeks at number 1 in the UK games charts during the summer of 1995. . The game is a rebranded version of \"Graham Gooch World Class Cricket\".\n\n[5] Brian Lara: Brian was one of his eleven siblings. His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to Fatima College where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.\n\n[6] Brian Lara Cricket (series): In 1994 Audiogenic identified an opportunity to capitalise on the success of Brian Lara, who had broken two long-standing world records, and rebranded World Class Cricket game as Brian Lara Cricket, initially for the DOS but also later for the Amiga. A year later Audiogenic licensed Brian Lara Cricket for the Sega Mega Drive to Codemasters. It was successful and spent 10 weeks at No.1 in the UK video games chart during the summer of 1995. Brian Lara Cricket '96 was released the following year in 1996 also by Codemasters, and it too got to No.1 in the charts. In late 1996 Codemasters acquired the Audiogenic development and Brian Lara Cricket '99 for the PlayStation console was released in 1998.\n\n[7] Brian Lara Cricket '96: Brian Lara Cricket '96 (also known as Lara '96 and Shane Warne Cricket in Australia and New Zealand) is a follow up to Brian Lara Cricket and the second game in the Brian Lara-endorsed series of cricket video games. It was developed by Audiogenic for Codemasters and released in the summer of 1996 for the Sega Mega Drive, Amiga and PC systems.\n\n[8] Brian Lara International Cricket 2005: This game is the follow-up to \"Brian Lara Cricket '99\" (also known as \"Shane Warne Cricket '99\" in Australia and New Zealand). It contains the 2003 Cricket World Cup in Africa and the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. These two competitions are licensed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and contain official player names, faces, kits, badges and sponsors. All other modes are unofficial as the rights for these belong to EA Sports and therefore some players and kits are made up; for example Graham Thorpe becomes \"G Thrip\" and Shane Warne becomes \"S Worde\". The only correct names in these modes are Brian Lara himself, (shown as \"B Lara\"), and Australian Captain Ricky Ponting (similarly shown as R Ponting). The game is also first to include licensed bats such as the Kookaburra Diablo and the GM Purist. The game takes the perspective of the normal cricket TV coverage, other views and displays in the game also try to emulate TV coverage of cricket, for example Hawk-Eye, an electronic system used to track cricket balls as they are bowled is featured in the game.\n\n[9] Brian Lara Cricket (series): In 2005 Codemasters released Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 for the PlayStation 2 console, it was released on 21 July to coincide with the start of the 2005 Ashes series. The game received high ratings. Off the back of this success, Codemasters has developed Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 which was released in March, 2007, to coincide with the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Brian Lara Pressure Play followed in August for the PSP, reaching No.1 in its first week on release.\n\n[10] History of the West Indian cricket team: For most of the 1990s, the West Indian batting lineup was dominated by Brian Lara. Lara became a regular in the side after the retirement of Viv Richards in 1991. In 1993–94, he scored 375 against England in Antigua, breaking Sobers' world record for the highest individual score in Test cricket. He continued his fine form playing for Warwickshire in the 1994 English County Championship, posting seven first-class hundreds in eight innings (including the Test match 375). The last of these was 501 not out against Durham, which improved upon Hanif Mohammad's thirty-five-year-old record as the highest score in first-class cricket. The West Indian bowling attack was spearheaded by Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh, the latter setting a then world record of 519 wickets. However, these two had both retired by 2001, and their successors failed to maintain the high standards that Ambrose and Walsh had set. Despite the emergence of some good batsmen like Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brian Lara remained the crucial figure of the side.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The project proved successful, raising . In March 2014, Facebook purchased Oculus for $2 billion. In March 2017, after three years at the company, it was announced Oculus founder and creator Palmer Luckey was leaving Facebook.\n\n[2] Oculus VR: Following the demonstration of the Oculus Rift prototype at E3 in June 2012, on August 1, 2012, the company announced a Kickstarter campaign to further develop the product. Oculus announced that the \"dev kit\" version of the Oculus Rift would be given as a reward to backers who pledged $300 or more on Kickstarter, with an expected shipping date set of December 2012 (though they did not actually ship until March 2013).\n\n[3] Oculus Rift: Two months after being formed as a company, Palmer's Oculus VR launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign on August 1 of 2012 for their virtual reality headset, which was named the Rift. The main purpose of the kickstarter was to get an Oculus Rift prototype—now referred to as DK1 (Development Kit 1)—into the hands of developers to begin integration of the device into their games. DK1 was given as a reward to backers who pledged $300 or more on Kickstarter, and was later sold publicly for $300 on their website. These kits sold at a rate of 4–5 per minute for the first day, before slowing down throughout the week.\n\n[4] Oculus VR: In April 2012, Luckey announced the Rift, a virtual reality headset designed for video gaming, and launched a Kickstarter campaign in August to make virtual reality headsets available to developers. The campaign proved successful and raised $2.4 million, ten times the original goal of $250,000. Two pre-production models were released to developers; the Oculus VR DK1 (Development Kit 1) and Oculus VR DK2 (Development Kit 2). The consumer product was released on March 28, 2016 with an all-new design incorporating specialized VR displays, positional audio, and infrared tracking system.\n\n[5] Palmer Luckey: He showed an early prototype to Brendan Iribe, a former executive of Gaikai and Scaleform Corporation, who described it as \"dangling wires and circuit boards and duct tape and hot glue all over the place\" and invested \"a few hundred thousand\" U.S. dollars in the Rift's Kickstarter campaign. Iribe later joined as Oculus VR's CEO, and Michael Antonov (former CTO of Scaleform) joined as chief software architect. Luckey also demonstrated the unit to Valve, and received Kickstarter endorsements from Valve's managing director Gabe Newell and prominent veteran Michael Abrash, now Chief Scientist at Oculus VR. During the Kickstarter campaign, Luckey demonstrated the Rift to gamers and the press at many gaming conventions, including PAX, Gamescom, and QuakeCon 2012.\n\n[6] Virtual reality headset: In 2012, a crowdfunding campaign began for a VR headset known as Oculus Rift; the project was led by several prominent video game developers, including John Carmack who later became the company's CTO. In March 2014, the project's parent company Oculus VR was acquired by Facebook for US$2 billion. The final consumer-oriented release of Oculus Rift began shipping on 28 March 2016.\n\n[7] Palmer Luckey: Luckey developed a series of prototypes exploring features like 3D stereoscopy, wireless, and extreme 270-degree field-of-view, while also decreasing size and weight of his systems. He shared regular updates on his progress on MTBS3D, a forum frequented by a small number of virtual reality enthusiasts. His 6th-generation unit was named the \"Rift\", intended to be sold as a do-it-yourself kit on Kickstarter crowdfunding Web site to fellow enthusiasts. He first started Oculus VR in order to facilitate the official launch of the Kickstarter campaign. John Carmack of id Software, a notable game developer famous for his work on the Doom and Quake videogame series, requested a prototype headset and used it to demonstrate a modified version of id Software's \"\" on the device at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012. With the resulting attention of thousands of people suddenly drawn to the Rift, Luckey dropped out of university to focus on it full-time.\n\n[8] Oculus Rift: Oculus VR announced on May 6, 2015, that the consumer version of the Rift would ship in the first quarter of 2016 with pre-orders starting on January 6, 2016, at 8 am PST. On January 5, 2016, the day before pre-orders went live, in an update posted to the original Kickstarter page, it was announced that all Kickstarter backers who pledged for a Rift development kit would get a free KickStarter Edition Oculus Rift. On January 6, 2016, pre-orders started, at $599.99. At the same time the shipment date was announced for March 28, 2016. On January 16, 2016, shipping dates for new orders of the Rift were delayed until July 2016 due to the number of pre-orders on day 1.\n\n[9] Oculus Rift: The Rift has gone through various pre-production models since the Kickstarter campaign, around five of which were demonstrated to the public. Two of these models were shipped to backers, labelled as development kits; the DK1 in mid 2013 and DK2 in mid-2014, to give developers a chance to develop content in time for the Rift's release. However, both were also purchased by a large number of enthusiasts who wished to get an early preview of the technology.\n\n[10] Oculus VR: In January 2016 at CES 2016, Oculus announced it will start shipping the Oculus Rift headset to customers in 20 countries on March 28, and it will cost $599. In January 2016, as a gesture of appreciation, Oculus announced it will give the 6,855 people who participated in the 2012 Kickstarter project a special-edition Oculus Rift one day before the new product goes on sale to the public on March 28, 2016. Oculus Touch motion controllers officially launched on December 6, 2016 for $199. Touch motion controllers had 53 game options at launch. Oculus Rift Earphones also started delivery on December 6, 2016 for $49.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Systematic European colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in what to be known to Europeans as the \"New World\". He ran aground on the northern part of Hispaniola on 5 December 1492, which the Taino people had inhabited since the 9th century; the site became the first permanent European settlement in the Americas. Western European conquest, large-scale exploration and colonization soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and Cuba. In 1497, Italian explorer John Cabot, on behalf of England, landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America.\n\n[2] Spice trade: It was during this time that Italian, Spanish and Portuguese explorers first set foot on the New World. Christopher Columbus was the first to do so in 1492 while sailing westward across the Atlantic Ocean on an expedition to the indies. Instead of reaching Asia, Colombus discovered the Americas, landing on an island in what is now the Bahamas. Believing to have in fact reached India, the crew named the natives \"Indians\", a name which has continued in use to this day, to describe the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Just eight years later in 1500, the Portuguese navigator, Pedro Álvares Cabral while attempting to reproduce Vasco da Gama’s Atlantic route to the Cape and India was blown westwards to what is today Brazil. After taking possession of the new land, Cabral resumed his voyage across the Atlantic to the southern tip of Africa and India, finally arriving there in September 1500 – opening for the first time a route from the New World to Asia – and returning to Portugal by 1501.\n\n[3] Settler colonialism: Extensive European colonization began in 1492, when a Spanish expedition headed by Genoese Christopher Columbus sailed west to find a new trade route to the Far East but inadvertently landed in the Americas. European conquest, large-scale exploration, colonization and industrial development soon followed. Columbus's first two voyages (1492–93) reached the Bahamas and various Caribbean islands, including Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1497, sailing from Bristol on behalf of England, John Cabot landed on the North American coast, and a year later, Columbus's third voyage reached the South American coast. As the sponsor of Christopher Columbus's voyages, Spain was the first European power to settle and colonize the largest areas, from North America and the Caribbean to the southern tip of South America. Spanish cities were founded as early as 1496 with Santo Domingo in today's Dominican Republic.\n\n[4] Spanish conquest of the Muisca: While De Ojeda was underway to Colombia, his rival Christopher Columbus started his fourth voyage, with thirty ships from Cádiz on May 11, 1502. Columbus landed on the previously unknown island of Martinique on June 15 and he continued his journey northwestward to reach Santo Domingo on June 29. As he was denied port in the Caribbean capital, Columbus sailed in the direction of Jamaica and from there to Guanaja, one of the Bay Islands off the coast of later Honduras, arriving one month later. On August 14, 1502, he landed as first European on the mainland of Central America, at a settlement that would later be called Puerto Castilla. Over the course of the next two months, Columbus explored the Caribbean Mosquito Coast of later Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, reaching the bay of Almirante on October 16. In this region, currently known as Bocas del Toro, he made first contact with the Chibcha-speaking Ngäbe people, learning about the resources of gold. After getting in conflict with the \"cacique\" of the area, El Quibían, Columbus and his men had to flee the region and set sail back to Hispaniola on April 16, 1503. After sighting the Cayman Islands on May 10, he arrived in Jamaica on June 25.\n\n[5] Columbus's letter on the first voyage: Christopher Columbus, a Genoese captain in the service of the Crown of Castile, set out on his first voyage in August 1492 with the objective of reaching the East Indies by sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. As is well known, instead of reaching Asia, Columbus stumbled upon the Caribbean islands of the Americas. Convinced nonetheless he had discovered the edges of Asia, Columbus set sail back to Spain on January 15, 1493, aboard the caravel \"Niña\". According to the journal of his voyage, on February 14, Columbus was caught in a storm off the Azores islands. The resulting poor condition of his ship forced him to put in at Lisbon (Portugal) on March 4, 1493. Columbus finally arrived at Palos de la Frontera in Spain eleven days later, on March 15, 1493.\n\n[6] Christopher Columbus: Christopher Columbus (; before 31 October 145120 May 1506) was an Italian explorer, navigator, and colonist who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean under the auspices of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain. He led the first European expeditions to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, initiating the permanent European colonization of the Americas. Columbus discovered the viable sailing route to the Americas, a continent which was not then known to the Old World. While what he thought he had discovered was a route to the Far East, he is credited with the opening of the Americas for conquest and settlement by Europeans.\n\n[7] Maritime history of Colonial America: The beginnings go back to at least as far as the first European contact with the Americas, when Leif Erikson established a short-lived settlement called Vinland in present-day Newfoundland. The existence of an actual shipping industry gradually came into being. Christopher Columbus was the first European to set foot on what would one day become U.S. territory when he came to Puerto Rico in 1493. In the 15th century, Europeans brought horses, cattle and hogs to the Americas.\n\n[8] Dominican Republic: Christopher Columbus arrived on the island in December 5, 1492, during the first of his four voyages to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it \"La Española\" due to its diverse climate and terrain which reminded him of the Spanish landscape. Traveling further east Columbus came across the Yaque del Norte River in the Cibao region, which he named Rio de Oro after discovering gold deposits nearby. On Columbus's return during his second voyage he established the settlement of La Isabela in what is now Puerto Plata on Jan. 1494, while he sent Alonso de Ojeda to search for gold in the region.\n\n[9] Voyages of Christopher Columbus: With the Age of Discovery starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the Americas. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the Treaty of Tordesillas purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands, thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World. The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the Islands of the Pacific Ocean. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500, when the Portuguese navigator Pedro Álvares Cabral arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\n[10] History of Jamaica: Christopher Columbus is believed to be the first European to reach Jamaica. He landed on the island on 5 May 1494, during his second voyage to the Americas. Columbus returned to Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the Americas. He had been sailing around the Caribbean nearly a year when a storm beached his ships in St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, on 25 June 1503. For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on the island, finally departing in June 1504.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Launched in January 1997, it is published in Chicago, Illinois, and has readers throughout the United States and around the world. From 1997 to 2006, it was published in collaboration between \"Cricket\" and \"Smithsonian\". Recommended for ages nine and above, it features articles about science, history, and the arts. Nine cartoon characters, known as the Muses, used to appear in the margins throughout the magazine as well as in the Kokopelli & Company comic strip. After merging with its sister magazine \"Odyssey\" in September 2015, \"Muse\" added new content, changed its layout, and replaced the Muses with a comic named \"Parallel U\" featuring different characters .\n\n[2] Muse (children's magazine): \"Muse\" is published nine times annually. Each issue contains a comic strip (\"Parallel U\") written by Caanan Grall, letters from readers (\"Muse\" Mail), a facts page (\"Muse\" News), a contest, a question-and-answer page written by Lizzie Wade, a page about technology, and articles on various topics. Past issues have included articles about vegetarianism, pie throwing, extraterrestrial life, naked mole-rats, the origin of the moon, pirates, urban legends, insects, mummies, tenrecs, the history of napkins, contacting ghosts, New Zealand's exploding trousers, Rube Goldberg inventions, \"The Lord of the Rings\", and blind cavefish.\n\n[3] The Muse (student paper): The Muse, successor to \"the Memorial Times\", began publishing in 1950 in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, as an unnamed paper. That paper held a contest to choose a new name, the winner being a professor who named the paper after all of the following:Beginning with a small editorial staff controlled by the student union, \"The Muse\" grew into an autonomous student-run paper. In the early years of publication, it was a campus gossip tabloid; in the late 1960s it developed an activist flair which attracted the attention of the provincial government and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), with the latter including \"The Muse\" in their investigations of supposedly Marxist organizations. In the late eighties, the paper was enlivened by the women's movement, and followed a more activist agenda, including special coverage of gay, lesbian and bisexual issues not discussed in the mainstream media, and a boycotted list of advertisers. \"The Muse\" incorporated in 2002 as The Muse Publications Inc, and became fully autonomous from the Memorial University students' union in January 2003.\n\n[4] Muse (Hong Kong magazine): Until December 2010, \"Muse\" published an award-winning monthly arts and culture magazine. It was the only art magazine to have won the Society of Publishers in Asia's Award for Editorial Excellence (local English newspaper/ magazine category) in 2008 and 2009. The magazine started publishing in February 2007 and released its last issue in December 2010.\n\n[5] Muse (Hong Kong magazine): In December 2011, \"Muse\" launched the first of a series of blogs on its web site. The bilingual blog section, labelled 'think again' (逆想), was launched with a theatre column by Winnie Chau (周潁榆), a Hong Kong theatre critic. This ongoing blog was paired with the past theatre archives from the magazine, encompassing more than 75 reviews and articles about Hong Kong theatre. In March 2012, a blog on architecture was added, authored by Sylvia Chan (陳曼霞).\n\n[6] The Muse (website): The Muse originally launched in Brooklyn as \"The Daily Muse\" on September 6, 2011, with eight editors and eleven columnists. The first version of the site grew from 20,000 users to 70,000 users in its first 3 months.\n\n[7] Muse (Hong Kong magazine): In 2010, \"Muse\" launched its inaugural 'The Next Big Things' election. The magazine solicited public nominations for what they considered to be 'next big things' in the local arts scene: the people, concepts, ideas, projects and events which were to make the greatest positive cultural impact. On 29 June 2010, an awards ceremony was held, bestowing awards to local screenwriter Christine To Chi-long (杜緻朗), HKAPA Dean of Drama, (鄧樹榮), and the Hong Kong Photo Festival 2010. The following year, the \"Muse\" 'Next Big Things' election was conducted entirely online, through Facebook. The winner, announced on 30 November 2011, was Hong Kong indie band my little airport, and three honourable mentions were named: theatre group FM Theatre Power (好戲量), actress Joman Chiang (蒋祖曼), and Leung Ping-kwan (也斯), an influential poet, novelist, and teacher.\n\n[8] Muse (Hong Kong magazine): \"Muse\" began publishing books under its imprint in April 2011, with \"Once A Hero: The Vanishing Hong Kong Cinema\" a book on Hong Kong film by Perry Lam. An expert in cinema and in cultural criticism, Lam had been editorial director of \"Muse magazine\" from 2007 to 2010 before becoming assistant editorial director of Oxford University Press. Another notable book from 2011 was \"Musings: Reading Hong Kong, China and the World\" a collection of essays by renowned Harvard and Chinese University of Hong Kong scholar Leo Lee Ou-fan. A review by Louis Lee in the South China Morning Post described \"Musings\" as: “engagingly written …offers not only a self-proclaimed Chinese cosmopolitan’s view on contemporary local and world literature, but also insights into the cultural and literary scene …of interest to readers worldwide who want to understand Hong Kong culture.” The book was also reviewed in major Chinese-language media including 亞洲週刊.\n\n[9] MODE (magazine): Publishing veterans Julie Lewit-Nirenberg and Nancy Nadler LeWinter, who had experience for magazines such as \"Vogue\", \"Esquire\", \"Harper's Bazaar\", \"Mademoiselle\" and \"Marie Claire\", began developing \"MODE\" in 1996. The first issue launched in February 1997 with a circulation of 250,000 copies. \"MODE\" received strong positive reception from readers(over 8,000 pieces of fan mail in just over a year) and from the press. After \"MODE\" launched, agencies increased their rosters of plus-size models and retailers improved the production value of their advertising. Freedom Publications bought a 50% stake in the magazine in late 1997. \"MODE\" started a partnership with Butterick Publishing Company to produce patterns, and began planning other ventures including a website, TV programming, and syndicated newspaper columns. The magazine also received acclaim, being named the best new magazine launch by Ad Week and Advertising Age in 1997. \"MODE\" began running model searches in conjunction with the Wilhelmina modeling agency in 1998, drawing entries from thousands of hopefuls from the US and Canada.\n\n[10] The Muse (website): The site was conceived after getting feedback from readers of \"The Daily Muse\", the company's career-focused online publication, that indicated readers found the job searching frustrating and \"would go through multiple rounds of interviews before realizing the company wasn't a great fit\". Furthermore, users said the #1 annoyance for them in the job search was never hearing back from an employer after they'd applied . Based on this realization, the 3 founders decided to create a different kind of job site. The site was launched under the name \"Company Muse\" in February 2012, and is now known simply as \"The Muse\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat was the main purpose of The Aristotle Association?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Folklore Museum of the Aristotle Association: The Aristotle Association was founded in Florina in 1941 for the main purpose of promoting the Greekness of the area. This was as a response to the German occupation of the town which promoted Bulgarian identity. In 1958, some of the members began to collect artefacts of local folk culture (from the Prespa villages and the Florina plain) in the old prison building. In 1987, the folklore collection, which was still growing, was transferred to the Aristotle Association's new premises in the city centre and is now a museum. The exhibits are displayed in thematic groups. For instance, there is clothing, with the traditional costumes of refugee women from Eastern Rumelia and Northern Epirus, from the villages of Kato Kleines and Flambouro respectively, and many local costumes for young and older people; weaving, with looms, distaffs, spindles, and so on; agricultural occupations, with tools for ploughing, winnowing, repairing, and so on; household utensils, with saucepans, long-handled coffee-pots, covered casserole dishes; and reception rooms.\n\n[2] Aristotle: Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his Laws of Association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.\n\n[3] Aristotle's views on women: Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate, to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves. This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman. And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple. For Aristotle, women's purpose is to give birth to children. Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in.\n\n[4] Christian contemplation: Aristotle, on the other hand, separated the spectating of \"theoria\" from practical purposes, and saw it as an end in itself, the highest activity of man. To indicate that it is the philosopher who devotes himself to pursuits most worthy of a free man, Heraclides of Pontus compared him to a spectator (\"theoros\") at the Olympic spectacle: unlike the other participants, he does not seek either glory, as does the competitor, or money, as does the businessman. Aristotle used the same image: Indeed, Andrea Wilson Nightingale says that Aristotle considers that those who, instead of pursuing \"theoria\" for its own sake, would put it to useful ends would be engaging in \"theoria\" in the wrong way, and Richard Kraut says that, for Aristotle, theoretical activity alone has limitless value. Thomas Louis Schubeck says that, in Aristotle's view, the knowledge that guides ethical political activity does not belong to \"theoria\". \"Leading a contemplative life can be considered Aristotle's answer to the question what life humans ought to live. … The more humans engage in contemplation, the closer they are to their gods and the more perfect will be their happiness.\"\n\n[5] Allied Artists Association: Its purpose was to provide a platform for the exhibition and promotion of modernist art in Britain. The AAA organised exhibitions at various venues, most notably an annual Salon, modelled partly on European Secessionist exhibitions, and particularly the Société des Artistes Indépendants in Paris. In an advertisement for the AAA in 1917, in the literary journal \"Art and Letters\", it was announced that the aim of the AAA was to organise exhibitions without the use of a selecting jury, with each member having 'the right to show any three works he (or she) pleases and to have one work hung on the line.'\n\n[6] Democritus: Most sources say that Democritus followed in the tradition of Leucippus and that they carried on the scientific rationalist philosophy associated with Miletus. Both were thoroughly materialist, believing everything to be the result of natural laws. Unlike Aristotle or Plato, the atomists attempted to explain the world without reasoning as to \"purpose\", \"prime mover\", or \"final cause\". For the atomists questions of physics should be answered with a mechanistic explanation (\"What earlier circumstances caused this event?\"), while their opponents search for explanations which, in addition to the material and mechanistic, also included the formal and teleological (\"What purpose did this event serve?\").\n\n[7] Aristotelian ethics: Aristotle claims that a human's highest functioning must include reasoning, being good at what sets humans apart from everything else. Or, as Aristotle explains it, \"The function of man is activity of soul in accordance with reason, or at least not without reason.\" He identifies two different ways in which the soul can engage: \"reasoning\" (both practical and theoretical) and \"following reasoning\". A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.\n\n[8] Metaphysics (Aristotle): Book Zeta begins with the remark that ‘Being’ has many senses. The purpose of philosophy is to understand being. The primary kind of being is what Aristotle calls \"substance\". What substances are there, and are there any substances besides perceptible ones? Aristotle considers four candidates for substance: (i) the ‘essence’ or ‘what it was to be a thing’ (ii) the Platonic universal, (iii) the genus to which a substance belongs and (iv) the substratum or ‘matter’ which underlies all the properties of a thing. He dismisses the idea that matter can be substance, for if we eliminate everything that is a property from what can have the property, we are left with something that has no properties at all. Such 'ultimate matter' cannot be substance. Separability and 'this-ness' are fundamental to our concept of substance.\n\n[9] Faculty of Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki: The Faculty of Engineering is one of the 12 Faculties of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It is divided in 8 Schools. Main purpose of the Faculty is to educate Engineers, ready to work. Also, another important purpose of Faculty is research. This research is taking place in each School, from almost every Professor and its target is to help the society, and promote the scientific knowledge.\n\n[10] Entertainment: Theatre performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to Hellenistic times when \"leading musicians and actors\" performed widely at \"poetical competitions\", for example at \"Delphi, Delos, Ephesus\". Aristotle and his teacher Plato both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as \"What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?\" The \"Ptolemys in Egypt, the Seleucids in Pergamum\" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged \"far more lavish productions\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

This was the \"Mayflower's\" intended destination until winter weather forced the ship to anchor at Cape Cod. A number of colonists travelled as paying passengers on the \"Mayflower\". Exactly what explanation was given for the More children's presence is not known as many \"homeless waifs from the streets of London were sent to the New World as laborers\".\n\n[2] Jacob Blakeway: At the time of the \"Mayflower\"'s sailing in September 1620, the children were aged between four and eight. The indentured servants were intended to be labour in the colony of (Northern) Virginia (present day Long Island). This was the Mayflower's intended destination until winter weather forced the ship to anchor at Cape Cod. A number of colonists travelled as paying passengers on the \"Mayflower\". Exactly what explanation was given for the More children's presence is not known. Many \"homeless waifs from the streets of London\" were to be sent to the New World as labourers. The children were amongst this group.They arrived at Provincetown Harbor in November 1620 and tragedy struck soon after the ships arrival with the death of Elinor More in November 1620; Jasper More died one month later in December 1620 of \"a common infection\", and Mary More died that first winter of 1620/1621.\n\n[3] Mayflower: Jones had originally planned to return to England as soon as the Pilgrims found a settlement site. But his crew members began to be ravaged by the same diseases that were felling the Pilgrims, and he realized that he had to remain in Plymouth Harbor \"till he saw his men began to recover.\" The \"Mayflower\" lay in New Plymouth harbor through the winter of 1620–21, then set sail for England on April 5, 1621, her empty hold ballasted with stones from the Plymouth Harbor shore. As with the Pilgrims, her sailors had been decimated by disease. Jones had lost his boatswain, his gunner, three quartermasters, the cook, and more than a dozen sailors.\n\n[4] Mayflower: In early September, western gales began to make the North Atlantic a dangerous place for sailing. The \"Mayflower's\" provisions were already quite low when departing Southampton, and they became lower still by delays of more than a month. The passengers had been on board the ship for this entire time, and they were worn out and in no condition for a very taxing, lengthy Atlantic journey cooped up in the cramped spaces of a small ship. But the \"Mayflower\" sailed from Plymouth on September 6, 1620 with what Bradford called \"a prosperous wind\".\n\n[5] Mayflower II: On April 20, 1957, \"Mayflower II\" began the solitary voyage across the Atlantic. For time and to avoid the risk of winter ice, the new ship took a more southerly route than the original \"Mayflower\" in September 1620, but otherwise the voyage was an accurate replication of a period ocean crossing. The weather cooperated; \"Mayflower II\" first sailed calm seas and then met a violent storm off Bermuda, common weather for a transatlantic crossing. She was commanded on her maiden voyage by Alan Villiers, and among the crew was Peter Padfield, who went on to become a naval historian.\n\n[6] English Americans: The second successful colony was Plymouth Colony, founded in 1620 by people who later became known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing religious persecution in the East Midlands in England, they first went to Holland, but feared losing their English identity. Because of this, they chose to relocate to the New World, with their voyage being financed by English investors. In September 1620, 102 passengers set sail aboard the \"Mayflower\", eventually settling at Plymouth Colony in November. Of the passengers on the Mayflower, 41 men signed the \"Mayflower Compact\" aboard ship on November 11, 1620, while anchored in Provincetown Harbor. Signers included Carver, Alden, Standish, Howland, Bradford, Allerton, and Fuller. This story has become a central theme in the United States cultural identity.\n\n[7] Mayflower II: Mayflower II is a replica of the 17th-century ship \"Mayflower\", celebrated for transporting the Pilgrims to the New World. The replica was built in Devon, England during 1955–1956, in a collaboration between Englishman Warwick Charlton and Plimoth Plantation, an American museum. The work drew upon reconstructed ship blueprints held by the American museum, along with hand construction by English shipbuilders using traditional methods. \"Mayflower II\" was sailed from Plymouth, Devon on April 20, 1957, recreating the original voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, under the command of Alan Villiers. According to the ship's log, \"Mayflower II\" arrived at Plymouth on June 22; it was towed up the East River into New York City on Monday, July 1, 1957, where Villiers and crew received a ticker-tape parade.\n\n[8] William Vassall: At an October 1629 meeting of the Company, William Vassall, with others, was appointed to travel out to New England. Per page 256 of The Mayflower Quarterly of September 2010, William Vassall sailed on the \"Lyon\" to New England in 1630 and returned on the \"Lyon\" to England about one month later. There is some confusion in the article as it states that Vassall traveled in company with Governor John Winthrop, who was just assuming his post. Other sources state that Winthrop did not travel on the \"Lyon\" but was on the \"Arbella\", flagship of what became known as The Winthrop Fleet - eleven ships bringing over 700 persons. This was the beginning of what came to be known as the historic event called The Great Migration - thousands of English settlers coming to New England in the early-mid-1630s.\n\n[9] Billericay: The Mayflower set sail once the Pilgrim Fathers had all boarded and set to meet the Shadwell in the English Channel, the Shadwell sailing from the Netherlands. Unfortunately the Shadwell developed leaks that could not be fixed and so the Ships headed to Plymouth to repair the Shadwell. A few months later the Mayflower set sail with out the Shadwell which was not able to be fixed.\n\n[10] John Robinson (pastor): Only a minority of the Leiden congregation would sail to America. Along with the hiring of the \"Mayflower\" at London, the \"Speedwell\" was engaged to transport the would-be Pilgrims from the Port of Delfshaven in the Netherlands to London to join with the Mayflower for the journey to America. Of the minority group that emigrated, Robinson's brother-in-law, John Carver, was appointed governor and William Brewster, as ruling elder. Unfortunately, the \"Speedwell\" proved unseaworthy after arriving at England and all those capable of transferring and crowding onto the \"Mayflower\" did so. But, it is unknown how many of the Pilgrims decided not to sail on the \"Mayflower\" either returning to Leiden or remaining in England. Only thirty-five members of Robinson's congregation actually sailed on the \"Mayflower\" joined by sixty-six people from Southampton and London who had little religious motivation for joining the Pilgrims. Before Carver and his group left Leiden, a solemn service was held, at which Robinson chose Ezra 8:21 as his text:\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The concept is related to but differs from the concepts of heaven, the afterlife, and the Kingdom of God in that heaven is another place or state generally seen as above the world, the afterlife is generally an individual's life after death, and the Kingdom of God could be in the present (such as realized eschatology) or the future.\n\n[2] Future: Eschatology is a part of theology and philosophy concerned with the final events in the history of the world, or the ultimate destiny of humanity, commonly referred to as the end of the world. While in mysticism the phrase refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and reunion with the Divine, in many traditional religions it is taught as an actual future event prophesied in sacred texts or folklore. More broadly, eschatology may encompass related concepts such as the Messiah or Messianic Age, the end time, and the end of days.\n\n[3] Creationism: For Orthodox Jews who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the Torah and if there seems to be a problem, epistemological limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for \"world\" in the Hebrew language—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can they know that the world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, former philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins University. Also, relatively old Kabbalistic sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century Tanna Nehunya ben HaKanah. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the Sefer HaTemunah, including the medieval Jewish scholar Nahmanides, his close student Isaac ben Samuel of Acre, and David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a Neanderthal-like species with which Adam mated (he did this\n\n[4] Immanence: Jewish mysticism gives explanations of greater depth and spirituality to the interconnected aspects of God's immanence and transcendence. The main expression of mysticism, the Kabbalah, began to be taught in 12th Century Europe, and reached a new systemisation in 16th Century Israel. The Kabbalah gives the full, subtle, traditional system of Jewish metaphysics. In the Medieval Kabbalah, new doctrines described the 10 \"Sephirot\" (divine emanations) through which the Infinite, unknowable divine essence reveals, emanates, and continuously creates existence. The Kabbalists identified the final, feminine \"Sefirah\" with the earlier, traditional Jewish concept of the \"Shekhinah\" (immanent divine presence). This gave great spirituality to earlier ideas in Jewish thought, such as the theological explanations of suffering (theodicy). In this example, the Kabbalists described the \"Shekhinah\" accompanying the children of Israel in their exile, being exiled alongside them, and yearning for Her redemption. Such a concept derives from the Kabbalistic theology that the physical World, and also the Upper spiritual Worlds, are continuously recreated from nothing by the \"Shefa\" (flow) of divine will, which emanates through the \"Sefirot\". As a result, within all creations are divine sparks of vitality that sustain them. Medieval \"Kabbalah\" describes two forms of divine emanation, a \"light that fills all worlds\", representing this immanent divine creative power, and a \"light that surrounds all worlds\", representing transcendent expressions of Divinity.\n\n[5] Pardes (Jewish exegesis): In Kabbalah, based on exoteric Midrash, the Hebrew Patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, embody the sephirot of \"Chesed-Kindness\", \"Gevurah-Strength\" and \"Tiferet-Beauty\". Kindness and Judgement are polar forces and Beauty harmonises. The imbalances emerged in Ishmael and Esau, while the harmony fathered the 12 tribes of Israel. Ishmael and Esau are considered the spiritual roots of the Nations, deriving from the initial unrectified spiritual Realm of Tohu-Chaos, whose pristine Divine potential was too high to be contained in Existence, shattering its vessels which fell down into exile. The Israelites relate to the lower Realm of Tikun-Rectification. The Messianic Era for all people will embody both advantages of the high lights of Tohu in the rectified vessels of Tikun, when \"all Nations will ascend the mountain of God\". Edom, the progeny of Esau, corresponds to unrectified Gevurah-Strength, the waste of which vitalises the kelipot shells. Gevurah is the constricting force in Creation, allowing independent Existence, but also causing the initial vessels of Tohu to act independently and shatter. The Edomite Kings who reigned before any king in Israel, while also being historical people according to \"Peshat\", in Kabbalah both embody and symbolise the vessels of Tohu that shattered. The verses name eight kings, the breakages in the eight emotional sephirot from Daat to Malchut. Death is the lights-souls reascending and the vessel fragments falling, animated by remnant sparks of light. Of the eighth king, only Genesis says he died, as Malchut remained partially intact. The sparks of holiness\n\n[6] Demythologization: The German theologian Rudolf Bultmann argues in his 1941 \"New Testament and Mythology\" that it is no longer plausible to demand that Christians accept the \"mythical world picture\" of the New Testament.We cannot use electric lights and radios and, in the event of illness, avail ourselves of modern medical and clinical means and at the same time believe in the spirit and wonder world of the New Testament.To interpret New Testament mythology in cosmological terms, as a description of the universe, is not plausible. This interpretation must be superseded by an anthropological interpretation that \"discloses the truth of the kerygma as kerygma for those who do not think mythologically.\"Can the Christian proclamation today expect men and women to acknowledge the mythical world picture as true? To do so would be both pointless and impossible. It would be pointless because there is nothing specifically Christian about the mythical world picture, which is simply the world picture of a time now past which was not yet formed by scientific thinking. It would be impossible because no one can appropriate a world picture by sheer resolve, since it is already given with one’s historical situation.\n\n[7] Christ Gospel Churches International: The emphasis of Berniece Hicks' teachings is that the Bible is the infallible Word of God and that it calls on Christians to grow to spiritual maturity, both in their moral development and in their spiritual love relationship with Jesus Christ. The Old Testament and the New Testament are in perfect harmony to reveal the Lord Jesus Christ. For example, the Mosaic Tabernacle in the Old Testament was laid out in the form of a cross, and serves as a picture or roadmap of believers' spiritual experiences as taught in the New Testament to grow to maturity in Christ Jesus (Hebrews 9:8-11; Ephesians 2:19-22). A core principle found throughout the Bible is that God is the Head over all things, and that all things work together for good to those who love the Lord. The Bible reveals degrees of glory for believers, and only those who seek a deeper walk with Jesus Christ in this life will enter into the Bride of Christ to be in His Personal Presence in eternity in the New Jerusalem. Other believers will be kings and priests on the New Earth and in the New Heavens.\n\n[8] Gilgul: This paradoxical dialectic is explained more generally in Hasidic thought as part of the divine cosmic plan of Kabbalistic Lights and Vessels. In each subsequent generation, the external levels of creation and this world (\"vessels\") descend to a lower level. This enables the difference between purity and impurity to become revealed, clarified and redeemed. At the same time, \"In every generation a new, higher light descends from on High\" to transform this World. This inner revelation ascends progressively to prepare for, and give a foretaste of the Messianic Era. In the future era, the constant, inner elevation of existence, the mystical purpose of creation, will be revealed, as the messianic revelations of divinity are created through the present service of God from below. In kabbalistic terminology this dialectic is also related to the \"masculine waters\" of \"direct light\" from above, and the \"feminine waters\" of \"reflected light\" from below. This explains the mystical concept in Hasidic interpretation of Kabbalah that in the messianic era, the feminine in creation will become the ascendant, and similarly the body will give life to the soul, the opposite of the present reality.\n\n[9] Eschatology: History is often divided into \"ages\" (aeons), which are time periods each with certain commonalities. One age comes to an end and a new age or world to come, where different realities are present, begins. When such transitions from one age to another are the subject of eschatological discussion, the phrase, \"end of the world\", is replaced by \"end of the age\", \"end of an era\", or \"end of life as we know it\". Much apocalyptic fiction does not deal with the \"end of time\" but rather with the end of a certain period, the end of life as it is now, and the beginning of a new period. It is usually a crisis that brings an end to current reality and ushers in a new way of living, thinking, or being. This crisis may take the form of the intervention of a deity in history, a war, a change in the environment, or the reaching of a new level of consciousness.\n\n[10] Sefirot: Kabbalah, the central system in Jewish mysticism, uses subtle anthropomorphic analogies and metaphors to describe God in Judaism, both the God-world relationship, and the inner nature of the Divine. These include the metaphor of the soul-body relationship, the functions of human soul-powers, the configuration of human bodily form, and male-female influences in the Divine. Kabbalists repeatedly warn and stress the need to divorce their notions from any corporality, dualism, plurality, or spatial and temporal connotations. As \"the Torah speaks in the language of Man\", the empirical terms are necessarily imposed upon human experience in this world. Once the analogy is described, its limitations are then related to, stripping the kernel of its husk, to arrive at a truer conception. Nonetheless, Kabbalists carefully chose their terminology to denote subtle connotations and profound relationships in the Divine spiritual influences. More accurately, as they see the emanation of the Material world from the Spiritual realms, the analogous anthropomorphisms and material metaphors themselves derive through cause and effect from their precise root analogies on High.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The show became a familiar presence in syndicated reruns from the 1960s through the 1980s, both on its original network, CBS, and on numerous regional independent stations. In 1999, the TV Land cable channel aired a few selected episodes. The show was never officially released on home video. CBS also aired daytime reruns in the early 1960s, with Bern Bennett being the live announcer for these.\n\n[2] The Millionaire (TV series): The Millionaire is an American anthology series that aired on CBS from 1955 to 1960. It was originally sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive. The series, produced by Don Fedderson and Fred Henry, explored the ways that sudden and unexpected wealth changed life, for better or for worse, and became a five-season hit during the Golden Age of Television, finishing in the Nielsen ratings at #9 for the 1955–1956 season, #13 in 1956–1957, #17 in 1957–1958 and #30 in 1958–1959. It told the stories of people who were given one million dollars ($ in dollars) from a benefactor who insisted they never knew him, with one exception.\n\n[3] The Secret Millionaire: The Secret Millionaire is a reality television show which originated in the UK, in which millionaires go incognito into impoverished communities and agree to give away tens of thousands of pounds (or tens of thousands of dollars in the US and Australian versions). Members of the community are told the cameras are present to film a documentary. The UK version is produced by production company RDF Media. It first aired in 2006 on Channel 4, with further series in subsequent years.\n\n[4] Regis Philbin: Philbin was the original host of the U.S. version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", an ABC game show that had its roots in Britain. \"Millionaire\" was a big ratings success in its 1999 debut, when it was intended as an occasional special series. ABC aired \"Millionaire\" as a regular series with frequent episodes, but its viewership slowly declined. After \"Millionaire\" was canceled, it was retooled in 2002 as a syndicated series hosted by Meredith Vieira, which continues today. ABC brought back \"Millionaire\" in 2004 with Philbin, retitled \"Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire\", a related series that was aired on a more limited basis. Philbin had appeared in 11 episodes of a special edition of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", which started on August 9, 2009, 10th anniversary of the show. He also was a celebrity contestant in this version. \"Millionaire\", in its syndicated format, uses guest hosts for selected weeks during the season and Philbin hosted a week of episodes that aired in November 2009, coinciding with his 2009 surgery.\n\n[5] Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show): In the New York media market, BVT sold the syndicated \"Millionaire\" to CBS's flagship station, WCBS-TV. In the season that had passed, WCBS' mid-afternoon schedule included the syndicated edition of NBC's \"Weakest Link\", which aired at 4 pm from its January 2002 premiere. Joining \"Millionaire\" as a new syndicated series was a spinoff of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw. WCBS picked up both series for 2002–03, with \"Dr. Phil\" serving as lead-in for the syndicated \"Millionaire\", which was plugged into the time slot that \"Weakest Link\" had been occupying.\n\n[6] Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show): Game Show Network (GSN) acquired the rerun rights to the U.S. \"Millionaire\" in August 2003. The network initially aired only episodes from the three seasons of the original prime-time run; however, additional episodes were later added. These included the \"Super Millionaire\" spin-off, which aired on GSN from May 2005 to January 2007, and the first two seasons of the syndicated version, which began airing on November 10, 2008. On December 4, 2017, GSN acquired the rerun rights to the Harrison episodes of \"Millionaire\" (seasons fourteen and fifteen), which began airing December 18, 2017.\n\n[7] Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show): In 2001, \"Millionaire\" producers began work on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network \"Millionaire\" ended that idea; however, the syndicated \"Millionaire\" still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, due in part to worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates.\n\n[8] List of Secret Millionaire (U.S. TV series) episodes: This is a list of episodes for \"Secret Millionaire\". \"Secret Millionaire\" is a television series that aired on Fox for its first season and then on ABC for its remaining seasons. The show's first season ran from on December 3 to December 18, 2008 and the second season ran from March 3 to April 10, 2011. The third season ran from June 3, 2012 to September 8, 2013.\n\n[9] Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show): In June 2003, a shakeup at one of BVT's corporate siblings provided the series with an opening. ABC announced that it would be returning the 12:30 pm network time slot to its affiliates in October of that year following the cancellation of the soap opera \"Port Charles\". ABC's flagship, WABC-TV, was thus in need of a program to fill the slot and BVT went to them asking if the station would pick up \"Millionaire\". WABC agreed to do this and when the new season launched that fall, the station began airing \"Millionaire\" at 12:30 pm. \"Millionaire\" continued to air on WABC in the afternoon for over a decade, eventually moving to the 2:00 p.m. hour to accommodate an expansion of the station's midday \"Eyewitness News\" broadcast in 2014. \"Millionaire\" briefly was reduced to an overnight slot when WABC picked up the talk show \"FABLife\" for its afternoon lineup; as a contingency Disney sold the series to WLNY for its daytime lineup. The arrangement did not last beyond the 2015-16 season as \"FABlife\" was cancelled at midseason, leading WABC to bring \"Millionaire\" back to daytime and WLNY to drop the show.\n\n[10] The Secret Millionaire: The first season of the Australian series (listed in local TV guides as \"The Secret Millionaire Australia\", to prevent confusion with the US version which had been broadcast earlier that year) aired in 2009 on the Nine Network. It consisted of five episodes, and was narrated by Russell Crowe; in a Herald Sun interview, Crowe discussed his work on the show and his personal approach to charity. Millionaires featured in the series included the now fugitive Albert Bertini (of failed property development firm Trivest), Derek Leddie (founder of market research firm The Leading Edge), Peter Bond (managing director of Linc Energy), Naomi Simson (founder of RedBalloon), and Danny Wallis (founder of DWS Advanced Business Solutions). A completed sixth episode was withdrawn from the broadcast schedule due to financial issues faced by the featured benefactor. More than $750,000 was given away in grants to individuals and community groups.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHow pond is formed?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Garden pond: Ponds may be created by natural processes or by people; however, the origin of the hole in the ground makes little difference to the kind of wildlife that will be found in the pond. Much more important is whether the pond is polluted or clean, how close it is to other wetlands and its depth, particularly whether it dries out from time to time and how many fish (if any) there are.\n\n[2] Pond: Ponds can result from a wide range of natural processes. Any depression in the ground which collects and retains a sufficient amount of precipitation can be considered a pond, and such depressions can be formed by a variety of geological and ecological events. Rivers often leave behind ponds in natural floodplains after spring flooding, and these can be very important to breeding fish, particularly in large river systems like the Amazon. Retreating glaciers can leave behind landscapes filled with small depressions, each developing its own pond; an example is the Prairie Pothole Region of North America. Many areas of landscape contain small depressions which form temporary ponds after spring snow melts, or during rainy seasons; these are called vernal ponds, and may be important sites for amphibian breeding. Some ponds are created by animals. Beaver ponds are the best-known example, but alligators also excavate ponds as well. In landscapes with organic soils, fires can also create depressions during periods of drought; these become open water when normal water levels return.\n\n[3] Dew pond: A method of constructing the base layer using chalk puddle was described in \"The Field\" 14 December 1907.  A Sussex farmer born in 1850 tells how he and his forefathers made dew ponds: If the pond's temperature is kept low, evaporation (a major water loss) may be significantly reduced, thus maintaining the collected rainwater. According to researcher Edward Martin, this may be attained by building the pond in a hollow, where cool air is likely to gather, or by keeping the surrounding grass long to enhance heat radiation. As the water level in the basin falls a well of cool, moist air tends to form over the surface, restricting evaporation.\n\n[4] Tropical salt pond ecosystem: Tropical salt ponds form as bays are gradually closed off with berms of rubble from the reef. Mangroves grow atop the berms, which gradually close off the area to create a salt pond. These typically form at the base of watersheds with steep slopes, as sediments transported during storm events begin to fill in and cover up the rubble berm. Mangroves may grow over the berm, also contributing to the isolation of the salt pond. Typically, the ponds communicate with the open sea through ground seepage.  Evaporation and precipitation cycles in salt ponds create variable environments with wide ranges of salinity and depth. Due to depth and temperature fluctuation salt pond could be classified as hyposaline 3-20 ppt, mesosaline 20-50 ppt, or hypersaline with ppt greater than 50. Another important aspect of salt ponds is their permanence. Salt ponds can eventually become filled in over time, and transition into an extension of the land. Some are intermittent ponds due to predictable dry and wet seasons while others are episodic (if the region has highly unpredictable weather).\n\n[5] Maschaug Pond: Its watershed covers ; is occupied by water. Maschaug itself has a surface area of , while nearby Little Maschaug Pond is . The pond averages deep, and has a salinity level of approximately 7 parts per thousand, too low to sustain the growth of eelgrass. The pond is non-tidal, except when breached by storms. The water directly receives about 57,219,222 gallons of precipitation per year, though groundwater flow is unknown. No rivers or streams flow into the pond. Maschaug Pond, like others in the region, was \"formed after the recession of the glaciers 12,000 years ago\".\n\n[6] Pond: In origin, a pond is a variant form of the word pound, meaning a confining enclosure. As straying cattle are enclosed in a pound so water is enclosed in a pond. In earlier times, ponds were artificial and utilitarian; as stew ponds, mill ponds and so on. The significance of this feature seems, in some cases, to have been lost when the word was carried abroad with emigrants. In the United States, natural pools are often called ponds. Ponds for a specific purpose keep the adjective, such as \"stock pond\", used for watering livestock.\n\n[7] Dapo Pond: Dapo Pond is an inland freshwater swamp. It was formed as a result of fault activity in Chishang. Its water comes from an underground stream located at the tip of the alluvial fan of Xinwulyu River. The pond river flows northward towards the lowlands, which then becomes the source of Xiuguluan River. Under the planning and revitalization efforts from Taitung County Government, the pond now has a surface area of around 20 hectares with another 20 hectares on its surrounding embankments and wetlands.\n\n[8] Richmond Park: There are about 30 ponds in the park. Some – including Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond – have been created to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear carp for food) date from 1746. They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to Beverley Brook. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas of water in the park.\n\n[9] Houghton's Pond: Houghton's Pond is a spring-fed kettle hole pond in Milton, Massachusetts, south of Boston. Like many ponds and lakes in the United States, it was formed by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago. By the standard definition of lakes being bodies of water larger than , the pond is technically a lake.\n\n[10] Jordán Pond: The pond was created by creating earth dam across the \"Košínský brook\" (\"Košínský potok\", also known as \"Tismenice\") with purpose to provide drinking water for town inhabitants. Later, it was used for aquaculture and in modern era as a place of recreation. Levee of the pond is 18 metres high, the area is 50 ha, it contains around 3 millions of m of water, deepest point is 12.5 metres below surface.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is the most popular recreational style due to the swimmer's head being out of the water a large portion of the time, and that it can be swum comfortably at slow speeds. In most swimming classes, beginners learn either the breaststroke or the freestyle (front crawl) first. However, at the competitive level, swimming breaststroke at speed requires comparable endurance and strength to other strokes. Some people refer to breaststroke as the \"frog\" stroke, as the arms and legs move somewhat like a frog swimming in the water. The stroke itself is the slowest of any competitive strokes and is thought to be the oldest of all swimming strokes.\n\n[2] Swimming pool: The modern Olympic Games started in 1896 and included swimming races, after which the popularity of swimming pools began to spread. In the US, the Racquet Club of Philadelphia clubhouse (1907) boasts one of the world's first modern above-ground swimming pools. The first swimming pool to go to sea on an ocean liner was installed on the White Star Line's \"Adriatic\" in 1906. The oldest known public swimming pool in America, Underwood Pool, is located in Belmont, Massachusetts.\n\n[3] Swimming: There are four main strokes used in competition and recreation swimming: the front crawl, also known as freestyle, the breaststroke, the backstroke and the butterfly. Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke. In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions. The butterfly stroke developed in the 1930s, and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. Butterfly is considered the hardest stroke by many people, but it is the most effective for all-around toning and the building of muscles. It also burns the most calories.\n\n[4] History of swimming: Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from South American natives he observed swimming on a trip to Buenos Aires. On his return to England in 1868, he successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873 and won a local competition in 1875. Although the new stroke was really the reintroduction of a more intuitive method for swimming, one that had been in evidence in ancient cultures such as Ancient Assyria, his method revolutionized the state of competitive swimming – his stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today. In his stroke, the arms were brought forward, alternating, while the body rolled from side to side. The kick was a scissors kick such as that familiarly used in breaststroke, with one kick for two arm strokes, although it is believed that the Native Americans had indeed used a flutter kick. Front crawl variants used different ratios of scissor kicks to arm strokes, or alternated with a flutter (up-and-down) kick. The speed of the new stroke was demonstrated by F.V.C. Lane in 1901, swimming in 1:00.0, an improvement of about ten seconds compared to the breaststroke record. Due to its speed the Trudgen became very quickly popular around the world, despite all the ungentleman-like splashing. Captain Matthew Webb was the first man to swim the English Channel (between England and France), in 1875. He used breaststroke, swimming in 21 hours and 45 minutes. His feat was not replicated or surpassed for the next 36 years, until Bill Burgess made the crossing in 1911. Other European countries also established swimming federations; Germany in 1882, France in 1890 and Hungary in 1896. The first European amateur swimming competitions were in 1889 in Vienna. The world's first women's swimming championship was held in Scotland in 1892\n\n[5] History of swimming: The Trudgen stroke was improved by Australian-born Richmond Cavill. Cavill, whose father Frederick Cavill narrowly failed to swim the English Channel, is credited with developing the stroke after observing a young boy from the Solomon Islands. Cavill and his brothers spread the Australian crawl to England, New Zealand and America. Richmond used this stroke in 1902 at an International Championships in England to set a new world record by out swimming all Trudgen swimmers over the in 0:58.4\n\n[6] Swimming pool: Swimming pools became popular in Britain in the mid-19th century. As early as 1837, six indoor pools with diving boards existed in London, England. The Maidstone Swimming Club in Maidstone, Kent is believed to be the oldest surviving swimming club in Britain. It was formed in 1844, in response to concerns over drownings in the River Medway, especially since would-be rescuers would often drown because they themselves could not swim to safety. The club used to swim in the River Medway, and would hold races, diving competitions and water polo matches. \"The South East Gazette\" July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party: coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river. The coffee was kept hot over a fire; club members had to tread water and drink coffee at the same time. The last swimmers managed to overturn the raft, to the amusement of 150 spectators.\n\n[7] Swimming (sport): Swimming emerged as a competitive recreational activity in the 1830s in England. In 1828, the first indoor swimming pool, St George's Baths was opened to the public. By 1837, the National Swimming Society was holding regular swimming competitions in six artificial swimming pools, built around London. The recreational activity grew in popularity and by 1880, when the first national governing body, the Amateur Swimming Association was formed, there were already over 300 regional clubs in operation across the country. In 1844 two Native American participants at a swimming competition in London introduced the front crawl to a European audience. Sir John Arthur Trudgen picked up the hand-over stroke from some South American natives and successfully debuted the new stroke in 1873, winning a local competition in England. His stroke is still regarded as the most powerful to use today.\n\n[8] Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay: The U.S. women's swimming team (Natalie Coughlin, Carly Piper, Dana Vollmer, and Kaitlin Sandeno) broke the oldest world record in the book, when they clocked at 7:53.42, slashing 2.05 seconds off the old, mark set by the East Germans exactly 17 years ago. Leading off the race, Coughlin swam a fastest split and a personal best of 1:57.74, which became quicker than a gold-medal performance of 1:58.03 set by Romania's Camelia Potec in the individual 200 m freestyle.\n\n[9] Maria Lenk: She also participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics, in Berlin, where she reached the semifinals of the 200m breaststroke event. In this occasion, she also became the first woman in the world to swim the Butterfly stroke in an official competition. At the time, the Butterfly stroke was used as a form of swimming the Breaststroke, and not yet recognized as a separate swimming stroke. Lenk's account of the event was that at the time she subscribed to a German specialized magazine that ran a story on David Armbruster's and Jack Sieg's work in developing \"a new way of swimming the Breaststroke\". She became interested and started practicing the stroke by herself in her training sections. In 1936, she and Jack Sieg were the only two people that were prepared to use the technique in the Breaststroke events at the Summer Olympics.\n\n[10] Cook Strait: In modern times, the strait was swum by Barrie Devenport in 1962. Lynne Cox was the first woman to swim it, in 1975. The most prolific swimmer of the strait is Philip Rush, who has crossed eight times, including two double crossings. Aditya Raut was the youngest swimmer at 11 years. Caitlin O'Reilly was the youngest female swimmer and youngest New Zealander at 12 years. Pam Dickson was the oldest swimmer at 55 years. John Coutts was the first person to swim the strait in both directions. By 2010, 74 single crossings had been made by 65 individuals, and three double crossings had been made by two individuals (Philip Rush and Meda McKenzie). In March 2016, Marilyn Korzekwa became the first Canadian and oldest woman, at 58 years old, to swim the strait.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the meaning of Japanese word Shinbu?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Shinbu: Shinbu () is a Japanese word, meaning \"military might\" or, in the narrow sense, \"sublime martial moral power\". The most common orthography of the word consists of the characters \"shin\"/\"kami\" (神), meaning \"deity\" or \"something divine\", and \"bu\" (武), denoting military, chivalry or arms. The idea of \"shinbu\" embraces physical, spiritual and ethical issues and denotes the condition when all basic principles of martial art are applied simultaneously and in balance. The phrase \"shinbu ni shite fusetsu\" (\"to attain shinbu and kill not\") appears in a number of treatises from Tokugawa era, the best known of which is \"Neko no myōjutsu\". The word attached to kamikaze squadrons of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force, such as the 72nd Shinbu Squadron, is a different word written as 振武.\n\n[2] Japanese aesthetics: Shibui (渋い) (adjective), shibumi (渋み) (noun), or shibusa (渋さ) (noun) are Japanese words which refer to a particular aesthetic or beauty of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive beauty. Originating in the Muromachi period (1336–1392) as shibushi, the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe persimmon. Shibui maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'. Like other Japanese aesthetic terms, such as iki and wabi-sabi, shibui can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion. Shibusa includes the following essential qualities. (1) Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity. (2) This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years. (3) Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi. Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. (4) Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.\n\n[3] Sino-Japanese vocabulary: Finally, quite a few words appear to be Sino-Japanese but are varied in origin, written with — kanji assigned without regard for etymology. In many cases, the characters were chosen only to indicate pronunciation. For example, \"sewa\" ('care, concern') is written , using the \"on'yomi\" \"se\" + \"wa\" ('household/society' + 'talk'); although this word is not Sino-Japanese but a native Japanese word believed to derive from \"sewashii\", meaning 'busy' or 'troublesome'; the written form is simply an attempt to assign plausible-looking characters pronounced \"se\" and \"wa\". Other \"ateji\" of this type include \"mendō\" ('face' + 'fall down' = 'bother, trouble') and \"yabo\" ('fields' + 'livelihood' = 'uncouth'). (The first gloss after each character roughly translates the kanji; the second is the meaning of the word in Japanese.)\n\n[4] Shigenobu: Shigenobu is a Japanese name. It is usually a male given name but can be a surname the name of a place. As with most personal names, the meaning of the name is derived from which \"kanji\" (Chinese characters) are used, and there are several different \"kanji\" that are pronounced \"shige\" and a few which can be pronounced \"nobu\".The following are spellings of the name \"Shigenobu\" in the two phonetic syllabaries of written Japanese, and thus have no intrinsic meaning:\n\n[5] Shinto: The word \"Shinto\" (\"Way of the Gods\") was adopted, originally as \"Jindō\" or \"Shindō\", from the written Chinese \"Shendao\" (神道, ), combining two \"kanji\": , meaning \"spirit\" or \"kami\"; and , \"path\", meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word \"dào\"). The oldest recorded usage of the word \"Shindo\" is from the second half of the 6th century. \"Kami\" is rendered in English as \"spirits\", \"essences\", or \"gods\", and refers to the energy generating the phenomena. Since the Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, \"kami\" also refers to the singular divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms: rocks, trees, rivers, animals, places, and even people can be said to possess the nature of \"kami\". Kami and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.\n\n[6] Japanese language: Japanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun \"hon\" () may refer to a single book or several books; \"hito\" () can mean \"person\" or \"people\", and \"ki\" () can be \"tree\" or \"trees\". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a counter word) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, or sometimes by duplication (e.g. , \"hitobito\", usually written with an iteration mark as ). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus \"Tanaka-san\" usually means \"Mr./Ms. Tanaka\". Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as \"-tachi\", but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase \"and company\". A group described as \"Tanaka-san-tachi\" may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as \"hitobito\" \"people\" and \"wareware\" \"we/us\", while the word \"tomodachi\" \"friend\" is considered singular, although plural in form.\n\n[7] Shina (word): In China, the term \"Shina\" has become linked with the Japanese invasion and Japanese war crimes, and has been considered a derogatory and deeply offensive ethnic slur ever since. Although many assume that the term was created (or chosen) by the Japanese for exclusive use as a racist term, since the character (Japanese: ; Chinese: ) means \"branch\" which could be interpreted to suggest that the Chinese are subservient to the Japanese, the characters were originally chosen simply for their sound values, not their meanings.\n\n[8] Shina (word): The Sanskrit term for China eventually spread into China, where its usage was closely related to Buddhism. A Tang Dynasty (618–907) poem titled \"Ti Fan Shu\" (literally \"preface to a Sanskrit book\") by Emperor Xuanzong of Tang uses the Chinese term () to refer to China: 《題梵書》 鶴立蛇形勢未休， 五天文字鬼神愁。 支那弟子無言語， 穿耳胡僧笑點頭。 The Latin term for China was \"Sinae\", plural of \"Sina.\" When Arai Hakuseki, a Japanese scholar, interrogated the Italian missionary Giovanni Battista Sidotti in 1708, he noticed that \"Sinae\", the Latin plural word Sidotti used to refer to China, was similar to \"Shina\", the Japanese pronunciation of . Then he began to use this word for China regardless of dynasty. Since the Meiji Era, \"Shina\" had been widely used as the translation of the Western term \"China\". For instance, \"Sinology\" was translated into \"Shinagaku\" ().\n\n[9] Shikibu-shō: \"In general, authors writing in English translate Japanese offices either literally, like “Ministry of Rites” (\"sic.\") for \"Shikibushô \"(McCullough and McCullough), or semantically, like “Ministry of Personnel” for the same \"Shikibushô\" (Joan Piggott, \"The Emergence of Japanese Kingship\", Stanford University Press, 1997).\" Versucher's article quoted above notes that the translations of medieval Japanese offices appended in Helen Craig McCullough and her husband's translation of \"Eiga monogatari\" are \"followed by numerous English-language authors\", and the McCulloughs translate \"Shikibu-shō\" as \"Ministry of Ceremonial\".\n\n[10] Religion in Japan: The word \"Shinto\" (\"way of the gods\") was adopted, originally as \"Shindo\", from the written Chinese \"Shendao\" (神道, ), combining two \"kanji\": , meaning \"spirit\" or \"kami\"; and , meaning a philosophical path or study (from the Chinese word \"dào\"). The oldest recorded usage of the word \"Shindo\" is from the second half of the 6th century. \"Kami\" are defined in English as \"spirits\", \"essences\" or \"gods\", referring to the energy generating the phenomena. Since Japanese language does not distinguish between singular and plural, \"kami\" refers to the divinity, or sacred essence, that manifests in multiple forms: rocks, trees, rivers, animals, places, and even people can be said to possess the nature of \"kami\". Kami and people are not separate; they exist within the same world and share its interrelated complexity.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He is the 'great hunter', god of the hunt, and carries a bow made of two snakes which appears to mortals as a rainbow. He rules the heavens and when the sun sets, he gathers pieces of the stars and throws it at the sun so that it may rise the next day in its full splendor. He contacts people by means of the mythical elephant Gor (the thunderer) or through a chameleon. Khonvoum created black and white people from black and white clay, and the Pygmies from red clay. For them he also created the jungle with its lush vegetation and animal life.\n\n[2] Mbuti mythology: The most important god of the Bambuti pantheon is Khonvoum (also Khonuum, Kmvoum, Chorum), a god of the hunt who wields a bow made from two snakes that together appear to humans as a rainbow. After sunset every day, Khonvoum gathers fragments of the stars and throws them into the sun to revitalize it for the next day. He occasionally contacts mortals through Gor (a thunder god who is also an elephant) or a chameleon (similar to the divine messenger used by Orish-nla of Yoruba mythology). Khonvoum created mankind from clay. Black people were made from black clay, white people came from white clay, and the Pygmies themselves came from red clay. He also creates the animals that are needed by hunters.\n\n[3] Somalomo: Led by their patriarch, called NTEUH, the Bampel and Elephant clan of the Badwee ethnic group, part of the larger Koozime tribe (made of the Ndjémé, Zimé and Koozimé) belonging to the Maka-Ndjem Western Bantu lineage first of all settled 15 km to the north of their present location, on a place called Bifolone, then at Mpoulabizame and afterward at Mpele, under the now leadership of Ndjankoum, son of Nteuh. Among Ndjankoum’s sons was the elder, Mampomo aged 25 years then (around 1880). Having heard of white, ghost like people coming from overseas and settling in Lomié with the Nzimé parent group, he decided to meet them. Due to his courage and initiative, he was recognized as the paramount chief of the Southern Badwee group of the Koozimé. Moving many times from Bilofone, he was established at Mpe’ezi, along the river Dja, between the present day cities of Lomié and Bengbis, in the Eastern and Southern Regions.\n\n[4] Nyboma: Nyboma Mwan'dido or Nyboma, is a prominent Congo Music singer. He was born on 24 December 1952 in Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo). Nyboma learned to sing as a child in Nioki, 200km north east of the capital, in the church choir. He sang in the school chorus when his family moved to Kinshasa while he was still in primary school. He joined his first band, Baby National, as a professional singer in 1969 at the age of eighteen and later moved to Negro Succes until Bavan Marie-Marie, Franco's brother, died. He then signed with Editions Veve record label owned by Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta (a soukous recording artist and producer/financier, composer, saxophonist, and band leader in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). In 1975 he became the leader of Orchestre Kamale, under the Editions Veve record label; the group was established by Verckys using some members of Orchestre Lipua Lipua (another of the various bands under the Verckys's Vévé label). Orchestre Kamale split up in 1978 when Assosa and Mulembu left to create Fuka Fuka. The Orchestre Kamale vestige was renamed Les Kamale with Nyboma at the helm. In the 1970s, Les Kamale was a popular danceband with their hits \"Salanga\" and \"Afida na ngai.\" In 1979 Nyboma was drafted into African All-Stars in Togo, after the bands' founder Sam Mangwana had left. In 1981 Nyboma recorded one of his biggest hits “Double Double” with his new band which he named Les Kamale Dynamiques Du Zaire.\n\n[5] Ruben Um Nyobé: Known as the Enigmatic Sphinx of Africa by the Europeans, Um Nyobé was initiated into the CGT union that fought against the partition on Cameroon into the Anglophone and the Francophone region in 1947, along the same period of the Partition of India and the end of the Indian Raj. Due to this fort resistance is seen around the world and particularly in Asia, Um Nyobé and the member of the Union began spreading the words of independence and denounced the Catholic religion that justified and advocated for colonization and slavery. His efforts managed to unite diverse ethnic groups to join the resistance against the French. He was named\" Mpodol Ion\", which meant speaker of the nation or spokesman in the native language of the people of Bassa. His friends called him Mpodol, which meant \"prophet\", due to the belief that it was his biblical mandate to lead and speak as their prophet.  He presented multiple forays in the united nation both in 1952 and in 1954 speaking on behalf of the people of Cameroon and other colonized African countries. He expressed his view of independence as an appeal to the natives of the country and must be the same vision for the rest of the World. As leader of the UPC, he made many gestures of integrity where he refused to negotiate with the French. His adamant character made him fearful by most of the French diplomats. In the struggle for Independence and the violence that surrounded it, Um Nyobé and members of the UPC fled underground. They were hunted by the French and decapitated one by one. Um Nyobé was brutally killed in his home along with his mother in law. Until this day, he is remembered as the Forgotten Founding Father of Cameroon by the International community. As a portrayal of loyalty by his people to him, a statue was the forgotten Hero in Eseka.\n\n[6] Bandrefam: The Bandefram-Cameroon Chiefdom. Pronounced Ndiògfap in local language, this name means farmers of old vineyards. Although Bandrefam is the official name, the population of this chiefdom call themselves Kouo'shi, which means : emerging from the ground. The Kouo'shi are Bamiléké people (Semi-Bantu) who are descended from several generations of migrants from North Cameroon and whose origins could be traced back to Egypt during Pharaohs’ time. Bandrefam is located about 300 km from Douala the commercial capital of Cameroon, about 300 km of Yaounde the political capital and 25 km from Bafoussam, the regional capital. At the administrative level, it is part of the Bayangam commune, in the department of Koung-Khi in the West province of Cameroon. The kingdom was directed by His Majesty Jiejip Pouokap,until January 14th, 2018 when he passed after an extensive illness.He's survived by one of his multiple children, Georges Jiejip Tchomgang.\n\n[7] Anlu (Cameroon): E. M. L. Endeley, the premier of the Southern Cameroon House of Assembly, was scheduled to travel through the Kom region to prepare for elections in 1959. Just prior to his scheduled visit, on 4 July 1958, a meeting was held in the town of Njinikom for a regional council member, Chia K. Bartholomew or C.K. Barth, to explain the contour farming law. Women surrounded the meeting before it adjourned and started the \"anlu\" with the traditional shrill cry. Bartholomew escaped from the meeting being chased by the women to the local priest's house. After a couple of hours, he left and returned home where the women gathered again that night. The women dressed in rags, men's clothing, and traditional vines spent the night following the usual \"anlu\" practices of shaming Bartholomew and polluting his yard. The movement was led by two women, Fuam (called the Queen) and Muana (called the Divisional Officer), who became the central political actors in the Kom region. The titles, Queen and Divisional Officer, were developed as mockery of the British colonial administration. The women led from the town of Wombong and created a parallel administrative structure during the disruptions from July 1958 until early 1961.\n\n[8] Kojo Tovalou Houénou: Marc Tovalou Quénum (name later changed to Kojo Tovalou Houénou) was born 25 April 1887 in the city of Porto-Novo. Porto-Novo had become a French protectorate earlier in the decade and would become a key site of warfare between the French colonial empire and the Kingdom of Dahomey from 1890 until 1894. His father, Joseph Tovalou Quénum (d. 1925), was a successful businessman along the coast and his mother was a sister of the last independent king of Dahomey, Béhanzin. Joseph was an active supporter of the French empire and believed it would greatly assist the economy of the region. He provided key support for the French empire during the Franco-Dahomean wars, was awarded the French medal of honor for his service, and became one of three African advisers to the French colonial administration. In 1900, Joseph took two of his sons to Paris for the Exposition Universelle or World's Fair and while there decided to enroll Houénou and his half brother at a boarding school in Bordeaux.\n\n[9] Stono Rebellion: Jemmy, the leader of the revolt, was a literate slave described in an eyewitness account as \"Angolan\". Historian John K. Thornton has noted that, because of patterns of trade, he was more likely from the Kingdom of Kongo in west Central Africa, which had long had relations with Portuguese traders. His cohort of 20 slaves were also called \"Angolan\", and likely also Kongolese. The slaves were described as Catholic, and some spoke Portuguese, learned from the traders operating in the Kongo Empire at the time. The patterns of trade and the fact that the Kongo was a Catholic nation point to their origin there. The leaders of the Kingdom of Kongo had voluntarily converted to Catholicism in 1491, followed by their people; by the 18th century, the religion was a fundamental part of its citizens' identity. The nation had independent relations with Rome. The region had slavery prior to the introduction of Christianity to the royal court of Kongo, and it was regulated by the Kingdom. Slavery was still practiced as late as the 1870s.\n\n[10] Shom-C: Chrispin Muyende Musosha (born June 23, 1989), better known by his stage name Shom-C, is a Zambian multi-genre music producer, sound engineer, and entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of Zero dB Music and AmaBeats.com. He is best known for his productions for popular Zambian hip-hop group Zone Fam. He has produced for many other popular Zambian artistes, including MK II , Ozzy, P-Jay, CQ, The Holstar, 32 Karat, Redwingz, Sobre, Njoya-T and B-Flow. He is widely regarded as a key figure in the popularization of multi-genre fusions, a type of production. He borrows from popular Western genres of hip-hop, reggae, R&B, and EDM and fuses them with a distinct Zambian sound.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Nine universities and colleges offer degrees in basic and applied sciences. In 1987–97, science and engineering students accounted for 41% of college and university enrollments. Under the 2009 initiative by the Moroccan government, universities will be made financially independent from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector. A total of 17 agreements were signed to develop Moroccan universities, as part of the 2009-2012 emergency program which aims to reform the country's ailing education system and foster a culture of entrepreneurship in the academic community.\n\n[2] Science and technology in Morocco: The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research is supporting research in advanced technologies and the development of innovative cities in Fez, Rabat and Marrakesh. The \"Moroccan Innovation Strategy f\"ixed the target of producing 1,000 Moroccan patents and creating 200 innovative start-ups by 2014. In parallel, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and New Technologies (as it has since become) created a Moroccan Club of Innovation in 2011, in partnership with the Moroccan Office of Industrial and Commercial Property. The idea is to create a network of players in innovation, including researchers, entrepreneurs, students and academics, to help them develop innovative projects.\n\n[3] Morocco: The Moroccan government has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs. In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research. The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia. He announced that investment in science and technology would rise from US$620,000 in 2008 to US$8.5 million (69 million Moroccan dirhams) in 2009, in order to finance the refurbishment and construction of laboratories, training courses for researchers in financial management, a scholarship programme for postgraduate research and incentive measures for companies prepared to finance research, such as giving them access to scientific results that they could then use to develop new products.\n\n[4] Science and technology in Morocco: In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research.The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia.

The Moroccan government has been implementing reforms to encourage scientific research in the Kingdom. While research has yet to acquire the status of a national priority in Morocco, the country does have major assets that could transform its R&D sector into a key vehicle for development. The industry remains dominated by the public sector, with the universities employing 58% of researchers. Morocco’s own evaluation of its national research system – carried out in 2003 – revealed that the country has a good supply of well trained high quality human resources and that some laboratories are of very high quality. However, the greatest gap at that point of time lied in the link between research and innovation. The educational qualifications of Moroccan researchers have increased significantly since the early 1990s. The University of Al-Karaouine is considered the oldest continuously operating academic degree-granting university in the world, by the Guinness Book of Records.\n\n[6] Science and technology in Morocco: The Moroccan government’s Five- Year Plan for 2000-2004 articulated the priority areas for research. The declared objectives of this plan were to align scientific research with socio-economic development priorities. Sectors declared as priority areas were: agriculture, fisheries, drinking water, geology, mining, energy, environment, information and telecommunications technologies, and transport. This approach highlighted the need for effective institutional coordination, which enabled different parties to work together around common priority socioeconomic objectives. In 2002, 89% of the 542 researchers in a sample comprising INRA, INRH, IAV Hassan II, ENFI, and ENA were trained to the postgraduate level and 34% held doctorates.\n\n[7] Science and technology in Pakistan: The Scientific and Technological Research Division (S&TR) was established in 1964 for (i) coordination and implementation of national science and technology policy; (ii) promotion and coordination of research and utilization of the results of research; (iii) development, production and utilization of nuclear energy; and (iv) coordination of utilization of scientific and technological manpower. The Division was administratively responsible for National Science Council, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Space and Upper Atmospheric Research Committee. The Ministry of Science and Technology (MoS&T) has been functioning since 1972. It is the national focal point and enabling arm of Government of Pakistan for planning, coordinating and directing efforts; to initiate and launch scientific and technological programs and projects as per national agenda for sound and sustainable Science & Technology Research base for the socio-economic development. From the areas of industrial development to renewable energy and rural development, the Ministry suggests technological development for higher growth-rates and to improve standards of living. Its principal focus is on building Pakistan's technological competence and developing a larger pool of human resources to reverse brain drain, and for integrating the existing technological infrastructure for strengthening of technology institutions, effective governance of S&TR and enhancing the capacity of indigenous innovation systems.\n\n[8] Information technology in Morocco: The future of the Moroccan IT sector was laid out in M@roc 2006-12, an initiative by the Moroccan government. The plan aims to increase the combined value of the telecoms and IT sector from Dh24bn ($3.1bn) in 2004 to Dh60bn ($7.8bn) in 2012.  In 2009 Morocco announced it will create a commission for the protection of personal data. The move comes as the country is seeking to adapt the laws pertaining to the treatment of personal data, to those of the EU. This is expected to strengthen its offshoring and outsourcing market. In recent years the government also launched several science parks, and areas dedicated to BPO and IT.\n\n[9] Science and technology in Morocco: Moroccan articles were fairly evenly spread across all fields of natural and social sciences between 2008 and 2014, with medical sciences, physics and chemistry being the most prominent fields of research. Between 2008 and 2014, Morocco's main scientific partners were based in France (3,465 articles), Spain, (1,338), the United States (833), Italy (777) and Germany (752).\n\n[10] Science and technology in Morocco: In 2008, Morocco announced plans for a new campus to strengthen research and training in clean technology. The campus was to be part of a US$219 million clean energy industrial park being built in the city of Oujda to support private sector investment in renewable energy. Due to be completed in 2010, the 'knowledge campus' was part of a US$3.2 billion five-year renewable energy investment plan for 2009–2014 prepared by the Moroccan National Electricity Office.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Following the death of terminally ill Konstantin Chernenko, the Politburo elected Mikhail Gorbachev to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in March 1985. At 54, Gorbachev was the youngest person since Joseph Stalin to become General Secretary and the country's first head of state born a Soviet citizen instead of a subject of the tsar. During his official confirmation on March 11, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko spoke of how the new Soviet leader had filled in for Chernenko as CC Secretariat, and praised his intelligence and flexible, pragmatic ideas instead of rigid adherence to party ideology. Gorbachev was aided by a lack of serious competition in the Politburo. He immediately began appointing younger men of his generation to important party posts, including Nikolai Ryzhkov, Secretary of Economics, Viktor Cherbrikov, KGB Chief, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze (replacing the 75-year-old Gromyko), Secretary of Defense Industries Lev Zaikov, and Secretary of Construction Boris Yeltsin. Removed from the Politburo and Secretariat was Grigory Romanov, who had been Gorbachev's most significant rival for the position of General Secretary. Gromyko's removal as Foreign Minister was the most unexpected change given his decades of unflinching, faithful service compared to the unknown, inexperienced Shevardnadze.\n\n[2] Mikhail Gorbachev: Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev (born 2 March 1931) is a Russian and formerly Soviet politician. The eighth and last leader of the Soviet Union, he was General Secretary of the governing Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991. He was the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991, serving as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1988 to 1989, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet from 1989 to 1990, and President of the Soviet Union from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically a socialist, he initially adhered to Marxism-Leninism although following the Soviet collapse moved toward social democracy.\n\n[3] Communism in Russia: Konstantin Chernenko led the Soviet Union from 1984 until his death thirteen months later in 1985. Chernenko was unable to consolidate power and effective control of the Communist party. Chernenko did little to prevent the escalation of the cold war with the United States and Western Europe. Mikhail Gorbachev became the last leader of the Soviet Union in 1985 and led until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Gorbachev improved relations and trade with the West, and reduced the Cold War tensions. He implemented the Glasnost, which meant that Soviet people had the freedom that they never previously had; this included greater freedom of speech. The press was less controlled and many thousands of political prisoners and dissidents were released. Gorbachev removed the constitutional role of the Communist party. This led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on December 26, 1991.\n\n[4] 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: The 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was held from 25 February to 6 March 1986 in Moscow. This was the first congress presided over by Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In accordance with the pattern set 20 years earlier by Leonid Brezhnev, the congress occurred five years after the previous CPSU Congress. Much had changed in those five years. Key figures of Soviet politics, Mikhail Suslov, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Dmitriy Ustinov, and Konstantin Chernenko had died, and Mikhail Gorbachev had become General Secretary of the Party. For this reason the congress was widely anticipated, both at home and abroad, as an indicator of Gorbachev's new policies and directions. The congress was attended by 4993 delegates. It elected the 27th Central Committee.\n\n[5] List of leaders of the Soviet Union: At the age of 54, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985. In May 1985, Gorbachev publicly admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequate living standards, being the first Soviet leader to do so while also beginning a series of fundamental reforms. From 1986 to around 1988, he dismantled central planning, allowed state enterprises to set their own outputs, enabled private investment in businesses not previously permitted to be privately owned and allowed foreign investment, among other measures. He also opened up the management of and decision-making within the Soviet Union and allowed greater public discussion and criticism, along with a warming of relationships with the West. These twin policies were known as \"perestroika\" (literally meaning \"reconstruction\", but it varies) and \"glasnost\" (\"openness\" and \"transparency\"), respectively. The dismantling of the principal defining features of Soviet Communism in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of the Soviet Union breaking up after the failed August coup of 1991 led by Gennady Yanayev.\n\n[6] History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Mikhail Gorbachev became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interregnum after Brezhnev's death in 1982 when the party was led first by Yuri Andropov and then by Konstantin Chernenko. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was \"the\" leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise stopgap candidate as Gorbachev – Andropov's protege – lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko to become General Secretary when Chernenko died. There are indications Gorbachev may have been in control prior to Chernenko's death as he was announced as the new General Secretary the day after Chernenko died on March 10, 1985.\n\n[7] Eduard Shevardnadze: When Chernenko died, Shevardnadze became a strong supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev's leadership candidacy. Shevardnadze became a member of the Central Committee (CC) of the CPSU in 1976, and in 1978 was promoted to the rank of non-voting candidate member of the Soviet Political Bureau (Politburo). His chance came in 1985, when the veteran Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko left that post for the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The \"de facto\" leader, Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, appointed Shevardnadze to replace Gromyko as Minister of Foreign Affairs, thus consolidating Gorbachev's circle of relatively young reformers.\n\n[8] Collective leadership in the Soviet Union: As Brezhnev's health worsened during the late 1970s, the collective leadership became even more \"collective\". Brezhnev's death did not alter the balance of power in any radical fashion, and Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko were obliged by protocol to rule the country in the very same fashion as Brezhnev. When Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the position of General Secretary in March 1985, some observers wondered if he could be the leader to overcome the restraints of the collective leadership. Gorbachev's reform agenda had succeeded in altering the Soviet political system for good; however, this change made him some enemies. Many of Gorbachev's closest allies disagreed with him on what reforms were needed, or how radical they should be.\n\n[9] History of the Soviet Union (1982–91): Andropov's health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, and he became the first Soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that November. He died in February 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months. His most significant legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point, Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout Andropov's illness, Gorbachev's time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.\n\n[10] Mikhail Gorbachev: Further embarrassing facts about Soviet history were revealed in April, when the government admitted that the NKVD had carried out the infamous Katyn massacre of Polish army officers during World War II; previously, the USSR had blamed Nazi Germany. More significantly for Gorbachev's position, Boris Yeltsin reached a new level of prominence, as he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR in May, effectively making him the de jure leader of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Problems for Gorbachev once again came from the Russian parliament in June, when it declared the precedence of Russian laws over All-Union-level legislation. Meanwhile, Gorbachev's personal political position continued to change. At the 28th CPSU Congress in July, Gorbachev was re-elected general secretary, but this position was now completely independent of Soviet government, and the Politburo had no say in the ruling of the country. Gorbachev further reduced Party power in the same month, when he issued a decree abolishing Party control of all areas of the media and broadcasting.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It spans the Maquoketa River for . James S. Applegate established a gristmill near this location in 1858. He was joined by John Corbett, who obtained ownership by 1868 and expanded the operation and added a sawmill. He petitioned the Jones County Board of Supervisors for an iron bridge at this location in 1870. They agreed to pay two-thirds of the construction costs with the final third paid for by local subscriptions. The contract to construct this bridge and a similar span in Monticello was made with Miller, Jamison & Company of Cleveland. Both are single span bowstring truss bridges that were completed in November 1871. This bridge has always been identified with the mill. Samuel Eby acquired it in 1875, and it remained in the family until 1913. The bridge was originally on a loop road that circled behind the mill pond. When County Road X73 was created in 1958 it bypassed the bridge to the south. The bridge has been under private ownership ever since. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.\n\n[2] River Rea: Wychall Reservoir, near the river at Kings Norton, was built in the early 19th century by the Worcester Canal Company after mill owners claimed that water was being taken from the river to fill the canal and reducing the working effectiveness of their mills. Following Kings Norton, the river flows through Stirchley. It is now culverted for much of its course through Birmingham, during which it passes through the Pebble Mill area and Cannon Hill Park then Calthorpe Park. A pair of decorative arches on the bridge where Gooch Street crosses the river mark the first settlement of Birmingham. The medieval hamlet of Birmingham was built on a crossing on the Rea in what is now Digbeth. Many of the street names in the area refer to the river or its mills. These include Rea Street, Floodgate Street, River Street and Duddeston Mill Road. There are proposals to include a riverside walk and new bridge over the Rea at Digbeth's Custard Factory media and arts complex (now complete). There are also proposals for the river to be uncovered at the Warwick Bar area of Digbeth.\n\n[3] River Dearne: The river rises from just below the contour to the west of Birdsedge. Within around , it reaches the A635 Barnsley Road bridge at Denby Dale, by which time it has dropped below the contour, and its flow has been swelled by a number of springs and the output of the Park Dike. Below the bridge, the Munchcliffe Beck joins, and there is a large millpond, which supplied mills at Denby Dale. Beyond the mills, it crosses under a railway viaduct by Denby Dale railway station. The viaduct is curved, with 21 tall arches, and was built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1884. Next the river flows to the north east, with the A636 road closely following it on the north bank. It is joined by the Thorpe Dike at Kitchenroyd. It passes through Scissett and then to the west of Clayton West, where it is crossed by the Kirklees Light Railway. Park Gate Dike again swells the flow, before a double-arched skew bridge built in the early 19th century carries the A636 over the channel. Nearby is a hump-backed packhorse bridge with a single arch, probably built in the previous century, after which the river turns to the east to pass by the upper and lower lakes of Bretton Country Park on the south bank and Bretton Hall with the Yorkshire Sculpture Park on the north. There is a weir on the river and one on the outflow from the lakes, after which the contour is crossed.\n\n[4] River Loddon: Immediately below the bridge, the river widens, as it formed a reservoir for the Lower Mill, a corn mill in 1872, but disused by 1932. Leaving the environs of Basingstoke behind, the river flows north through open north Hampshire countryside. There are two channels, the Upper River to the north and the Lower River to the south. There are various interconnections and tributary streams, before the Lyde River joins it just above the village of Sherfield on Loddon. Hartley Mill was on the Lyde just above the confluence, but was disused by 1968. At Sherfield, Longbridge Mill is just above Long Bridge, which carries the A33 road over the river and a backwater. North of Sherfield the river passes the site of Lilly Mill and crosses under Broadford Bridge, before passing through the ornamental grounds of Stratfield Saye House, the home of the Dukes of Wellington since 1817. Within the park is a cast iron grade II* listed bridge designed by Thomas Wilson in 1802. Stanfordend Bridge is to the north of the park, and is grade II listed. It has two small arches separated by buttresses, and bears the date 1787. Stanfordend Flour Mill was just beyond it, but it was disused by 1961.\n\n[5] River Frome, Bristol: The river then flows under the M32 motorway and parallels its course for a while before disappearing into an underground culvert at Eastville Sluices, upstream of Baptist Mills. It is joined underground by Coombe brook on the left and Horfield brook on the right. A brief stretch in St Judes is uncovered and then the river runs underneath Broad Weir, Fairfax Street and Rupert Street. At the site of the former Stone Bridge, near the junction of Rupert Street and Christmas Street, the main flow is channelled through Mylnes Culvert. This follows the course of Marsh Street, Prince Street and Wapping Road, and joins the New Cut close to Gaol Ferry Bridge. The culverted section between Stone Bridge and St Augustine's Reach is now a flood relief channel.\n\n[6] Cornmill Stream: After leaving the River Lee Flood Relief Channel (Horsemill Stream) at Fishers Green the stream flows south to form the western boundary with the former Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills before flowing through the Waltham Abbey SSSI within the Gunpowder Mills property. Above Waltham Abbey the stream diverges from the Old River Lea with both channels bordering the Cornmill Stream and Old River Lea, SSSI. The stream passes under the 14th-century Harold's Bridge and the B194 road (Abbey View) before flowing through a sluice in the abbey's grounds. The stream flows underground to emerge adjacent to Waltham Abbey town hall. After flowing through an urban area, it rejoins the River Lee Flood Relief Channel beyond the town of Waltham Abbey.\n\n[7] River Cole, West Midlands: Crossing Slade Lane at a ford, the 'slade' is the Cole's black silted boggy valley, it begins a journey through the seven kilometres, between Yardley Wood and Small Heath of the Shire Country Park. Firstly passing through Scribers Lane SINC (Site of Nature Conservation Interest), a diverse site with mixed broadleaf woodland containing wet flushes and ditches, a disused millrace and a wetland scrape. Over the past few years there have been reports of otter, water vole and water rail in this area. It runs along the River to the Scribers Lane Ford. A leat also carries water to the mill race and former mill pond of Tritterford Mill. It is bridged at Highfield Road by what was formally Titterford wain bridge built in the early 19th century but now replaced by a new bridge by which Highfield Road sweeps across the river and up the hill to Christ Church. Due to the construction of the mill pool, Chinn Brook had to be diverted far into the Dingles, flowing at a lesser gradient than the river, until it could join the Cole at the same level. The river then flows through the Dingles where towards Brook Lane is Four Arches Bridge. First recorded in 1822, it formerly linked Webb and Old Brook Lanes. The wain ford alongside and the side approached have disappeared. When the North Warwickshire Line was being built between 1906/7, its embankment cut off both Webb Lane and Robin Hood Lane and to avoid the cost of two bridges so close together, a single span was placed centrally and the lanes diverted to it. Both fords then went out of use. For two decades the Four Arches Bridge continued to be used, but then Cole Valley Road was built up and thenceforward the bridge led nowhere, and it was allowed to fall into\n\n[8] Course of the Willamette River: Below Peoria, the river subdivides at about from the mouth to form a complex set of linked sloughs and channels that flow around islands—McBee, Baker, Bear, John Smith, Centennial, Horseshoe, Kiger, Stahlbusch, and Fischer—before re-joining about downstream near Corvallis. In this stretch, the east channel of the river receives Muddy Creek from the right, and the main channel flows by Willamette Park and the Crystal Lake Sports Fields and Kendall Natural Area, all in Corvallis, on the river's left. Marys River enters from the left at about RM 132 (RK 212), at the Pioneer Boat Basin City Park. In Corvallis, the river passes under the Corvallis Bypass Bridge, which carries Oregon Route 34 Bypass, then flows by Kermit E. Ross City Park on the left and Alan B. Berg City Park on the right. It passes under the Van Buren Street Bridge, which carries eastbound Oregon Route 34 traffic, and then under the Harrison Street Bridge, which carries the highway's westbound traffic. U.S. Highway 20 runs roughly parallel to the river on its left bank from Corvallis to Albany.\n\n[9] River Erme: After leaving the national park, the river continues southward, passing through the centre of the town of Ivybridge where it formed the source of the town's prosperity by powering a grist mill, a paper mill and a fulling and tucking mill. In 1813 the only bridge over the river in the village (as it was then) was the inspiration for J. M. W. Turner's painting \"The Ivy Bridge\".\n\n[10] River Rother, West Sussex: After another loop to the north, the river passes between Easebourne to the north east and Midhurst to the south west. The bridge which carries the A272 road has two wide arches, and was of ashlar construction. Although this structure is still in situ, it is difficult to see, as a pedestrian bridge has been built on the north west side, attached to the original bridge by cantilevers, and one of the two arches was widened in 1912 by the addition of another arch outside it. Below the bridge is the mill house and adjoining water mill of North Mill. The mill carries the date 1840, and the house is of a similar age, although built in two stages. The river flows briefly to the south, passing Cowdray on the east bank, which is a scheduled ancient monument. It consists of a medieval fortified house, which is partly ruined, although some of it has been reused. It is situated within Cowdray Park, a grade II* listed landscaped park, which forms the grounds for Cowdray House, a nineteenth-century mansion some further east. On the opposite bank is a motte-and-bailey castle, dating from the twelfth century. Below this point, the river was navigable.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Whitmore Jr.: In 2002 the Virginia Museum of Natural History awarded Whitmore the Thomas Jefferson Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Natural Science. This award is annually presented to an individual who has consistently made outstanding contributions to natural history. Two fossil cetaceans are named after Whitmore in his honor: the large squalodontid \"Squalodon whitmorei\", and the early toothless mysticete \"Eomysticetus whitmorei\". Whitmore died at age 96 at his home on March 18, 2012.\n\n[3] Frank C. Whitmore Jr.: Whitmore was born at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 17, 1915, to Marin Gertrude (Mason) and Frank Clifford Whitmore, then a graduate student at Harvard University and later a prominent chemist. In 1934, Whitmore enrolled as an English major at Amherst College, Massachusetts. To complete his science requirement Whitmore took historical geology taught by F. B. Loomis. Whitmore was the only student who signed up so Loomis geared the class heavily on vertebrate evolution, his research interest. By the end of that year, Whitmore decided he wanted to be a vertebrate paleontologist.\"\n\n[4] Frank C. Whitmore Jr.: Whitmore became a fellow of the Geological Society of America in 1947, and served on its Penrose Medal Committee and as its Penrose citationist. Three years later, he became a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, eventually serving as section secretary and chairman, councilor, and chair of the Newcomb Cleveland Prize Committee.\n\n[5] Frank C. Whitmore: Whitmore was very active in the American Chemical Society (ACS), holding several different offices in the organization throughout his life. In 1938, he served as president of ACS. During his presidency, he visited 72 of 104 local ACS sections. In 1937, Whitmore won the prized William H. Nichols Medal Award, given by the New York section of ACS. In 1945, Whitmore was awarded the Willard Gibbs Medal (considered to be the highest chemical honor in America) by the Chicago section of ACS.\n\n[6] 27th International Emmy Awards: The prestigious Directorate Award, which was bestowed by Walter Cronkite, went to entertainment veteran Ralph Baruch, a founder of media conglom Viacom and an active leader in cultural affairs and diverse media organizations. The Founders Award was bestowed on Fuji TV’s president Hisashi Hieda in recognition of his accomplishments at the helm of the Japanese broadcaster, while the UNICEF Award went to Brazil’s Culture TV.\n\n[7] Frank C.

It comprises a rotating power-driven hub, to which are attached several radial airfoil-section blades such that the whole assembly rotates about a longitudinal axis. Three types of aviation engines used to power propellors include reciprocating engines (or piston engines), gas turbine engines, and electric motors. The amount of thrust a propeller creates is determined by its disk area—the area in which the blades rotate. If the area is too small, efficiency is poor, and if the area is large, the propeller must rotate at a very low speed to avoid going supersonic and creating a lot of noise, and not much thrust. Because of this limitation, propellers are favored for planes thattravel at below Mach 0.6, while jets are a better choice above that speed. Propeller engines may be quieter than jet engines (though not always) and may cost less to purchase or maintain and so remain common on light general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna 172. Larger modern propeller planes, such as the Dash 8, use a jet engine to turn the propeller, primarily because an equivalent piston engine in power output would be much larger and more complex.\n\n[2] Components of jet engines: Most commercial aircraft and large military transport airplanes usually use what is called an auxiliary power unit (APU). It is normally a small gas turbine. Thus, one could say that using such an APU is using a small gas turbine to start a larger one. Low pressure (), high volume air from the compressor section of the APU is bled off through a system of pipes to the engines where it is directed into the starting system. This \"bleed air\" is directed into a mechanism to start the engine turning and begin pulling in air. The starter is usually an air turbine type, similar to the cartridge starter, but uses the APU's bleed air instead of the burning gases of the propellant cartridge. Most cart starters can also use APU air to turn them. When the rotating speed of the engine is sufficient to pull in enough air to support combustion, fuel is introduced and ignited. Once the engine ignites and reaches idle speed, the bleed air and ignition systems are shut off.\n\n[3] Supercharger: A supercharger compresses the air back to sea-level-equivalent pressures, or even much higher, in order to make the engine produce just as much power at cruise altitude as it does at sea level. With the reduced aerodynamic drag at high altitude and the engine still producing rated power, a supercharged airplane can fly much faster at altitude than a naturally aspirated one. The pilot controls the output of the supercharger with the throttle and indirectly via the propeller governor control. Since the size of the supercharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the supercharger is oversized for low altitude. The pilot must be careful with the throttle and watch the manifold pressure gauge to avoid overboosting at low altitude. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the pilot must continuously open the throttle in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the throttle reaches full open and the engine is still producing full rated power is known as the critical altitude. Above the critical altitude, engine power output will start to drop as the aircraft continues to climb.\n\n[4] Allison V-1710: Later, as purpose-built V8 engines became available for drag racing and unlimited boats shifted to turboshaft power, tractor pullers began using the Allison engine, again developing unimagined power. Finally, the warbird movement began to restore and return to the air examples of the classic fighters of the war and many V-1710-powered pursuit airplanes began to fly again, with freshly overhauled engines. The reliability, maintainability, and availability of the engine has led others to use it to power flying examples of aircraft whose original engines are unobtainable. This includes newly manufactured Russian Yak-3 and Yak-9 airplanes, originally powered by Klimov V-12s in World War II and the two (so far) airworthy examples of the Ilyushin Il-2, taking the place of the Mikulin V-12 it originally used, as well as ambitious projects such as a replica Douglas World Cruiser and Focke-Wulf Fw 190D by Flug Werk of Germany.\n\n[5] Turbine engine failure: Turbine engines in use on today's turbine-powered aircraft are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging in the thousands of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine to be shut down in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. The prompt landing is a precaution against the risk that another engine will fail later in the flight or that the engine failure that has already occurred may have caused or been caused by other as-yet unknown damage or malfunction of aircraft systems (such as fire or damage to aircraft flight controls) that may pose a continuing risk to the flight. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its parking position. Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.\n\n[6] Wankel engine: The first Wankel rotary-engine aircraft was the experimental Lockheed Q-Star civilian version of the United States Army's reconnaissance QT-2, basically a powered Schweizer sailplane, in the late 1960s. The plane was powered by a Curtiss-Wright RC2-60 Wankel rotary engine. The same engine model was also used in a Cessna Cardinal and a helicopter, as well as other airplanes. In Germany in the mid-1970s, a pusher ducted fan airplane powered by a modified NSU multi-rotor Wankel engine was developed in both civilian and military versions, Fanliner and Fantrainer.\n\n[7] Tupolev ANT-9: In September 1930, testing of the Wright-powered version of the ANT-9 was completed. A few were used as executive transports for the Soviet Air Forces. A military variant with standard and retractable turrets was under construction, but was abandoned before trials began. An ambulance version was studied and considered, but never built. In 1932, GVF engineer Sergei Ivanovich Komarov proposed a modification of the ANT-9 wing to accommodate two M-17 engines, similar to what was done on the R-6. Production began in 1933 as the PS-9 (, passenger airplane). The number of aircraft built amounted to about 70 machines. Up to the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, they served as passenger or staff airplanes mainly on routes in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Afterwards they were used until 1943 as transportation and medical airplanes. One PS-9 was modified into a propaganda aircraft named \"Krokodil (Crocodile)\" with a reptile-like plywood nose.\n\n[8] Petrol engine: The most common way of engine rating is what is known as the brake power, measured at the flywheel, and given in kilowatts (metric) or horsepower (Imperial/USA). This is the actual mechanical power output of the engine in a usable and complete form. The term \"brake\" comes from the use of a brake in a dynamometer test to load the engine. For accuracy, it is important to understand what is meant by usable and complete. For example, for a car engine, apart from friction and thermodynamic losses inside the engine, power is absorbed by the , alternator, and radiator fan, thus reducing the power available at the flywheel to move the car along. Power is also absorbed by the power steering pump and air conditioner (if fitted), but these are not installed for a power output test or calculation. Power output varies slightly according to the energy value of the fuel, the ambient air temperature and humidity, and the altitude. Therefore, there are agreed standards in the USA and Europe on the fuel to use when testing, and engines are rated at (Europe), and (USA) at sea level, . Marine engines, as supplied, usually have no radiator fan, and often no alternator. In such cases the quoted power rating does not allow for losses in the radiator fan and alternator. The SAE in USA, and the ISO in Europe, publish standards on exact procedures, and how to apply corrections for non-standard conditions such as altitude above sea level.\n\n[9] AgustaWestland AW609: The AW609 is powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6C-67A turboshaft engines, which each drive a three-bladed proprotor. These engines possess roughly twice the horsepower of the similarly sized AgustaWestland AW169 helicopter. Both of the engine and proprotor pairs are mounted on a load-bearing rotatable pylon at the wing's ends, allowing the proprotors to be positioned at various angles. In helicopter mode, the proprotors can be positioned between a 75- and 95-degree angle from the horizontal, with 87 degrees being the typical selection for hovering vertically. In airplane mode, the proprotors are rotated forward and locked in position at a zero-degree angle, spinning at 84% RPM. The flight control software reportedly handles much of the complexity of the transitioning between helicopter and airplane modes; automated systems also serve to guide pilots to the correct tilt angle and air speed settings. When flying in airplane mode, the majority of lift is produced by the AW609's wings, which are slightly forward-swept. Both the wing and the main fuselage are made largely of composite materials. The wings feature flaperon control surfaces which are normally automatically controlled; in vertical flight, the flaperons drop to a 66-degree downwards angle to reduce the wing area being encountered by downwash from the proprotors. A high-mounted rudderless vertical stabiliser is attached the rear of the fuselage to stabilise flight while in aircraft mode. In the event of a single engine failure, either engine can provide power to both proprotors via a drive shaft; the AW609 is also capable of autorotation. The AW609 has been designed to develop Full Transport Category/Class 1 performance to operate safely even when flown under single engine conditions. It is equipped with a de-icing system, and is to be certified for\n\n[10] Mozhaysky's airplane: Mozhaysky's airplane was an experimental Russian airplane designed and built by a naval officer, Alexander Mozhaysky (also transliterated as Mozhayski, Mozhaiski and Mozhayskiy). Powered by two steam engines, the monoplane design reputedly made a powered take off assisted by the use of a ramp, flying between near Krasnoye Selo, Russia in 1884.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The station consists of two buildings: the main building on the north (westbound platform) side of the track houses a non-profit group, the south (eastbound platform) side of the tracks houses the ticket office and waiting area and the platform has two ticket vending machines. The present north building was built in 1892 and the present south building was built in 1912. An access tunnel connects the two platforms and, like Cranford, there are historic photographs of Westfield displayed in the tunnel.\n\n[2] Westfield Municipal Building: Westfield Municipal Building is a historic building at 59 Court Street in Westfield, Massachusetts. It presently houses the Westfield city offices and the local district court. It was built in 1889 to house the state normal school (now Westfield State University), serving in that role until its acquisition by the city in 1959. The building was designed by the architectural firm of Hartwell and Richardson. The second partner was William Cummings Richardson, not H. H. Richardson, but the design of this building, only a few years after the latter's death, was strongly influenced by his distinctive style.\n\n[3] Wakefield Westgate railway station: Four years later, Westgate Station was rebuilt at the northern end of the platforms and the former overflow car park. Key aims of the project were nearly doubling station's retail facilities, an improved forecourt area, station management centre, staff offices, a customer information point, a first class waiting room and standard class waiting facilities and the installation of new passenger information technologies and automated ticket barriers to reduce fare evasion. Better pedestrian access to the multi-storey car park and taxi ranks were provided. Few elements of the modernisation programme interfered with the operational railway except for the installation of additional canopies and the replacement footbridge. The old footbridge and some 1960's station buildings were removed. Wakefield Westgate was the first newly-built station on the East Coast Main Line in decades. The programme was an element of the third phase of \"Merchant Gate\" redevelopment scheme and promoted by its backers as being a key part of the area's renewal. Network Rail was appointed by East Coast as the principal contractor for the programme and the Buckingham Group was the design-and-build subcontractor.\n\n[4] Westfield railway station: Westfield station was opened during the expansion of Auckland's suburban railway network; on June 1875 for goods and on 29 August 1887 for passengers. The original station building was just a wooden shelter on the platform. Mount Richmond Domain is nearby. The new station gave access to a shallow bay on Manukau Harbour, which became a popular picnic spot. In 1904 the station was at the western end of Portage Road, Otahuhu; which marks the narrowest point of the Auckland isthmus.\n\n[5] Wakefield station (MBTA): Rail service was introduced to Wakefield in 1845, primarily through the efforts of Thomas Spaulding, a local businessman. The surviving 19th-century Wakefield Station was built in 1889 by the Boston and Maine Railroad, and served as Wakefield Upper Depot, a major stop in the town, which in 1893 had six stations with as many as 60 trains per day. The building is architecturally distinctive in the town as an example of Panel Brick architecture, and was originally augmented by a baggage depot which stood to its south. The building now houses commercial activity, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. The former Lynnfield Centre depot from the Newburyport Railroad line, closed in 1959, is located at the north end of the station. Center Depot, another NRHP-listed station, is about to the east.\n\n[6] East Main Street Historic District (Westfield, New York): East Main Street Historic District is a national historic district located in C Westfield in Chautauqua County, New York. It is an approximately district encompassing 20 buildings and the Westfield Cemetery located along East Main Street. A number of the structures are in the Italianate and Colonial Revival styles. Candlelight Lodge was built in 1851 by a prominent Philadelphia architect as a private home, the property encompassing a good portion of the east half of the Village of Westfield. Candlelight became a lodge in the 1920s and a bed and breakfast in 1986. Candlelight Lodge is a seven bedroom Victorian mansion currently on a two-acre lot in the Village of Westfield. Candlelight also has the Captain Storm House, a Queen Anne Victorian home moved on to this property in 2000 with the assistance of the National Historic Trust and listed on the National Resister of Historic Places.\n\n[7] Westfield, Massachusetts: Only four buildings exceed four stories in height. Until a major fire on January 6, 1952, the Westfield Professional Building covered half a downtown city block and was six stories tall. The entire building was consumed with extensive damage to neighboring buildings because the fire department's ladder and snorkel vehicles weren't tall enough and the building did not have a sprinkler system. Subsequent zoning prohibited virtually all new construction over three stories, even after improvements in fire suppression technologies and vehicles became available. No building is allowed to be taller than the town's firetruck ladders.\n\n[8] Waltham railway station (England): The station site survived largely intact until 2009 when, following a structural survey, it was determined that the Station House was beyond restoration due to water damage in the foundation level and would have to be demolished. The Station House was deconstructed and rebuilt on exactly the same foot print after the footings were raised 4 feet to match the average level of New waltham and many of the original features returned to the exterior. The rebuilt house retains the name of \"Station House\". The former goods yard with 7 new houses built on the original grounds is now called \"Station Mews\" and involving the construction of eight properties (including the station house reconstruction) accessed by a private road, although has not be fully completed to this date by the developer \"Station Mews Development Company\". The original three terraced cottages with outbuildings, adjacent to the up platform and signal box, survive to this day.\n\n[9] Wolverhampton railway station: The present Wolverhampton station dates from 1964-67 when the High Level station was completely rebuilt by the architect Ray Moorcroft as part of the modernisation programme which saw the West Coast Main Line electrified. It consisted of three through platforms (the present platforms 1, 2 and 3). As part of this scheme, most services on the OW&WR route from were diverted here from Low Level (though a few peak-hour trains continued to serve the latter until March 1968); these then continued to Birmingham New Street via the Stour Valley line rather than via the ex-GWR line to Birmingham Snow Hill as before. In the 1980s, a parcels siding was converted into a south-facing bay platform (the present platform 5), and a new north-facing bay was constructed (the present platform 6). In 1987 twelve different horse sculptures by Kevin Atherton, titled \"Iron Horse\", were erected between New Street station and Wolverhampton, including one at the southern end of platforms 2 and 3.\n\n[10] Wakefield Westgate railway station: Starting in 1967, British Rail embarked on an extensive rebuild of the second station, resulting in the removal of the clock tower and most of the station buildings. The station's decorative and elegant frontage and pavilion roof were demolished and replaced with an austere counterpart. The rebuilt station was \"aesthetically inferior to its earlier incarnation, soon proved to be too cramped to cope with a rise in passenger numbers\". It was poorly laid out with few opportunities for retail and other services. Infilling the station forecourt to the level of the first-storey platform provided direct access to the Up platform level but there was no level access to the Down platform except via a barrow crossing.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or \"lek\". They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate.\n\n[2] New Zealand parrot: The three extant species of this family occupy rather different ecological niches, a result of the phylogeographical dynamics of this family. The kakapo is a flightless, nocturnal species, well camouflaged to avoid the large diurnal birds of prey on the island, while the local owls are too small to prey on the kakapo at night. The kakapo is the only flightless bird in the world to use a lek-breeding system. Usually, they breed only every 3–5 years when certain podocarp trees like rimu (\"Dacrydium cupressinum\") mast abundantly.\n\n[3] Andrew Digby: Kakapo Recovery is a project of the New Zealand Department of Conservation utilising the skills of scientists, rangers and volunteers to protect and boost the numbers of the endangered Kakapo, a flightless parrot. From only 18 individuals in the 1970s, the projects breeding and research program has boosted numbers to a population 157 adults living on a predator-free islands. Since February 2016, surviving kākāpō are kept on three predator-free islands, Whenua Hou/Codfish, Anchor and Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier islands, where they are closely monitored. In 2016 a record 47 chicks hatched and 33 were fledged. Digby promoted the idea to crowd fund a project to sequence the genome of every living adult kakapo as well as the genomes of 55 long-dead museum specimens from around the world. This will be the first time genomes will be sequenced for an entire species population and will allow the breeding program to be refined and improved. The Takahē is a stout, flightless bird which was thought extinct but found again in 1948 in the remote Murchison Mountains, Fiordland. Conservation efforts have continued but the birds still remain critically endangered with currently 300 adults known. Digby is the scientist on the Takahē Recovery project giving advice on topics such as population dynamics, genetics, predator-prey interactions, avian diseases, and trials of new transmitters.\n\n[4] Oceania: The birds of New Zealand evolved into an avifauna that included a large number of endemic species. As an island archipelago New Zealand accumulated bird diversity and when Captain James Cook arrived in the 1770s he noted that the bird song was deafening. The mix includes species with unusual biology such as the kakapo which is the world's only flightless, nocturnal, lek breeding parrot, but also many species that are similar to neighboring land areas. Some of the more well known and distinctive bird species in New Zealand are the kiwi, kea, takahe, kakapo, mohua, tui and the bellbird. The tuatara is a notable reptile endemic to New Zealand.\n\n[5] Last Chance to See (TV series): The penultimate programme opens with aerial scenes of New Zealand's Southern Alps as the presenters fly in by helicopter. This was once the natural habitat of the kakapo, a critically endangered flightless parrot now confined to two offshore islands. Kakapo numbers were decimated by predators and Māori hunters, and fewer than 100 remained at the time the episode was filmed (the population is now . See list of kakapo). Later, they are shown a Māori cloak made from kakapo feathers in a Wellington museum. On the North Island, they encounter other New Zealand rarities such as the kiwi and giant weta. They also meet filmmaker Peter Jackson, who confesses to a childhood phobia of wetas. Conservationist Don Merton takes Fry and Carwardine to the Chatham Islands, where the endemic black robin was saved from extinction by eradicating introduced predators. This became the model for kakapo conservation, and Merton now hopes to reintroduce kakapo to Sinbad Gully, a remote Fiordland valley. At Invercargill, they enter quarantine before flying to Codfish Island where researchers are predicting a record kakapo breeding season (they are later proved correct, with 34 eggs hatching). They watch a hand-reared male called Sirocco broadcast his nightly booming calls. After days frustrated by bad weather, Carwardine's efforts to take photographs of Sirocco take an unexpected turn. The kakapo climbs on to his head and attempts to mate with him, much to Fry's amusement. He later gets the privilege of filming a female on her nest. Fry is overwhelmed by the conservation effort dedicated to just one species, describing it as a \"story of human passion and commitment\".\n\n[6] Kakapo: The skeleton of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists of a pair of clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.\n\n[7] Kakapo: The kakapo (Māori: kākāpō) or \"night parrot\", also called owl parrot (\"Strigops habroptilus\"), is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family Strigopoidea, endemic to New Zealand.\n\n[8] Kakapo: Though the kakapo cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also \"parachute\" – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees. With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kakapo cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kakapo is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. When foraging, kakapo tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called \"browse signs\".\n\n[9] Kakapo: The kakapo was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand, and was well adapted to avoid the birds of prey which were their only predators. As well as the New Zealand falcon, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All these raptors soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid them the kakapo evolved camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. When a kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the vegetation its plumage resembles. Kakapo were not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from owl nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that kakapo were among their prey.\n\n[10] South Pacific (TV series): The fifth programme looks at the unusual animal life of the South Pacific. Species have evolved new behaviour to take advantage of ecological niches. On New Guinea, kangaroos such as the dingiso have become arboreal, taking the place of monkeys. The lack of predators on the ground has resulted in more flightless birds than anywhere else on Earth, including the kagu from New Caledonia. The Solomon Islands are home to the monkey-tailed skink, the largest of its kind. Unlike any of its relatives, it has a prehensile tail, forms social bonds and has turned vegetarian. The differing bill shapes of Hawaii’s honeycreepers are used to illustrate how one colonising species can evolve into many specialists. In New Zealand, Fiordland crested penguins raise their chicks in the forests and short-tailed bats behave more like mice, hunting wetas on the ground. The fate of some New Zealand animals illustrates the fragility of island life. The kakapo, once a successful and abundant herbivore, was defenceless against Māori hunters and introduced predators. There are now 70 million Australian possums in New Zealand’s forests, where they out-compete native wildlife. Controlling introduced species is a huge problem across the South Pacific. Wild tuataras can still be found on Stephens Island, but the flightless wren was not so lucky – the last of its kind were killed by pet cats before it was declared a new species. The collapse of the Rapanui civilization on Easter Island shows that human beings are not immune to this precarious existence.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Bees store honey in wax structures called honeycombs. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \"Apis\") is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (granulated sugar). It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. Honey provides 46 calories in a serving of one tablespoon (15 ml). Although generally safe, honey may potentially have adverse effects or interactions upon excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or use of prescription drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity. Cave paintings in Cuevas de la Araña, Spain, depict humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago.\n\n[2] Honey: Instead of taking nectar, bees can take honeydew, the sweet secretions of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, with a rich fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as sweet as nectar honeys. Germany's Black Forest is a well-known source of honeydew-based honeys, as well as some regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia, and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual honey production. Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas, beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger-flavored product.\n\n[3] Western honey bee: Leslie Bailey and B. V. Ball, in their book \"Honey Bee Pathology\", call honey bees \"feral insects\", in contrast to the silkworm (\"Bombyx mori\") which they call \"the only insect that has been domesticated\", and refer to the \"popular belief among many biologists as well as beekeepers that bees are domesticated\". They argue that honey bees are able to survive without man's help, and in fact require to \"be left at liberty\" to survive. They argue further that even if bees could be raised away from the wild, they would still have to fly freely to gather nectar and pollinate plants. Therefore, they argue, bee-keeping is \"the exploitation of colonies of a wild insect\", with little more than the provision of a weatherproof cavity for them to nest in. Pilar de la Rua and colleagues likewise argue that honey bees are not fully domesticated, since \"endemic subspecies-specific genetic footprints can still be identified in Europe and Africa\", making conservation of wild-bee diversity important. They further argue that the difficulty of controlling drones for mating is a serious handicap and a sign that domestication is not complete, in particular as \"extensive gene flow usually occurs between wild/feral and managed honeybee populations\".\n\n[4] Honey: Toxic honey may also result when bees are proximate to tutu bushes (\"Coriaria arborea\") and the vine hopper insect (\"Scolypopa australis\"). Both are found throughout New Zealand. Bees gather honeydew produced by the vine hopper insects feeding on the tutu plant. This introduces the poison tutin into honey. Only a few areas in New Zealand (the Coromandel Peninsula, Eastern Bay of Plenty and the Marlborough Sounds) frequently produce toxic honey. Symptoms of tutin poisoning include vomiting, delirium, giddiness, increased excitability, stupor, coma, and violent convulsions. To reduce the risk of tutin poisoning, humans should not eat honey taken from feral hives in the risk areas of New Zealand. Since December 2001, New Zealand beekeepers have been required to reduce the risk of producing toxic honey by closely monitoring tutu, vine hopper, and foraging conditions within of their apiary. Intoxication is rarely dangerous.\n\n[5] Western honey bee: The European honey bee is the third insect, after the fruit fly and the mosquito, to have its genome mapped. According to scientists who analyzed its genetic code, the honey bee originated in Africa and spread to Europe in two ancient migrations. Scientists have found that genes related to smell outnumber those for taste, and the European honey bee has fewer genes regulating immunity than the fruit fly and the mosquito. The genome sequence also revealed that several groups of genes, particularly those related to circadian rhythm, resembled those of vertebrates more than other insects. Another significant finding from the honey bee genome study, was that the honey bee was the first insect to be discovered with a functional DNA methylation system since functional key enzymes (DNA methyltransferase-1 and -3) were identified in the genome. DNA methylation is one of the important mechanisms in epigenetics to study gene expression and regulation without changing the DNA sequence, but modifications on DNA activity. DNA methylation later was identified to play an important role in gene regulation and gene splicing. The genome is unusual in having few transposable elements, although they were present in the evolutionary past (remains and fossils have been found) and evolved more slowly than those in fly-species.\n\n[6] Human interactions with insects: Honey bee products are used medicinally in apitherapy across Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas, despite the fact that the honey bee was not introduced to the Americas until the colonization by Spain and Portugal. They are by far the most common medical insect product both historically and currently, and the most frequently referenced of these is honey. It can be applied to skin to treat excessive scar tissue, rashes, and burns, and as an eye poultice to treat infection. Honey is taken for digestive problems and as a general health restorative. It is taken hot to treat colds, cough, throat infections, laryngitis, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. Apitoxin (honey bee venom) is applied via direct stings to relieve arthritis, rheumatism, polyneuritis, and asthma. Propolis, a resinous, waxy mixture collected by honeybees and used as a hive insulator and sealant, is often consumed by menopausal women because of its high hormone content, and it is said to have antibiotic, anesthetic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Royal jelly is used to treat anaemia, gastrointestinal ulcers, arteriosclerosis, hypo- and hypertension, and inhibition of sexual libido. Finally Bee bread, or bee pollen, is eaten as a generally health restorative, and is said to help treat both internal and external infections. One of the major peptides in bee venom, Melittin, has the potential to treat inflammation in sufferers of Rheumatoid arthritis and Multiple sclerosis.\n\n[7] Honey bee: A honey bee (or honeybee) is a eusocial, flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade. They are known for construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax, for the large size of their colonies, and for their surplus production and storage of honey, distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers. In the early 21st century, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically seven to eleven species are recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination; modern humans also value the wax for candlemaking and other crafts. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \"Apis\" are true honey bees. The study of bees, which includes the study of honey bees, is known as melittology.\n\n[8] Pine honey: Pine honey is an unusual honey because it is not produced entirely by honey bees . It is produced by bees that collect honeydew (sugary secretions) from a scale insect species called \"Marchalina hellenica\", which lives on the sap of certain pine trees. The \"marchalina hellenica\" can be found on the Turkish Pine (\"Pinus brutia\"), as well as the Aleppo Pine (\"Pinus halepensis\"), Austrian Pine (\"Pinus nigra\"), Scots Pine (\"Pinus sylvestris\") and Stone Pine (\"Pinus pinea\").\n\n[9] Polistes annularis: \"P. annularis\" was the first wasp which did not form large colonies to be observed storing honey in the autumn. The wasps store the honey over the winter to facilitate their survival in colder months and assist in the recognition of sisters, which will help construct new nests near their original one. The caching begins in early to midautumn, after which time the wasps retreat from the nest to hibernacula when the temperature drops below about 5 °C. They return to the nests when the weather permits, such as on warmer days. This behavior exposes \"P. annularis\" to attack from other insects of the same species, wasps of other species, such as those of the genus \"Vespula\", and from mammals. However, \"Polistes\" species have evolved to hide their nests from most mammals or put them in areas as to make them inaccessible. Invading insects are attacked. Despite the fact that birds are common enemies of polistine wasps, none has been observed attacking nests for honey. The wasps may either gorge on the honey, or ration it, given that they are social insects. Additionally, wasps with nests containing honey are significantly more likely to survive the cold winter than those wasps whose nests do not contain honey.\n\n[10] Brachygastra: The diet of Honey wasps is made up of carbohydrates from nectar and honey, and protein attained from predation upon various insects such as beetles, weevils, lepidopterans, aphids and various larvae. They have a wide feeding flexibility, probably due to the seasonal availability floral nectar and insect prey. Floral nectar and insect protein are both stored within the comb of the nest. \"Brachygastra mellifica\" and \"B\". \"lecheguana\" are well known for their large stores of nectar. \"B. azteca\" also stores nectar but in smaller quantities. In addition to nectar, species often collect honeydew from honey-dew producing cercopids and nymphal membracids. The nectar gathering activity of these wasp species allows them to provide pollination services to some plant types, such as myrtaceae in the Cerrado, sunflower (\"Helianthus annuus\" L., Asteraceae) and mesquite in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Avocado. Additionally, honey wasps benefit some plant species by preying upon endophytic herbivorous insects. Damaged plants release volatile compounds that act as chemical and olfactory cues for predatory \"Brachygastra\" species, attracting them to the source of the grazing herbivorous insect. They have been observed attacking many insect pest species such as Asian citrus psyllid, (\"Diaphorina citri)\", tomato leafminer (\"Tuta absoluta),\" cotton boll weevil larvae, (\"Anthonomus grandis)\" and the white coffee leaf miner larvae (\"Perileucoptera coffeella)\", suggesting that they have potential to be used as a biological control agent for human crops.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The artwork, which depicts a younger incarnation of 'the muscles from Brussels' in a fighting pose, was commissioned to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Westland Shopping complex. The unveiling took place on Boulevard Sylvain Dupuis and was attended by Van Damme, his parents, Wallonia-Brussels culture minister Fadila Laanan and nearly 2,000 fans. Van Damme said the statue \"represented the dream of a Brussels kid\" and was \"for all the children who want something bad\", adding that \"if you believe in something strongly enough, it can come true\".\n\n[2] The Brussels Business: The Brussels Business is a documentary film by Friedrich Moser and Matthieu Lietaert about the lack of transparency and the influence of lobbyists on the decision-making process in Brussels, the European Union capital. It also underlines the instrumental role of the European Roundtable of Industrialists in the making of the Single Market as well as the construction of the European Services Forum, a core actor in the structuration of the service industry lobbying in Brussels. The film has been very popular in Brussels and Austria and is going to be Screened in other European Union theaters.\n\n[3] Michael Des Barres: Des Barres has appeared in over 100 different TV shows and almost 30 movies in his career. He first started acting at 8 years old as 'The Nux Bar Kid' on posters all over England. He appeared (uncredited) in the 1966 film starring Tony Curtis, \"Drop Dead Darling\". His first credited film role was as a supporting cast member in the classic 1967 film \"To Sir, with Love\", playing an East End pupil who always wears dark sunglasses indoors and out, followed by a few other minor roles before he decided to pursue a career in music instead. He later concentrated his energies on acting again and was cast in \"Ghoulies\" (1985) as cult leader Malcolm Graves, and \"Nightflyers\" (1987) as a charismatic empath. He worked opposite Clint Eastwood in 1989's \"Pink Cadillac\". His other film roles have included \"Midnight Cabaret\" (1990), \"Under Siege\" (1992), \"\" (1992), \"A Simple Twist of Fate\" (1994), and \"Sugar Town\" (1999). He also appeared in the 2004 film \"Catch That Kid\" and had a brief part in David Lynch's classic 2001 film \"Mulholland Drive\".\n\n[4] Charles Bates (actor): Charles Bates (born January 15, 1935) is a former American child actor. He appeared in about 43 films between 1941 and 1952, mostly in small roles. He is probably best known as young Roger Newton in Alfred Hitchcock's thriller \"Shadow of a Doubt\" (1943). Other notable roles include \"The North Star\" (1943), \"San Diego, I Love You\" (1944), \"Pursued\" (1947) and \"Shockproof\" (1949). His last film was \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\", where he played Gregory Peck's character as a 17-year-old.\n\n[5] Samson Burke: Burke earned a college degree in physical education. He wrestled and swam for Canada in the 1948 Summer Olympics. In the 1950s, Burke wrestled for nine years under the names \"Sammy Berg\" and \"Mr Canada\", and sparred with such luminaries as Primo Carnera, Antonino Rocca, Lou Thesz and Joe Lewis. His friend Gordon Mitchell recommended Burke for the lead role of Ursus in the 1961 film \"The Revenge of Ursus\". Burke next appeared opposite Italian comedian Totò in \"Toto vs. Maciste\". Norman Maurer then chose him to portray the mythical Greek hero Hercules in \"The Three Stooges Meet Hercules\". As the sword and sandal craze faded, Burke played Little John in an Italian \"The Triumph of Robin Hood\", Polyphemus in a 1968 Italian miniseries of \"The Odyssey\", a villain in a Kommissar X film \"\" (\"Death Trip\"), Harald Reinl's \"Nibelungenlied\" films, and appeared alongside Gianni Garko and Klaus Kinski in both a spaghetti western \"Sartana the Gravedigger\" and a miniature imitation \"The Dirty Dozen\" war film \"Five for Hell\".\n\n[6] Charlie Becker: Becker appeared in a few films during the 1920s and 1930s. These included \"Spangles\" (1926), \"The Terror of Tiny Town\" (1938), and, most notably, \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939), in which he played the Mayor of Munchkinland. He was chosen for the role because of his large belly, round face, and facial hair, which were thought to be mayoral features. Because of his thick German accent, however, his voice had to be dubbed. On the set of \"The Wizard of Oz\", Becker met his future wife, Jessie Kelley, who played another Munchkin. She was originally from Mahaska, Kansas. The two married in 1940, moved to Washington, Kansas for a short time and later settled in California, where they sometimes worked as stand-ins for child actors. Later in his life, Becker opened his own sausage business.\n\n[7] Jurassic World: The computer-generated creatures, including those seen in the park's petting zoo, were created with motion capture using human actors to perform the animals' movements, marking the first time that motion capture technology had been used in the making of a dinosaur film. Trevorrow said, \"We got to build everyone from the ground up because technology has changed so much that everything is a rebuild\". New technology such as subsurface scattering allowed the creatures' skin and muscle tissue to be given additional detail that could not be achieved in the earlier films. As with previous films in the series, actors had to imagine many of the film's creatures, which were digitally added during post-production. Actors were aided by cardboard cut-outs and tennis balls on sticks, all of which represented the creatures that would later be added into the film. ILM used its V-scout application, which used an iPad to digitally depict dinosaur models in the filming environment, to further aid the actors. ILM also used the V-scout during location scouting.\n\n[8] Lucien De Roeck: De Roeck experienced the peak of his career during the 1950s. In 1954 he won the design competition for the poster of the World Fair of 1958. He used an asymmetrical star in the center of the design, combined with a globe in the right upper corner. The star has the city hall of Brussels in the middle. The five points stand for the visitors of the 5 continents Brussels would welcome, as well as the number of decennia Congo was a colony of Belgium. The typography exists of ‘Brussels’ and ‘58’ and the colors used are blue and green which suggest heaven and earth.\n\n[9] Bill Schmeisser: He was born on August 4, 1880 in Baltimore, Maryland and attended high school at Baltimore City College, from which he graduated in 1899. He received his undergraduate college education at Johns Hopkins University and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1902. While at Hopkins, Schmeisser played as a defenseman on the lacrosse team from 1900 to 1902. He was also a member of the Beta Mu chapter of Phi Gamma Delta.\n\n[10] Paul Henckels: Although his father was Jewish and he was considered a \"Half-Jew\" by the rules of the Nazis, Henckels was still allowed to work during the Third Reich, mainly because of the help of his friend Gustaf Gründgens and his popularity as a character actor. He was well known for his eccentric, colourful roles and his trademark Rhineland accent. Among his most popular roles were the school teacher Professor Bömmel in \"Die Feuerzangenbowle\" (1944) and the veterinarian Dr. Pudlich in the \"Immenhof film series\" during the 1950s. He was also notable as a stage actor and appeared at the Schauspielhaus Berlin for many years. His most popular stage role was Wibbel the Tailor which he played more than 1000 times.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWho was the first First Lady to be received privately by the Pope?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Melania Trump: When the President and First Lady visited Vatican City in May 2017, she said that she is a Catholic. She is the first Catholic to live in the White House since President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline and the second Catholic First Lady of the United States. \"During their visit to the Vatican...the pope blessed the first lady’s rosary beads, and the two had a lighthearted conversation about what she feeds her husband. She spent time in front of a statue of the Madonna at the Vatican’s children’s hospital and laid flowers at its feet.\"\n\n[2] Office of the First Lady of the United States: Though the persona, activities, and initiatives of the First Lady have always been significant to the history of the United States, the first First Lady to hire federally funded staff was Edith Roosevelt, who hired Belle Hagner as the first White House Social Secretary on October 2, 1901. Eleanor Roosevelt became the first First Lady to expand the office beyond social and administrative secretaries by hiring Malvina Thompson as her personal secretary and Jackie Kennedy was the first to employ a Press Secretary.\n\n[3] 1977 National Women's Conference: The position of First Lady, which originally consisted of being a good hostess to guests of the president, has become more politicized as women began to receive more rights and more access to power. Martha Washington, who several consider to be the first First Lady, was often referred to as Lady Washington because of her social standing and was known for being a lovely hostess to guests of the White House. Dolley Madison, wife of former president James Madison, was the first woman in this position to use her political power to push for change, thus becoming the basis for the modern day First Lady. Several First Ladies from the late nineteenth century aligned themselves with various political movements, such as temperance and war, but few were known for their active political involvement. It wasn't until 1932, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected into office, that the idea of a politically active First Lady began to form. Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, became an important figure of the Great Depression and the Second World War because of her dedication to her country and her interest in social and political issues. Although there were several First Ladies who actively supported the country, none of them did so with the passion and commitment of Mrs. Roosevelt, who would often appear on the radio and in press conferences and had a friendly and comforting demeanor. Roosevelt is seen as a feminist icon to this day because of her use of political power to drive change.\n\n[4] Mariology of the popes: Pacelli was consecrated archbishop in the Sistine Chapel by Pope Benedict XV on May 13, 1917, the same day as the first purported apparition of Our Lady of Fatima. His Secretary of State, Cardinal Luigi Maglione would later say that the Pope had been deeply moved by the parallel of his episcopal consecration and the apparition in Fatima. Referring to his episcopal consecration Pope Pius said:Cardinal Tedeschini, who was present at the consecration in 1917, added his view to the coincidence: \"The pontificate of Pius XII is focused on Fatima, May 13. It was our Lady of Fatima, who connected with the person and future of Eugenio Pacelli, having him consecrated through the hands of Pope Benedict XV to the fullness of priesthood at the very day and hour, in which the Most Blessed Virgin with her messages first descended to Fatima. May 13 is engraved in all our hearts, how much more in the heart of this Pope.\n\n[5] Mialy Rajoelina: Like her husband, Mialy is a Roman Catholic, in April 2013 she and Andry met with Pope Francis to become the first African head and first lady to be received by the new pope at that time.\n\n[6] Alfred Xuereb: In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Xuereb as successor to secretary Mieczysław Mokrzycki as his second private secretary. He accompanied the Pope on his trips. After the election of Pope Francis in 2013, Xuereb became his first private secretary. Though Xuereb was the official first secretary it was assumed that the real private secretary of the pope was Fabián Pedacchio, who was at that point officially the second secretary.\n\n[7] First Lady or First Gentleman of the Philippines: Victoria Quirino-Gonzalez was the First Lady for her father, Elpidio Quirino. However Victoria is regarded as the first to be named with the role \"First Lady\". The spouses of the presidents, from Emilio Aguinaldo to Manuel Roxas, were not given the title during their respective husbands' terms.\n\n[8] Angelo Amato: After the 2005 Papal conclave, Amato was the first person received in private audience by the new Pope Benedict XVI, who until his election had been Prefect of the Congregation of which Amato continued to be Secretary until 9 July 2008, when Pope Benedict named him Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Thus, Amato oversees the process which leads to the canonisation of saints, which includes preparing a case, including the approval of certified miracles. The case is presented to the pope, who decides whether or not to proceed with beatification or canonisation. Amato is the second CDF Secretary to lead the Causes of Saints dicastery, the first being Alberto Bovone.\n\n[9] Presidency of Joseph Estrada: The First Lady, Mrs. Loi Ejercito, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 15 October 1998 her private foundation—the Partnership for the Poor Foundation, Inc. which provides relief and livelihood to the poor. A few months after its incorporation, the foundation received P100 million from the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office as donation. The donation far exceeded the PCSO's combined donation of P65 million to regular beneficiaries like orphanages and hospitals. The complainants consider this a conflict-of-interest. The donation of government funds to the private foundation of the First Lady was also found to have been delivered to their legal residence in San Juan.\n\n[10] List of First Ladies of the United States: There are four living former First Ladies: Rosalynn Carter, married to Jimmy Carter; Hillary Clinton, married to Bill Clinton; Laura Bush, married to George W. Bush, and Michelle Obama, married to Barack Obama. The first First Lady was Martha Washington, married to George Washington. Presidents John Tyler and Woodrow Wilson had two official First Ladies; both remarried during their presidential tenures. The wives of four Presidents died before their husbands were sworn into office but are still considered First Ladies by the White House and National First Ladies' Library: Martha Wayles Skelton, married to Thomas Jefferson; Rachel Jackson, married to Andrew Jackson; Hannah Van Buren, married to Martin Van Buren; and Ellen Lewis Herndon Arthur, married to Chester A. Arthur. One woman who was not married to a President is still considered an official First Lady: Harriet Lane, niece of bachelor James Buchanan. The other non-spousal relatives who served as White House hostesses are not recognized by the First Ladies' Library.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the purpose of business valuation?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Business valuation: Business valuation is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the economic value of an owner's interest in a business. Valuation is used by financial market participants  to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business. In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest. In some cases, the court would appoint a forensic accountant as the joint expert doing the business valuation.\n\n[2] Business valuation: A business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates. A common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's Beige Book, published eight times a year by the Federal Reserve Bank. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.\n\n[3] Business valuation: Three different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach. Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.\n\n[4] Business valuation: The value of asset-based analysis of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to fair market value wherever possible. The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall enterprise value. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the fair market value of the business. In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.\n\n[5] Valuation (finance): It is possible and conventional for financial professionals to make their own estimates of the valuations of assets or liabilities that they are interested in. Their calculations are of various kinds including analyses of companies that focus on price-to-book, price-to-earnings, price-to-cash-flow and present value calculations, and analyses of bonds that focus on credit ratings, assessments of default risk, risk premia, and levels of real interest rates. All of these approaches may be thought of as creating estimates of value that compete for credibility with the prevailing share or bond prices, where applicable, and may or may not result in buying or selling by market participants. Where the valuation is for the purpose of a merger or acquisition the respective businesses make available further detailed financial information, usually on the completion of a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n[6] Business valuation standard: Business Valuation Standards (BVS) are codes of practice that are used in business valuation. The major business appraisal standards are these: In addition, each of the three major United States valuation societies — the American Society of Appraisers (ASA), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPA/ABV), and the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts (NACVA) — has its own set of Business Valuation Guidelines, which it requires all of its accredited members to adhere to. The AICPA's standards are published as Statement on Standards for Valuation Services No.1 and the ASA's guidelines are published as the \"ASA Business Valuation Guidelines, which largely follow the USPAP Standard requirements\". All AICPA members are required to follow SSVS1. Additionally, the majority of the State Accountancy Boards have adopted SSVS1 for CPAs licensed in their state.\n\n[7] Real prices and ideal prices: Consequently, what the \"real\" price of a thing is, might be a topic of dispute, because it may involve conditions and \"valuation criteria\" which some would not accept, because they apply different valuation criteria, different conditions or have a different purpose. For example, an asset or product may be valued by accountants and statisticians at:A price can be computed for each of these valuations, depending on one's purpose. Often the purpose is assumed to be self-evident, being related to a specific transaction, and thus what the price of something is, is taken as obvious. But an object or activity can in reality be priced in many different ways, depending on what valuation is relevant, or what price is negotiated. In modern banking, there are literally hundreds of additional conventions used to value assets under a variety of conditions.\n\n[8] Valuation (finance): In finance, valuation analysis is required for many reasons including tax assessment, wills and estates, divorce settlements, business analysis, and basic bookkeeping and accounting. Since the value of things fluctuates over time, valuations are as of a specific date like the end of the accounting quarter or year. They may alternatively be mark-to-market estimates of the current value of assets or liabilities as of this minute or this day for the purposes of managing portfolios and associated financial risk (for example, within large financial firms including investment banks and stockbrokers).\n\n[9] Business Analysis and Valuation: Business Analysis and Valuation Using Financial Statements: Text and Cases is a textbook by Krishna Palepu and Paul Healy, which is widely used in worldwide MBA programs and finance courses. It is in its 5th edition, and also has an IFRS edition. The fifth edition was released August 2012. The book won the Notable Contribution to the Accounting Literature Award for impact on academic research. It also won the American Accounting Association’s Wildman Award for its impact on management practice. It has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish. The book is sold with a business analysis and valuation software model published by the Harvard Business School Publishing Company.\n\n[10] Business valuation: The income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine fair market value by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into present value. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or cash flows, discounted future cash flows (\"DCF\"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the fair market value of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies. IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60 states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Its role was to encourage the use of academic dress and to encourage excellence in the execution of academic ceremonial; to this end, it assigned academic dress to its own members. Membership was based on the academic degrees or professional qualifications held by members, and also included Honorary Life Member (HonCIL) and Companion (CompCIL) as honorary awards, Companion being the highest award and limited to a maximum of one new Companion per year. In the sixteen years of the Institute's existence, there were only three elected CompCIL:Due to falling membership numbers, its activities were permanently suspended in 2005 and members encouraged to join The Burgon Society.\n\n[2] Imperial College London: The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute, formed by the City of London's livery companies, was opened on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales, founded to focus on providing technical education, with courses starting in early 1885. The institution was renamed the Central Technical College in 1893, becoming a school of the University of London in 1900. At the start of the 20th century there was a concern that Britain was falling behind its key rivals – particularly Germany – in scientific and technical education, and the idea grew for a \"British Charlottenburg\", similar to the German \"Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg\". In 1902, the Technical Education Board of London County Council called for the establishment of a similar institute for advanced technological training in London, and Richard Haldane had involved  Lord Rosebery, Arthur Balfour and the Duke of Devonshire in a scheme to raise £600,000 as a trust fund for the proposed institution.\n\n[3] Central School of Art and Design: The Central School of Art and Design was a public school of fine and applied arts in London, England. It offered foundation and degree level courses. It was established in 1896 by the London County Council as the Central School of Arts and Crafts. Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and in 1989 merged with Saint Martin's School of Art to form Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design.\n\n[4] Central Saint Martins: The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by London County Council. It grew directly from the Arts and Crafts movement of William Morris and John Ruskin. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was William Richard Lethaby; a blue plaque in his memory was erected in 1957. The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the Regent Street Polytechnic. It moved to purpose-built premises in Southampton Row, in the London Borough of Camden, in 1908. In the same year the Royal Female School of Art, established in 1842, was merged into the school. Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin's in 1989.\n\n[5] Central Saint Martins: Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 from the merger of the Central School of Art and Design, founded in 1896, and Saint Martin's School of Art, founded in 1854. Since 1986 both schools had been part of the London Institute, formed by the Inner London Education Authority to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools. The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted university status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004. It also includes Camberwell College of Arts, Chelsea College of Arts, the London College of Communication, the London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of Arts.\n\n[6] City and Guilds of London Institute: Unable at once to find a large enough site within the City of London for their Central Institution, the CGLI occupied a building on land alongside Exhibition Road in South Kensington, although its headquarters were in Gresham College in the City. At the time John Watney was both secretary to the Gresham Committee and the CGLI. Evening classes were offered at a school in Cowper Street, off City Road, enabling instruction in chemistry and physics to be provided to those who wished to continue their education after working during the day. The school proved such a success that new premises had to be found in nearby Leonard Street, which was formally opened on 19 February 1893 as Finsbury Technical College. The Institute's director at the time was Sir Philip Magnus, later University MP. Finsbury College was intended as the first of a number of feeder colleges for the Central Institution, but was almost the only one founded. Finsbury College continued its separate existence until 1926.\n\n[7] Imperial College London: A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, originally chaired by Francis Mowatt and (from 1905) by Haldane, officially to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. An interim report in 1905 asked if the government would support the unification of the two national schools of science in South Kensington – the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines – into a single institution. This was followed in 1906 by the final report that called for the establishment of this unified institution, also to take in – if agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute – their Central Technical College. The committee was divided on whether the new institution should be incorporated into the University of London or be associated as a independent college of the university, but recommended that the establishment of the new institution should not wait for this question to be settled.\n\n[8] Institute of technology: Britain's first polytechnic, the Royal Polytechnic Institution later known as the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) was established in 1838 at Regent Street in London and its goal was to educate and popularize engineering and scientific knowledge and inventions in Victorian Britain \"at little expense.\" The London Polytechnic led a mass movement to create numerous polytechnic institutes across the UK in the late 19th century. Most polytechnic institutes were established at the centre of major metropolitan cities and their focus was on engineering, applied science and technology education.\n\n[9] UCL Institute of Education: As a result of the report of the McNair Committee, which was established by the Board of Education to examine recruitment and training of teachers and youth leaders a new scheme for teacher training was established in England. \"Area Training Organisations\" (ATO) were created to co-ordinate the provision of teacher training and were responsible for the overall administration of all colleges of education within their area. The ATO for the London area was based at the University of London under the name University of London, Institute of Education, which was responsible for around 30 existing colleges of education and education departments, including the existing Institute of Education. The colleges (known as \"constituent colleges\" of the Institute) prepared students for the \"Certificate in Education\" of the Institute, and latterly for the Bachelor of Education and Bachelor of Humanities degrees of the University. The existing Institute (referred to as the \"Central Institute\") and the new ATO (referred to as the \"Wider Institute\") had separate identities, but confusingly were administered from the same building and by the same administrate staff. This dual identity continued until the Wider Institute gradually disappeared and was finally dissolved in 1975, coinciding with the closure (or \"merger\" with local polytechnics and other institutions) of many of the colleges of education.\n\n[10] Leo Baeck Institute: The \"Leo Baeck Institute London\", founded in 1955, researches the history and culture of German-speaking Jewry from the 17th century to the present day. The Institute aims both to facilitate academic exchange and to use the German and Central European Jewish experience from the 17th to the 21st centuries to help understand contemporary socio-political debates concerning immigration, minorities, integration, and civil rights, in particular in the UK. Its teaching and research capacity expanded significantly with the Institute’s move from its historic home in central London to Queen Mary, University of London, in 2011. Since then the LBI London has established European Jewish History as a teaching and research field at the School of History at Queen Mary. The LBI London remains an independent institute. It is a registered charity under English law.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

President John F. Kennedy spontaneously spared a turkey on November 18, 1963, just four days before his assassination. The bird was wearing a sign reading, \"Good Eating Mr. President\". Kennedy returned the massive turkey to the farm, saying \"we'll let this one grow.\" Scattered reports in \"The Washington Post\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" referred to it as a pardon, but Kennedy did not refer to it as such. Likewise, Richard Nixon also spared some of the turkeys given to him during his time as President. Jimmy Carter refused to take part in the presentation and rejected the turkeys given to him. First Lady Rosalynn Carter arranged to have the turkeys sent to petting zoos.\n\n[2] President of the United States: Other presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children. Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\n\n[3] National Turkey Federation: Among members of the general public, NTF is best known for its role in the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation, an annual ceremony where a live domestic turkey is presented to the President of the United States just before Thanksgiving Day. NTF began presenting the National Thanksgiving Turkey during the presidency of Harry Truman. The custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey started with Bush I in 1989, Two birds are brought to the White House for final selection and the President invariably grants a \"pardon\" to both birds.\n\n[4] National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation: National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation is a ceremony that takes place at the White House every year shortly before Thanksgiving. The President of the United States is presented with a live domestic turkey by the National Turkey Federation, usually of the Broad Breasted White variety. The birds are usually males selected for appearance, strut and gobbling sounds. Although there’s much speculation over just who started the poultry pardon tradition, the National Turkey Federation (NFT) gave the credit former President George H.W. Bush.\n\n[5] National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation: The first President on record issuing a \"pardon\" to his turkey was Ronald Reagan. Reagan had been sending the turkeys presented to him to farms and zoos since at least 1982, and 1987's turkey, Charlie, was likewise headed to a petting zoo. At the time, Reagan was facing questions over the Iran-Contra affair, on whether or not he would consider pardoning Oliver North (who had yet to be tried for his involvement in the affair); Reagan conjured the notion of the turkey pardon as a joke to deflect those questions. Reagan did not make any pardon references in the 1988 presentation, but his successor, George H. W. Bush, instituted the turkey pardon as a permanent part of the presentation beginning his first year in office, 1989.\n\n[6] National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation: The official presentation of a turkey to the President each year began in 1947 under President Harry Truman, and many sources erroneously attribute the origin of the turkey pardon to Truman. However, the Truman Library says that no documents, speeches, newspaper clippings, photographs or other contemporary records are known to exist that specify that he ever \"pardoned\" a turkey; there are records that Truman publicly admitted to eating at least some of them. The presentation was partially borne out of a lobbying campaign: the Truman Administration, in an effort to conserve grain for foreign aid campaigns, began promoting \"Meatless Tuesdays\" and \"Poultryless Thursdays\" in the autumn of 1947. Not only did American citizens quickly grow frustrated with the (voluntary, but strongly encouraged) restrictions and begin disregarding them in short order, the National Poultry and Egg Board, incensed at the attack on their industry, noted that not only was Thanksgiving on a Thursday (thus making the annual Thanksgiving turkey a taboo), but Christmas and New Year's Day also landed on a Thursday that year. A truce was called in the dispute in early November, before the Thanksgiving holiday, but \"Eggless Thursdays\" continued to be promoted for the rest of the year, meaning that pumpkin pie, another Thanksgiving staple, was still on the forbidden foods list.\n\n[7] Thanksgiving (United States): Since 1947, the National Turkey Federation has presented the President of the United States with one live turkey and two dressed turkeys, in a ceremony known as the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation. John F. Kennedy was the first president reported to spare the turkey given to him (he announced he didn't plan to eat the bird), and Ronald Reagan was the first to grant the turkey a presidential pardon, which he jokingly presented to his 1987 turkey (a turkey that would indeed be spared and sent to a petting zoo).\n\n[8] National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation: The early years also included a joint presentation with the Poultry and Egg National Board. The ceremony dates back to the 1940s, with presidents occasionally sparing the bird presented to them; since 1989, during George H. W. Bush's first Thanksgiving as president, it has been an annual tradition for the president to \"pardon\" the turkey. It's a tradition that the turkeys be picked from the chairman of the NTF's home state.\n\n[9] National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation: The phrase \"presidential pardon\" in that ceremony was apparently inserted by a speechwriter; Bush initially was indifferent to the terminology, saying Reprieve', 'keep him going', or 'pardon': it's all the same for the turkey, as long as he doesn't end up on the president's holiday table.\" Since then, at least one of the turkeys presented to the President has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life. For many years the turkeys were sent to Frying Pan Farm Park in Fairfax County, Virginia. From 2005 to 2009, the pardoned turkeys were sent to either the Disneyland Resort in California or the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, where they served as the honorary grand marshals of Disney's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, the turkeys were sent to live at Mount Vernon, the estate and home of George Washington; Mount Vernon stopped displaying and accepting the turkeys due to the fact that they violated the estate's policy of maintaining its own historical accuracy (Washington never farmed turkeys). The 2013, 2014 and 2015 turkeys were sent to Morven Park in Leesburg, Virginia, the estate of former Virginia governor (and prolific turkey farmer) Westmoreland Davis. Virginia Polytechnic Institute has housed the turkeys since 2016; Virginia Tech was chosen because of the college's poultry science program, and the National Turkey Federation wanted to begin a tradition of cooperation between the turkey industry and universities.\n\n[10] Thanksgiving (United States): George H. W. Bush, who served as vice president under Reagan, made the turkey pardon a permanent annual tradition upon assuming the presidency in 1989, a tradition that has been carried on by every president each year since. The pardoned turkeys have typically ended up in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C. From 1989 to 2004 they were sent to a children's farm called Frying Pan Farm Park in Herndon, Virginia. From 2009 to 2013 they were sent to George Washington's Mount Vernon estate near Alexandria, Virginia, and in 2014 they were sent to an estate in Leesburg, Virginia once owned by former state governor and turkey farmer Westmoreland Davis. However, from 2005 to 2009 they were sent to either Walt Disney World or Disneyland. The turkeys rarely live to see the next Thanksgiving due to being bred for large size.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

In addition, the two partly recognized frozen conflict zones of Artsakh and Transnistria are also landlocked.\n\n[2] Geography of Europe: Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, and Macedonia constitute a contiguous landlocked agglomeration of eight countries in Central Europe and the Balkans, stretching from Geneva all the way to Skopje. The other landlocked countries are \"standalone\" landlocked, not bordering any other such \"European\" one (the emphasis is necessary, since Kazakhstan borders Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, thus forming a vast landlocked expanse in Central Asia) \"Note\": Italy's capital, Rome, is the country's largest city if only the municipality (\"comune\") is considered. Greater Milan is the largest Metropolitan Area in Italy.\n\n[3] Landlocked country: There are the following \"single\" landlocked countries (each of them borders no other landlocked country):If the Caucasian countries and Kazakhstan are counted as part of Europe, then Europe has the most landlocked countries, at 20. If these transcontinental countries are included in Asia, then Africa has the most, at 16. Depending on the status of the three transcontinental countries, Asia has between 9 and 15, while South America has only 2. North America and Australia are the only continents with no landlocked countries (not including Antarctica, which has no countries).\n\n[4] Landlocked developing countries: Landlocked developing countries (LLDC) are developing countries that are landlocked. The economic and other disadvantages experienced by such countries makes the majority of landlocked countries least developed countries (LDC), with inhabitants of these countries occupying the bottom billion tier of the world's population in terms of poverty. Apart from Europe, there is not a single successful highly developed landlocked country as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI), and nine of the twelve countries with the lowest HDI scores are landlocked. Landlocked European countries are exceptions in terms of development outcomes due to their close integration with the regional European market. Landlocked countries that rely on transoceanic trade usually suffer a cost of trade that is double that of their maritime neighbours. Landlocked countries experience economic growth 6% less than their non-landlocked countries, holding other variables constant.\n\n[5] Landlocked country: Three countries are landlocked by a single country (enclaved countries):Seven landlocked countries are surrounded by only two mutually bordering neighbours (semi-enclaved countries):To this group could be added two \"de facto\" states with no or limited international recognition:A country is \"doubly landlocked\" or \"double-landlocked\" when it is surrounded entirely by one or more landlocked countries (requiring the crossing of at least two national borders to reach a coastline). There are two such countries:\n\n[6] Outline of Kazakhstan: The Republic of Kazakhstan is a landlocked sovereign country located across both Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Ranked as the ninth largest country in the world as well as the world's largest landlocked country, it has a territory of 2,727,300 km² (greater than Western Europe). It is bordered by Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and China. The country also borders on a significant part of the Caspian Sea.\n\n[7] Landlocked country: The economic disadvantages of being landlocked can be alleviated or aggravated depending on degree of development, language barriers, and other considerations. Some landlocked countries are quite affluent, such as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Austria, all of which frequently employ neutrality to their political advantage. The majority, however, are classified as Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs). Nine of the twelve countries with the lowest Human Development Indices (HDI) are landlocked.\n\n[8] Landlocked country: A landlocked state or landlocked country is a sovereign state entirely enclosed by land, or whose only coastlines lie on closed seas. There are currently 49 such countries, including five partially recognised states. Only two, Bolivia and Paraguay in South America, lie outside Afro-Eurasia (the Old World).\n\n[9] Landlocked developing countries: The United Nations has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly holds the view that high transport costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries. In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of direct access to the sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance. It also attributes geographic remoteness as one of the most significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries. One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, traffic delay due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts. Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between Uganda and Kenya makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in Mombasa, furthering delivery contract delays. Despite these explanations, it is also important to consider the transit countries that neighbour LLDCs, from whose ports the goods of LLDCs are exported.\n\n[10] Uzbekistan: Uzbekistan (, ; ; ), officially also the Republic of Uzbekistan (; ), is a landlocked country in Central Asia. The sovereign state is a secular, unitary constitutional republic, comprising 12 provinces, one autonomous republic, and a capital city. Uzbekistan is bordered by five landlocked countries: Kazakhstan to the north; Kyrgyzstan to the northeast; Tajikistan to the southeast; Afghanistan to the south; and Turkmenistan to the southwest. Along with Liechtenstein, it is one of the world's only two doubly landlocked countries (i.e. sharing borders only with other landlocked countries).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The endophyte has been identified as the cause of the \"fescue toxicosis\" syndrome sometimes suffered by livestock that graze the infected grass. Possible symptoms include poor weight gain, elevated body temperature, reduced conception rates, agalactia, rough hair coat, fat necrosis, loss of switch and ear tips, and lameness or dry gangrene of the feet. Because of the resemblance to symptoms of ergotism in humans, the most likely agents responsible for fescue toxicosis are thought to be the ergot alkaloids, principally ergovaline produced by \"E. coenophiala\".\n\n[2] Epichloë coenophiala: \"Epichloë coniophiala\" was originally described as an \"Acremonium\" species and later moved to the anamorphic form genus \"Neotyphodium\". Today, it is classified in \"Epichloë\". Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that \"E. coenophiala\" is an interspecific hybrid with three ancestors: \"E. festucae\", \"E. typhina\" and a third, undescribed or extinct species that also contributed a genome to the hybrid endophyte \"E. occultans\", among others.\n\n[3] Epichloë aotearoae: Epichloë aotearoae is a systemic and seed-transmissible symbiont of \"Echinopogon ovatus\", a grass endemic to Australia and New Zealand. It was originally described as a \"Neotyphodium\" species in 2002 but moved to \"Epichloë\" in 2014.\n\n[4] Eoophyla leroii: Eoophyla leroii is a moth in the family Crambidae. It was described by Embrik Strand in 1915. It is found in Botswana, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Uganda. The habitat consists of areas near rivers and swampy places.\n\n[5] Elophila ekthlipsis: Elophila ekthlipsis, the nymphula moth, is a moth in the family Crambidae. It was described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1876. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from the Great Lakes area, including Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Brunswick, New Hampshire, Ohio, Ontario, Quebec and Wisconsin. The habitat consists of ponds and marshes.\n\n[6] Xenolechia aethiops: Xenolechia aethiops is a moth of the family Gelechiidae. It is found from Ireland, Great Britain and Denmark to the Iberian Peninsula, Sardinia, Italy and Greece. It is also present in North Africa and Turkey and has also been reported from North America, with records from Alberta, Arizona, California, Maine, Saskatchewan and Texas.\n\n[7] Epichloë hybrida: \"Epichloë hybrida\" is a systemic, asexual and seed-transmissible endophyte of perennial ryegrass (\"Lolium perenne\" L.) within the genus \"Epichloë\". An interspecies hybrid of two haploid parent species \"Epichloë typhina\" and \"Epichloë festucae\" var. \"lolii\" (previously classified as \"Neotyphodium lolii\"), \"E. hybrida\" was first identified in 1989, recognized as an interspecific hybrid in 1994, but only formally named in 2017. Previously this species was often informally called \"Epichloë typhina\" x \"Epichloë festucae\" var. \"lolii\", or referenced by the identifier of its most well-studied strain, Lp1. \"Epichloë hybrida\" is a symbiont of perennial ryegrass where its presence is almost entirely asymptomatic. The species has been commercialized for the benefits of its anti-insect compounds in a pasture setting, although it is now more commonly used as an experimental model system for studying interspecific hybridization in fungi.\n\n[8] Eurylophella aestiva: Eurylophella aestiva is a species of spiny crawler mayfly in the family Ephemerellidae. It is found in southeastern Canada and the eastern United States.\n\n[9] Epichloë: Epichloë is a genus of ascomycete fungi forming an endophytic symbiosis with grasses. Grass choke disease is a symptom in grasses induced by some \"Epichloë\" species, which form spore-bearing mats (stromata) on tillers and suppress the development of their host plant's inflorescence. For most of their life cycle however, \"Epichloë\" grow in the intercellular space of stems, leaves, inflorescences, and seeds of the grass plant without incurring symptoms of disease. In fact, they provide several benefits to their host, including the production of different herbivore-deterring alkaloids, increased stress resistance, and growth promotion.\n\n[10] Heterophyes heterophyes: This species occurs in Egypt, Sudan, Israel, Brazil, Spain, Turkey, Iran, India, and Russia. Common in North Africa, Asia Minor, Korea, China, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. In Egypt, after looking at twelve populations of \"Cerithideopsilla conica\", which is mud snail and carrier of \"Heterophyes heterophyes\", it was found that the most infected snails were found in the Nile Delta compared to the Red sea coast and inland waters of the Delta. The transmission of \"Heterophyes heterophyes\" from, \"Pirenella conica\", a snail, to fish which live in Northern Africa in lagoons that are connected to the sea. For transmission to occur from snails to fish the snails had to be larger than 5 mm.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Construction on the plant began on 31 March 2002, but faced several delays due to opposition from local fishermen. KKNPP is scheduled to have six VVER-1000 reactors built in collaboration with Atomstroyexport, the Russian state company and Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), with an installed capacity of 6,000 MW of electricity.\n\n[2] Nuclear power in India: Russia has an ongoing agreement of 1988 vintage with India regarding establishing of two VVER 1000 MW reactors (water-cooled water-moderated light water power reactors) at Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu. A 2008 agreement caters for provision of an additional four third generation VVER-1200 reactors of capacity 1170 MW each. Russia has assisted in India’s efforts to design a nuclear plant for its nuclear submarine. In 2009, the Russians stated that Russia would not agree to curbs on export of sensitive technology to India. A new accord signed in Dec 2009 with Russia gives India freedom to proceed with the closed fuel cycle, which includes mining, preparation of the fuel for use in reactors, and reprocessing of spent fuel.\n\n[3] Kayamkulam: The Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Plant (also known as Rajiv Gandhi CCPP Kayamkulam or NTPC Kayamkulam) is a combined cycle power plant located at Kayamkulam, Alappuzha district, Kerala. The power plant is owned by NTPC Limited. The power plant is fueled by imported and indigenous naphtha. Source of the cooling water is Achankovil river. There is a plan to expand the plant by three units with capacity of 350 MW each. New units would be fueled by re-gasified liquefied natural gas.\n\n[4] Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant: Former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission of India Srinivasan said, \"The Fukushima plant was built on a beach-front, but the Kudankulam was constructed on a solid terrain and that too keeping all the safety aspects in mind. Also, we are not in a tsunami prone area. The plants in Kudankulam have a double containment system which can withstand high pressure. At least 14,000 crore has been spent. If we don't operate the plant immediately, it will affect the economic stability of our country\".\n\n[5] Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Plant: The Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Plant (also known as Rajiv Gandhi CCPP Kayamkulam or NTPC Kayamkulam) is a combined cycle power plant located at Choolatheruvu in Alappuzha district, Kerala, India. The power plant is owned by NTPC Limited. The power plant is fueled by imported and indigenous naphtha. Source of the cooling water is Achankovil river.\n\n[6] Political abuse of psychiatry: It was reported in June, 2012, that the Indian Government has approached NIMHANS, a well known mental health establishment in South India, to assist in suppressing anti-nuclear protests regards to building of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The government was in talks with NIMHANS representatives to chalk up a plan to dispatch psychiatrists to Kudankulam, for counselling protesters opposed to the building of the plant. To fulfill this, NIMHANS developed a team of 6 members, all of them, from the Department of Social Psychiatry. The psychiatrists were sent to get a \"peek into the protesters' minds\" and help them learn the importance of the plant according to one news source.\n\n[7] Rosatom: Rosatom owns 67% of the world nuclear plant construction market and, currently, the orders portfolio exceeded $133 billion. Rosatom has taken the lead in offering nuclear power plants to emerging countries. 37% of nuclear reactors under construction worldwide being built by Rosatom itself, usually the OKB Gidropress' VVER type. Rosatom received $66.5 billion of foreign orders in 2012, including $28.9 billion for nuclear plant construction, $24.7 billion for uranium products and $12.9 billion for nuclear fuel exports and associated activities. Nuclear power plants in China, India, and Iran, were either designed and built by Rosatom or with the corporation's participation. Rosatom is involved with the construction of the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant in China, the construction of Unit № 2 of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in India, and the construction of Unit № 1 of the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant in Belarus.\n\n[8] Nuclear power plant: Several countries have begun thorium-based nuclear power programs. Thorium is four times more abundant in the earth's crust than uranium. Over 60% of thorium's ore monazite is found in five countries: Australia, the United States, India, Brazil, and Norway. These thorium resources are enough to power current energy needs for thousands of years. The thorium fuel cycle is able to generate nuclear energy with a lower output of radiotoxic waste than the uranium fuel cycle.\n\n[9] Integrated gasification fuel cell cycle: Lower-temperature fuel cell types such as the proton exchange membrane fuel cell, phosphoric acid fuel cell, and alkaline fuel cell require pure hydrogen as fuel, typically produced from external reforming of natural gas. However, fuels cells operating at high temperature such as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) are not poisoned by carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and in fact can accept hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, and methane mixtures as fuel directly, because of their internal shift and reforming capabilities. This opens up the possibility of efficient fuel cell-based power cycles consuming solid fuels such as coal and biomass, the gasification of which results in syngas containing mostly hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane which can be cleaned and fed directly to the SOFCs without the added cost and complexity of methane reforming, water gas shifting and hydrogen separation operations which would otherwise be needed to isolate pure hydrogen as fuel. A power cycle based on gasification of solid fuel and SOFCs is called an Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell (IGFC) cycle; the IGFC power plant is analogous to an integrated gasification combined cycle power plant, but with the gas turbine power generation unit replaced with a fuel cell (high temperature type such as SOFC) power generation unit. By taking advantage of intrinsically high energy efficiency of SOFCs and process integration, exceptionally high power plant efficiencies are possible. Furthermore, SOFCs in the IGFC cycle can be operated so as to isolate a carbon dioxide-rich anodic exhaust stream, allowing efficient carbon capture to address greenhouse gas emissions concerns of coal-based power generation.\n\n[10] Combined cycle: An Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) is a hybrid technology in which a solar thermal field is integrated within a combined cycle plant. In ISCC plants, solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply, supporting the steam cycle, which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Terracotta is an ancient building material that translates from Latin as \"baked earth\". It can be unglazed, painted, slip glazed, or glazed. A piece of terracotta is composed of a hollow clay web enclosing a void space or cell. The cell can be installed in compression with mortar or hung with metal anchors. All cells are partially backfilled with mortar.\n\n[2] Italian Baptist Church: The Italian Baptist Church stands just off North Main Street, north of Barre's downtown business district. It is set on the north side of Brook Street, between North Main and Laurel Streets. It is a single-story structure, built with a wooden frame and masonry exterior. The side walls are brick, while the street-facing main facade is an elaborately decorated work of granite. A central recess is defined by a pair of polished Doric columns and flanked by square pilasters, all supporting a slightly projecting dentillated entablature. The entablature is continued to the main building corners, and is topped by a cornice and a central gabled parapet, at whose center is a Palladian window. The stonework of the facade exhibits a variety of finishes, from rusticated blocks on the lower level, to hammered details in the entablature, and the smoothly finished columns.\n\n[3] Gothic secular and domestic architecture: In Northern Germany, Netherlands, northern Poland, Denmark, and the Baltic countries local building stone was unavailable but there was a strong tradition of building in brick. The resultant style, Brick Gothic, is called \"Backsteingotik\" in Germany and Scandinavia and is associated with the Hanseatic League. In Italy, stone was used for fortifications, but brick was preferred for other buildings. Because of the extensive and varied deposits of marble, many buildings were faced in marble, or were left with undecorated façade so that this might be achieved at a later date.\n\n[4] Italian Community Bake Oven: Italian Community Bake Oven is a historic community bake oven located at Little Falls in Herkimer County, New York. It was built about 1891 and is abandoned. The utilitarian structure consists of a large rectangle of stone masonry outer walls enclosing the brick bake oven. The dimensions are approximately 16 feet wide, 20 feet deep, and 6 feet high. It was built to furnish large quantities of bread for Italian immigrant railroad workers in a work camp during 1891–1893.\n\n[5] Bakestone: In Wales, a bakestone, 'maen' in Welsh; 'gradell' in the north of the country, and 'planc', is the name for the cast iron or steel griddle used for cooking Welsh cakes, especially in South Wales. In Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire it was spelled and pronounced \"bakstone\" and used primarily to cook very thin yeasted oatcakes or earlier Riddlebread.\n\n[6] Balbo Monument: The Romans built the structure and column from breccia which is a type of stone created from the combination of angular gravel and the fragments of boulders. The pillar is a greenish color, thirteen feet tall and three feet in diameter. Two Italian architects named Capraro and Komar created the base of the monument out of travertine, which is a type of lightly colored limestone that is formed when river and spring waters evaporate. They inscribed a message in Italian from the Italian people of Fascist Italy. In English the message reads: The monument represents a portion of history but it is also valued as a piece of art and it stands as a symbol that has very different meanings for different groups of people.\n\n[7] Do it yourself: Italian archaeologists unearthed the ruins of a 6th-century BC Greek structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an \"ancient IKEA building\". The structure was a temple-like building discovered at Torre Satriano, near the southern city of Potenza, in Basilicata, a region where local people mingled with Greeks who settled along the southern coast known as Magna Graecia and in Sicily from the 8th century BC onwards. Professor Christopher Smith, director of the British School at Rome, said that the discovery was \"the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way\". Much like the instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the pieces slotted together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the Spartan colony of Taranto in Apulia.\n\n[8] Mortar (masonry): Historically, building with concrete and mortar next appeared in Greece. The excavation of the underground aqueduct of Megara revealed that a reservoir was coated with a pozzolanic mortar 12 mm thick. This aqueduct dates back to c. 500 BCE. Pozzolanic mortar is a lime based mortar, but is made with an additive of volcanic ash that allows it to be hardened underwater; thus it is known as hydraulic cement. The Greeks obtained the volcanic ash from the Greek islands Thira and Nisiros, or from the then Greek colony of Dicaearchia (Pozzuoli) near Naples, Italy. The Romans later improved the use and methods of making what became known as pozzolanic mortar and cement. Even later, the Romans used a mortar without pozzolana using crushed  terra cotta, introducing aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide into the mix. This mortar was not as strong as pozzolanic mortar, but, because it was denser, it better resisted penetration by water.\n\n[9] Saint James' the Elder church (Štvrtok na Ostrove): The prevailing building material used for the original construction in the mid-13th century building boom were bricks. The majority of the romanesque churches in this region of Slovakia is from this period. The two-tower design though makes this church unique on the Žitný ostrov. The only similar one is the church of the Benedictine Abbey of Diakovce. The original face of the church is unknown. It was a single-nave building with a two-tower facade. What the sanctuary once looked like is not known. It is probable that it had the form of an apse with a semi-circular ending, like in the neighboring villages of Mierovo and Alžbetin Dvor, or with a straight end, like in the neighboring village of Hubice. The church is not a classic brick building because the foundations and the lower part of the towers along with other architectural details are made of stone. The existing polygonal presbytery replaced the apse in the 14th century. An earthquake with the epicentre in Komárno struck the church in 1590. The impaired structure caused the northern tower to collapse. It was rebuilt and simultaneously the original single-nave space was arched with two supporting pillars which changed it into a two-naved space. The northern nave was built out and a two-storey building with a square ground plan was added to the southern tower. The medieval character of the church was enhanced during its renovation in the 1960s and 1970s when the neo-gothic southern entrance hall was removed and the first floor of the southern tower received a pair of composite windows.\n\n[10] George Mathers (architect): Taking Stock describes the church as being based on a pentagram: \"The building is externally clad in loadbearing brick laid in English garden wall bond (five courses of stretchers to each course of headers), surmounted by a reinforced concrete ring beam and a steel framed main roof covered with Cornish slates. The form of the roof calls to mind medieval precedent, e.g. the Abbot’s kitchen at Glastonbury. It is surmounted by an aluminium spirelet and cross and lit by dormer windows, considered by The Buildings of England to be ‘unfortunately spiky’.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Although some Hindu dharmic texts contain injunctions against homosexuality, a number of Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful. However,Hinduism has maintained the sanctity of marriage being between a man and a woman and considers it to be one of the main duties of a Hindu householder.There are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women engaging in homosexual acts. Same-sex relations and gender variance have been represented within Hinduism from Vedic times through to the present day, in rituals, law books, religious or so-called mythical narratives, commentaries, paintings, and sculpture. The extent to which these representations embrace or reject homosexuality has been disputed within the religion as well as outside of it. In 2009, The United Kingdom Hindu Council issued a statement that 'Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality', subsequent to the decision of the Delhi High Court to legalise homosexuality in India. The Supreme Court of India subsequently overturned the capital high court's decision. A high-ranking member of the influential right-wing Hindu group RSS has publicly stated that he does not believe homosexuality should be illegal, and that the RSS had no official stance on this issue since it was a matter of personal preference. After Supreme Court of India struck down parts of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, RSS stated that while relationships between people of same gender was unnatural, it was not a criminal act.\n\n[2] Hinduism and LGBT topics: Hindus have many sacred texts and different communities give special importance to different texts. Even more so than in other religions, Hindus also foster disparate interpretations of the meaning of various texts. The Vedas, which form the foundation of Hinduism for many, do not refer explicitly to homosexuality, but Rigveda says regarding Samsara that Vikruti Evam Prakriti (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes the cyclical constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. People of a third gender (\"tritiya-prakriti\"), not fully men nor women, are mentioned here and there throughout Hindu texts such as the Puranas but are not specifically defined. In general they are portrayed as effeminate men, often cowardly, and with no desire for women. Modern readers often draw parallels between these and modern stereotypes of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexual identities. However, Hindu texts (Mostly Dharmasastras) such as the Manusmirti, Vide Atri Smřti , Vide Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra and the Vide Apastambha Dharmasūtra do treat Homosexuality as a sin, in some cases legally punishable. in addition, each hindu denomination had developed distinct rules regarding sexuality, as hinduism is not unifyed and is decentralized in essence.\n\n[3] Homosexuality and religion: Hinduism has taken various positions, ranging from positive to neutral or antagonistic. Referring to the nature of Samsara, the Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems unnatural is also natural). A \"third gender\" has been acknowledged within Hinduism since Vedic times. Several Hindu texts, such as Manu Smriti and Sushruta Samhita, assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology. However, Hindu texts like the [Manusmirti do treat Homosexuality as a sin legally punishable. in addition, each hindu denomination had developed distinct rules regarding sexuality, as hinduism is not unifyed and is decentralized in essence.\n\n[4] Hinduism and LGBT topics: Although some Hindu dharmic texts contain injunctions against homosexuality, a number of Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful.

Homosexuality is against Indian culture, against nature and against science. We are regressing, going back to when we were almost like animals. The SC had protected our culture.\" Singhal further dismissed HIV/AIDS concerns within the LGBT community saying, \"It is understood that when you try to suppress one anomaly, there will be a break-out of a few more.\" This, however, is in stark disagreement with many Hindu teachings because Hinduism does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.\n\n[6] Religion and LGBT people: Hinduism has taken various positions, ranging from positive to neutral or antagonistic. Referring to the nature of Samsara, the Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says 'Vikruti Evam Prakriti' (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes homosexuality as natural, if not an approval of homosexuality. Sexuality is rarely discussed openly in Hindu society, and LGBT issues are largely a taboo subject — especially among the strongly religious. A \"third gender\" has been acknowledged within Hinduism since Vedic times. Several Hindu texts, such as Manu Smriti and Sushruta Samhita, assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology. They worked as hairdressers, flower-sellers, servants, masseurs and prostitutes. Today, many people of a \"third gender\" (hijras) live throughout India, mostly on the margins of society, and many still work in prostitution, or make a livelihood as beggars.\n\n[7] Societal attitudes toward homosexuality: Among Indic religions (also known as Dharmic religions), including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear. Unlike in western religions, homosexuality is rarely discussed. However, most contemporary religious authorities in the various Dharmic traditions view homosexuality negatively, and when it is discussed, it is discouraged or actively forbidden. Ancient religious texts such as the Vedas often refer to people of a third gender, who are neither female nor male. Some see this third gender as an ancient parallel to modern western lesbian, gay, transgender and intersex identities. However, this third sex is usually negatively valued as a pariah class in ancient texts. Ancient Hindu law books, from the first century onward, categorize non-vaginal sex (\"ayoni\") as impure. Same-sex sexuality and gender transformations are common among the Hindu pantheon of deities.\n\n[8] LGBT rights in India: The Khajuraho temples, famous for their erotic sculptures, contain several depictions of homosexual activity. Historians have long argued that pre-colonial Indian society did not criminalise same-sex relationships, nor did it view such relations as immoral or sinful. Hinduism, India's largest religion, has traditionally portrayed homosexuality as natural and joyful, though some Hindu texts do contain injunctions against homosexuality namely among priests. Hinduism also acknowledges a third gender known as \"hijra\". There are multiple characters in the Mahabharata who change genders, such as Shikhandi who is born female but identifies as male and eventually marries a woman. Bahuchara Mata is the goddess of fertility, worshipped by \"hijras\" as their patroness. The Nāradasmṛti and the Sushruta Samhita, two important scriptures from ancient India relating to dharma and medicine, respectively, declare homosexuality to be \"incurable\" and forbid homosexuals from marrying a partner of the opposite sex. The Nāradasmṛti lists fourteen types of \"panda\" (men who are impotent with women); among these are the \"mukhebhaga\" (men who have oral sex with other men), the \"sevyaka\" (men who are sexually enjoyed by other men) and the \"irshyaka\" (the voyeur who watches other men engaging in sex). The Kama Sutra, a Sanskrit text on human sexual behaviour, uses the term \"tritiya-prakriti\" to define men with homosexual desires and describes their practices in great detail. Likewise, the Kama Sutra describes lesbians (\"svairini\", who engage in aggressive lovemaking with other women), bisexuals (referred to as \"kami\" or \"paksha\"), transgender and intersex people. The Sushruta Sam\n\n[9] Sexual minorities in Sri Lanka: Hinduism is mostly devoid of the 'perfect law' that can be found in Abrahamic religions (such as the ten commandments) and traditionally Hindus would expect to \"rely on reason to decide what is dharma and what  is not\" 'dharma'. Combined with the lack of centralization and authority, there is great diversity among Hindus as to how homosexual relationships should be institutionalized in Hindu society.\n\n[10] Hinduism and LGBT topics: Commenting on the legalisation of homosexuality in India; Anil Bhanot, general secretary of The United Kingdom Hindu Council said: \"The point here is that the homosexual nature is part of the natural law of God; it should be accepted for what it is, no more and no less. Hindus are generally conservative but it seems to me that in ancient India, they even celebrated sex as an enjoyable part of procreation, where priests were invited for ceremonies in their home to mark the beginning of the process\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The prevalence of this disease is infrequent and often goes unreported, especially in cases resulting from drug abuse. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a popular method to study and diagnose the disease. However, even with technological advances, the exact mechanism and underlying pathophysiology of toxic leukoencephalopathy remains unknown and is thought to vary between sources of toxicity. The clinical severity of toxic leukoencephalopathy also varies among patients, exposure time, and concentration and purity of the toxic agent. Some reversibility of the condition has been seen in many cases when the toxic agent is removed.\n\n[2] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: Young acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with methotrexate-induced leukoencephalopathy appear asymptomatic. However, toxic leukoencephalopathy induced by drug abuse or environmental toxins have had more damaging side effects. Heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy has had three stages described. The first stage features soft (pseudobulbar) speech, cerebellar ataxia, motor restlessness, and apathy/bradyphrenia. The intermediate stage includes pyramidal tract and pseudobulbar signs, spastic paresis, myoclonic jerks, and choreoathetoid movements. The final or terminal stage is characterized by stretching spasms, akinetic mutism, hypotonic paresis, central pyrexia, and death. Similarly, leukoencephalopathy induced by orally administered methotrexate for arthritis patients presents similar symptoms including ataxia, dysarthria, and seizures; however, long-term cognitive effects remain unknown. Symptoms of leukoencephalopathy caused by overdose of metronidazole medication include dysarthria, gait disturbance, weakness of extremities, and mental confusion. Despite the pharmacological agent or source of toxicity, some patients completely recover from toxic leukoencephalopathy. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) can also result from medication toxicity. Symptoms similar to those of leukoencephalopathy patients have been seen in PRES patients. However, the prognosis of toxic leukoencephalopathy is typically slightly worse than that PRES because toxic leukoencephalopathy is more likely to lead to ataxia, dementia, or coma.\n\n[3] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: Due to advances in MRI, this neurological disorder has been characterized more successfully in more recent years. MRI can aid in the detection of injured brain tissue; however, the severity and extent of the damage demonstrated by imaging does not always reflect patient clinical status. Toxic leukoencephalopathy encompasses the degeneration of white matter tracts devoted to higher cerebral function; however, white matter can appear normal until the disease has progressed more intensely. Toxic leukoencephalopathy-related damage to central nervous system (CNS) white matter, typically of the periventricular nucleus, and other structures in the brain is often bilateral and symmetric. Heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy often involves damage to cerebellar white matter, posterior cerebral white matter, posterior limb of internal capsule, and cerebellar peduncles. The occipital lobe is typically most affected though the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes have shown involvement as well. Other toxins have been shown to extend damage to other structures of the brain, including the hippocampus, dorsal medulla, and brainstem.\n\n[4] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: It is believed by some researchers that heroin-induced leukoencephalopathy may be caused by a contaminant, or “cutting agent,” in the heroin. However, no such agent has been identified; and indeed, toxic leukoencephalopathy has been observed as a result of intoxication with contaminant-free opiates. Cases include a 65-year-old woman who had mistakenly been taking three times the dose of methadone that had been prescribed for pain management, and a young girl intoxicated with pure morphine sulphate tablets.\n\n[5] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: Leukoencephalopathy may result from the inhalation, intravenous injection, or ingestion of substance abuse drugs. However, such occurrences are rare, sporadic, and often go undocumented. Leukoencephalopathy caused by inhalation of heroin, also known as \"chasing the dragon\" syndrome, is one of the most studied of these rare occurrences and has even been recognized for over twenty five years.\n\n[6] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: Various chemotherapy drugs have shown increased risk of cancer patients developing leukoencephalopathy. High doses of intravenous methotrexate, or intrathecal (injection into the spinal fluid) methotrexate are both necessary components of chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, these are known to cause asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy in children and young adults. Methotrexate-related leukoencephalopathy prevalence has been reported to decline with time and dosage. Other chemotherapeutic agents that have induced neurotoxicity include 5-fluorouracil and fludarabine.\n\n[7] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: Various pharmacological agents have been known to cause toxic leukoencephalopathy. The most common causes are substance abuse drugs and chemotherapy; however, the disease has also occurred on the rare occasion as a side effect to certain medications and environmental toxins.\n\n[8] Toxic leukoencephalopathy: Symptoms vary widely between sources of toxicity, dosage, length of time patient was exposed to the toxic substance, patient history, and patient genetics. Especially in the case of leukoencephalopathy developing due to substance abuse or environmental toxins, symptoms typically do not develop until several days to months after exposure to the pharmacological agent. Clinical features range from inattention, forgetfulness, and changes in personality to dementia, coma, and even death. Obvious signs of the condition are difficulty with cognitive function and equilibrioception. Common initial symptoms include confusion, somnolence, generalized seizures, headaches, and vision impairment.\n\n[9] Leukoencephalopathy: The acquired demyelinating disorders are classified according to their underlying causes into five groups: noninfectious–inflammatory, infectious–inflammatory, toxic–metabolic, hypoxic–ischemic (vascular problems like Binswanger's disease), and traumatic.\n\n[10] Leukoencephalopathy: Leukoencephalopathy (leukodystrophy-like diseases) is all of the brain white matter diseases, whether their molecular cause is known or not. It can refer specifically to any of these diseases:The classification of leukoencephalopathies is a matter of debate. Some authors divide leukoencephalopathies into hereditary disorders and acquired disorders. The hereditary demyelinating disorders are then classified according to the localization of the underlying metabolic defect, and they include the leukodystrophies when myelin growth is the underlying problem.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is the rate a bank or other lender charges to borrow its money, or the rate a bank pays its savers for keeping money in an account.\n\n[2] Shared appreciation mortgage: The lender of a Shared Appreciation Mortgage lent a sum of money up to a maximum of 25% of the value of the property. The borrower retained ownership of the property and no repayments were made until the property was sold or the borrower died. At that time the repayment was the original amount borrowed plus a share of the increase in the value of the property. The lender's percentage share was three times the percentage of the value of the property that was originally borrowed. Therefore if the original loan was 25% of the value of the property, the share of the increase in the value would have been 75%. For the purpose of this calculation, the final value of the property was not the price at which the property was sold, but a valuation commissioned by the lender and paid for by the borrower. So if the property was sold for less than the valuation, the borrower's percentage share would be further reduced.\n\n[3] Natural borrowing limit: However banks will not lend infinite amount money unless they are philanthropists. They will only lend reasonable amount money so that they could receive back from the students without too much risk. If banks are willing to lend $6,000,000 to the student, then, it is said that students face the natural borrowing limit, because they are allowed to borrow exactly up to the amount which they earn for their lifetime. If students are only allowed to borrow less than $6,000,000, then it is said that they face a borrowing limit tighter than the natural borrowing limit. One caveat is that the concept natural borrowing limit does not depend on what amount of money that law students borrow. In this example, they will not borrow more than $200,000, but, as long as they are \"allowed\" to borrow $6,000,000, then it is enough to say students are in the natural borrowing limit world.\n\n[4] Mortgage broker: In the event that the loan is paid back by the borrower within 24 months of the loan settlement, mortgage brokers are charged a \"clawback\" fee by the lenders since the loan is considered \"unprofitable\". The amount is usually 0.66% of the loan amount for loans paid back in the first 12 months and 0.33% for loans paid back in the next 12 months. When this happens the mortgage brokers are sometimes able to charge the customer the amount if they hold written authority to do this. Mortgage brokers don't like to be liable for the fee, but in some case it is unrecoverable. Keep in mind that a standard home loan in Australia is contracted over a 30-year term, with the average loan life being approximately 4–5 years.\n\n[5] Harmoney: Investors earn money from interest and receive repayments from borrowers as they are made, proportionate to the percentage of the loan total they funded. Harmoney makes money by charging a platform fee to borrowers and a service fee to investors. The platform fee amount varies from 2% to 6% depending on the borrower's credit grade, while the service fee is 1.25% on all amounts the borrower pays.. Borrowers pay either $200 or $450 if their loan is successfully funded.\n\n[6] Returns (economics): \"Whoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it either from his labor, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue derived from labor is called wages. That derived from stock, by the person who manages or employs it, is called profit. That derived from it by the person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is called the interest (f)or the use of money (or stock). It is the compensation which the borrower pays to the lender, for the profit which he has an opportunity of making by the use of the money (or stock). Part of that profit naturally belongs to the borrower, who runs the risk and takes the trouble of employing it; and part to the lender, who affords him the opportunity of making this profit. The interest of money is always a derivative revenue, which, if it is not paid from the profit which is made by the use of the money, must be paid from some other source of revenue, unless perhaps the borrower is a spendthrift, who contracts a second debt in order to pay the interest of the first.\" (Smith)\n\n[7] Credit card interest: Credit card interest is the principal way in which credit card issuers generate revenue. A card issuer is a bank or credit union that gives a consumer (the cardholder) a card or account number that can be used with various payees to make payments and borrow money from the bank simultaneously. The bank pays the payee and then charges the cardholder interest over the time the money remains borrowed. Banks suffer losses when cardholders do not pay back the borrowed money as agreed. As a result, optimal calculation of interest based on any information they have about the cardholder's credit risk is key to a card issuer's profitability. Before determining what interest rate to offer, banks typically check national, and international (if applicable), credit bureau reports to identify the borrowing history of the card holder applicant with other banks and conduct detailed interviews and documentation of the applicant's finances.\n\n[8] MicroFinance Institutions Network: Validation of lending money beyond the clients (borrower) capability to pay back was a challenge to RBI before. MFIN tries to validate this aspect by finding the existing borrowings of the client through dedicated microfinance credit bureaus, only two MFIs can lend to one borrower and both together cannot provide loans beyond Rs.100,000.\n\n[9] Proebsting's paradox: For example, given the original example of a 2 to 1 payout followed by a 5 to 1 payout, in this formulation the bettor first bets 25% of wealth at 2 to 1. When the 5 to 1 payout is offered, the bettor can sell back the original bet for a loss of 0.125. His 2 to 1 bet pays 0.5 if he wins and costs 0.25 if he loses. At the new 5 to 1 payout, he could get a bet that pays 0.625 if he wins and costs 0.125 if he loses, this is 0.125 better than his original bet in both states. Therefore his original bet now has a value of -0.125. Given his new wealth level of 0.875, his 40% bet (the Kelly amount for the 5 to 1 payout) is 0.35.\n\n[10] Private money investing: Mortgage Funds: Yields virtually always fall within a narrow band 4% to 6% above money market returns.

The service is held every 25 December early on Christmas morning; at 7 a.m. in most church buldings, but in some churches it is celebrated at 10 a.m., or as early as 4 a.m. During previous centuries, most Julottas were held at 4 a.m. Traditionally, the service should end before, or at the time of, dawn: hence the word \"otta\" is the time just before dawn. Historically in the Church of Sweden the clergy was obliged not only to say the high mass but also matins () and evensong (); today only the evensong of Christmas remain but has been liturgically changed since and can now be the main service of Christmas Day, wherefore many parishes have no mid-morning high mass on Christmas Day.\n\n[2] Julotta: Swedish immigrants spread the festivity to different countries. The earliest recorded history of Julotta service in the United States of America was held in Strombeck Church in Minnesota in 1883. After Julotta, Swedish people race to get home first from the church. The winner is believed to harvest the most bountiful crops for the year ahead.\n\n[3] Etymology of Jämtland: The etymology of Jämtland entails the origin, history, and use of the name Jämtland which dates back to 11th century Scandinavia. The name is first found on the northernmost runestone in Europe, the \"Frösö Runestone\", as \"eotalont\" (in normalized Old Norse: \"Jamtaland\"). The prefix Jamta is a genitive plural case of Jamts, a Germanic tribe. The root of Jamt (Old West Norse: \"jamti\"), and thus Jämtland, derives from the Proto-Germanic word stem \"emat-\" meaning persistent, efficient, enduring and hardworking. So Jämtland basically mean \"Jamts' land\" or \"land of hardworking people\".\n\n[4] Holt (surname): The word is also found in Scandinavian placenames and in surnames derived from them: in Danish, Norwegian, and Icelandic as \"Holt\" (or the more archaic Danish \"Holdt\" and \"Holte\"); in Swedish as \"Hult\" or \"Hulte\"; and even in Finnish as \"Hulti\" (a loanword from Swedish). It is often used in combination with other words, as in \"Uhrenholdt\" (\"ancient holt\", a Danish last name taken from that of an estate) or Älghult (\"elk holt\"), a village and the site of a small art-glass factory in Småland, Sweden. In Sweden it is most commonly found in and around Småland, including Älmhult, the location of the first IKEA store.\n\n[5] Julussa: Julussa is a river in Hedmark, Norway, starting at Bergesjøen 1043 feet (318 m.o.h.) The name Julussa comes from the old Norwegian word \"ljudlausa\" which means soundless. The reason for that given name is that the river flows so silently through the valley of Julussdalen. Julussa was very important for timber rafting the timber out of the big forests, from around the mid 16th century until 1969. From Bergesjøen, Julussa flows 32 kilometers until it flows into Renaelva. The place Brattveltdammen along the Julussa is known as a national historic place for the Julussakonflikten in 1927.\n\n[6] Swedish profanity: One particular compounding construction takes the profanity as the head of the compound and the referent as the modifier: thus \"hundjävel\" means approximately \"bloody dog\", but the head of the compound is \"jävel\", and \"hund\" \"dog\" is the modifier. This is often pleonastically modified with \"jävla\", as \"jävla hundjävel\" \"fucking bloody dog\". Alternatively, this can be analyzed as a derivation with \"-jävel\" as a suffix. The formation is extremely productive and basically any concrete noun can be suffixed with \"-jävel\", e.g. \"lådjävel\" \"bloody box\", \"kyrkjävel\" \"bloody church\" (note that the combining form for \"kyrka\" \"church\" is here \"kyrk-\" rather than traditional \"kyrko-\"). Other comparable morphemes that are more or less productive are \"-helvete\" (often abstract nouns), \"-äckel\" (for people; \"äckel\" means \"disgust\" or \"disgusting person\", cf. \"äcklig\" \"disgusting\"), \"-fan\" (often animals, as in \"älgfan\" \"bloody moose\"), \"-fitta\" (for women), \"-mongo\".\n\n[7] Jamtli: Jamtli is the name of the regional museum of Jämtland and Härjedalen in Östersund, Sweden. It consists of an open-air museum with historical buildings, and an indoor museum with both permanent and temporary exhibitions. “Jamtli” literally means “hillside of Jämtland” in the local dialect. Since the 1980s, the museum has been working with living history in a project entitled \"Jamtli Historyland\". This venture has contributed to make the museum one of the most popular tourist attractions in the region.\n\n[8] Santa Lucia: In Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Norway, \"Santa Lucia\" has been given various lyrics to accommodate it to the winter-light Saint Lucy's Day, at the darkest time of the year. The three most famous lyrics versions in Swedish are \"Luciasången\", also known by its incipit, \"Sankta Lucia, ljusklara hägring\" (\"Saint Lucy, bright illusion\"); \"Natten går tunga fjät\" (\"The night walks with heavy steps\"); and the 1970s \"kindergarten\" version, \"Ute är mörkt och kallt\" (\"Outside it’s dark and cold\"). The more common Norwegian version is \"Svart senker natten seg\" (\"Black the night descends\").\n\n[9] Jämtland: Jämtland's name derives from its inhabitants, the Jamts. The name can be traced back to Europe's northernmost runestone, the Frösö Runestone from the 11th century, where it is found as \"eotalont\" (normalized Old Norse: \"Jamtaland\"). The root of Jamt (Old West Norse: \"jamti\"), and thus Jämtland, derives from the Proto-Germanic word stem \"emat-\" meaning persistent, efficient, enduring and hardworking. The Proto-Norse prefix \"eota\" (\"jamta\") is a genitive plural case.\n\n[10] Haltija: Human settlements also have haltijas. One type is the tonttu or maan haltija (land haltija). The tonttu is the Finnish version of the Swedish tomte. The Finnish tonttu and the Swedish tomte are related to the words \"tontti\" (Finnish) and \"tomt\" (Swedish), which both mean building lot and building site. (Later, such local spirits are also referred to as a \"tomtegubbe\" [\"old man of the homestead\"] in Swedish). The kotihaltija (home elf, home gnome) is the tonttu who lives in every home. He takes care of the house, and it is important to treat him with respect. The saunatonttu lives in the sauna and protects it but also makes sure that people do not behave improperly in it. \"Joulutonttu\" is Finnish for Christmas elf. Unlike the Christmas elves in some countries, the Finnish joulutonttu doesn't have pointy ears.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Greene Jr.: Greene's parents – Alvin Carl Greene Sr. (born in Wills Point, Texas, in 1902), and Johnnie Marie Cole (born in Beaumont, Teas, in 1906) – were killed in 1964 in a two-vehicle accident while traveling from Beaumont to Dallas (after visiting their son David Greene and his new wife, Mary Welch, in New Orleans). Their car had been hit by an 18-wheel truck doing 80 mph on U.S. 69, five miles south of Rusk, Texas. Greene was at the time. His only living sibling, David Michael Greene (1939-2015) of New York, New York, was . A. C. and David had a brother John Lytle, but he had died months of age in 1935. A. C.'s four children ranged from to .\n\n[2] Ray Greene (politician): Greene's grandfather was colonial governor William Greene Sr., and both his father and mother, who were second cousins, descend from early colonial deputy governor John Greene Jr. Ray Greene also descends from several early Rhode Island settlers, including Warwick founders John Greene Sr., Samuel Gorton, and Randall Holden, and Providence founder Roger Williams.\n\n[3] John Greene Jr.: John Greene Jr. (1620 – 27 November 1708) was a deputy governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations who spent almost his entire adult life in the public service of the colony. Born in England, he was the son of John Greene Sr. and Joan Tattersall, and sailed to New England with his parents in 1635 aboard the ship \"James\". His father, after coming from Massachusetts to Providence, became one of the original settlers of Warwick. In 1652 Greene served in his first public role as a commissioner from Warwick, and served in some public capacity every year until 1690 when he was first chosen as deputy governor of the colony. He then served 10 consecutive one-year terms in this capacity, retiring from public service in 1700 at the age of 80. He was one of the 10 Assistants named in the Royal Charter of 1663, which would become the basis for Rhode Island's government for nearly two centuries. During the devastating events of King Phillips War, Greene was one of 16 prominent inhabitants of the colony whose counsel was sought by the General Assembly.\n\n[4] William Greene (governor): William Greene Jr. (August 16, 1731November 29, 1809) was the second governor of the state of Rhode Island, serving in this capacity for eight years, five of which were during the American Revolutionary War. From a prominent Rhode Island family, his father, William Greene Sr., had served 11 terms as a colonial governor of Rhode Island. His great-grandfather, John Greene Jr. served for ten years as deputy governor of the colony, and his great-great-grandfather, John Greene Sr. was a founding settler of both Providence and Warwick.\n\n[5] William Greene (lieutenant governor): From a prominent Rhode Island family, Greene was the son of United States Senator and Rhode Island Attorney General Ray Greene and his wife Mary M. Flagg. Greene was also the grandson of the second governor of the state, William Greene, Jr. who served for several years during the American Revolutionary War, and the great grandson of William Greene, Sr. who served 11 one-year terms as a colonial governor of Rhode Island. Greene also descends from John Greene, Jr. who served for ten years as deputy governor of the Rhode Island colony, from Warwick founders John Greene, Sr., Samuel Gorton, and Randall Holden, and from Frances (Latham) Dungan, the \"mother of governors.\"\n\n[6] Mary Ann Greene: Mary Anne Greene was born in Warwick, Rhode Island, June 14, 1857, the daughter of John Waterman Aborn Greene and Mary Frances (Low) Greene. She was a lineal descendant of Roger Williams, and was of the ninth generation of the Rhode Island family founded by Dr. John Greene, son of Richard Greene, of Bowridge Hill, Gillingham, Dorset, England. John Greene came to Salem, Massachusetts from Salisbury, England, 1635, was one of the original proprietors of Providence, Rhode Island, 1636, and one of the original purchasers and founders of the town of Warwick, in 1642. This family gave to the colony and State a number of public officials, among them a Deputy Governor, John Greene, Jr.; a Chief Justice, who sat on the bench of the Court of Common Pleas of Kent County, Rhode Island all through the American Revolution; Philip Greene, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island; two colonial Governors, William and William, Jr.; and two Revolutionary officers of distinction, General Nathanael Greene and Colonel Christopher Greene, associated with the Battle of Red Bank, was a cousin of General Nathanael Greene.\n\n[7] William Greene (colonial governor): William Greene was the son of Samuel Greene (1671-1720) and Mary Gorton Greene (1673-1732), and grandson of John Greene Jr. of Warwick, who had spent most of his long life as a public servant, including 10 years as the Deputy Governor of the colony. His great-grandfather, also named John Greene Sr., had come from Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, was a surgeon, and an early settler of Warwick in the colony of Rhode Island. His great-grandfather on his mother's side was Samuel Gorton, the founder of Warwick, and for a very short period the governor of the two towns of Providence and Warwick.\n\n[8] John Greene Jr.: Greene died in Warwick on 27 November 1708 and was buried on the Spring Greene Farm (later the property of Governor Theodore F. Green) in Warwick. Greene married Ann Almy, the daughter of William and Audry (Barlow) Almy. They had 11 children, the youngest of whom, Samuel, married Mary Gorton, a granddaughter of Rhode Island colonial president Samuel Gorton. Their grandson, William Greene Sr. served for 11 one-year terms as a governor of the colony, and their great-grandson, also named William Greene Jr. was a governor of the State of Rhode Island. John and Ann Greene are also ancestors of United States President Warren G. Harding, as well as inventor Thomas A. Edison, Canadian politician and religious leader Nathan Eldon Tanner, cowboy artist and inventor Earl W. Bascom and Hollywood actor John Wayne.\n\n[9] Graham Greene: His parents, Charles Henry Greene and Marion Raymond Greene, were first cousins, both members of a large, influential family that included the owners of Greene King Brewery, bankers, and statesmen; his mother was cousin to Robert Louis Stevenson. Charles Greene was second master at Berkhamsted School, where the headmaster was Dr Thomas Fry, who was married to Charles' cousin. Another cousin was the right-wing pacifist Ben Greene, whose politics led to his internment during World War II.\n\n[10] Stanley Greene: Greene was born to middle class parents in Brooklyn. Both his parents were actors. His father, who was born in Harlem, was a union organizer, one of the first African Americans elected as an officer in the Screen Actors Guild, and belonged to the Harlem Renaissance movement. Greene's father was blacklisted as a Communist in the 1950s and forced to take uncredited parts in movies. Greene's parents gave him his first camera when he was eleven years old.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The aircraft was designed by the Mikoyan design bureau as a replacement for the earlier MiG-25 \"Foxbat\"; the MiG-31 is based on and shares design elements with the MiG-25. The MiG-31 has the distinction of being one of the fastest combat jets in the world. It continues to be operated by the Russian Air Force and the Kazakhstan Air Force following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Russian Defence Ministry expects the MiG-31 to remain in service until at least 2030.\n\n[2] Mikoyan MiG-41: The Mikoyan MiG-41 or PAK DP (, ) is an interceptor aircraft under development by Mikoyan. The aircraft is intended to replace the Mikoyan MiG-31 in the Russian Air Force in mid-2020s. According to the Russian defense analyst Vasily Kashin, the MiG-41 would be considered as a 5++ or 6th generation project.\n\n[3] Mikoyan MiG-31: Russia plans to start development of a replacement for the MiG-31 by 2019. The aircraft will be called PAK-DP (ПАК ДП, \"Перспективный авиационный комплекс дальнего перехвата\" – Prospective Air Complex for Long-Range Interception). Development of the new aircraft, designated MiG-41, began in April 2013. Such development is favored over restarting MiG-31 production. In March 2014, Russian test pilot Anatoly Kvochur said that work began on a Mach 4 capable MiG-41 based on the MiG-31. Later reports said that development of the MiG-31 replacement is to begin in 2017, with the first aircraft to be delivered in 2020, and the replacement entering service in 2025.\n\n[4] Mikoyan MiG-27: The Mikoyan MiG-27 (; NATO reporting name: Flogger-D/J) is a variable-geometry ground-attack aircraft, originally built by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet Union and later licence-produced in India by Hindustan Aeronautics as the Bahadur (\"Valiant\"). It is based on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter aircraft, but optimized for air-to-ground attack. Unlike the MiG-23, the MiG-27 did not see widespread use outside Russia, as most countries opted for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23BN and Sukhoi Su-22 instead. It remains in service with the Indian, Kazakh and Sri Lankan Air Forces in the ground attack role. All Russian and Ukrainian MiG-27s have been retired.\n\n[5] Mikoyan MiG-33: The designation MiG-33 has been associated with two different Mikoyan fighter designs. It was first employed for a single-engine, lightweight strike fighter similar in capabilities to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. More formally known as \"\"Project 33\"\", development work began on this design about 1980, but was cancelled in 1986 as the result of changing Soviet Air Forces requirements. However, in 1998 China purchased the design and test data from Russia to aid in expediting the development of the CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder. More recently, the \"MiG-33\" designation was introduced at the 1994 Farnborough Airshow as the briefly used marketing name for the \"MiG-29ME\" export model of the MiG-29M Fulcrum-E, a comprehensively upgraded, fully multirole version of the MiG-29. Although only a few MiG-29M aircraft were built (and none exported), they have served as prototypes for the development of the latest, most advanced Fulcrum variant, the MiG-35.\n\n[6] Mikoyan MiG-35: The Mikoyan MiG-35 (; NATO reporting name: Fulcrum-F) is a Russian multirole fighter that is designed by Mikoyan, a division of the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC). Marketed as a 4++ generation jet fighter, it is a further development of the MiG-29M/M2 and MiG-29K/KUB fighters. The first prototype was a modification of the aircraft that previously served as a MiG-29M2 model demonstrator. Mikoyan first officially presented the MiG-35 internationally during the 2007 Aero India air show.\n\n[7] Mikoyan MiG-31: Syria ordered eight MiG-31E aircraft in 2007 for the Syrian Air Force. The order was suspended in May 2009 reportedly either due to Israeli pressure or lack of Syrian funds. On 15 August 2015, Turkish news media reported that six MiG-31s had been delivered to the Syrian Arab Air Force, but Russia denied making MiG-31 deliveries to Syria. On 4 April 1984, a MiG-31 crashed while on a test flight, killing Mikoyan chief test pilot and Hero of the Soviet Union, Aleksandr Vasilyevich Fedotov and his navigator V. Zaitsev.\n\n[8] Mikoyan MiG-33: During the early 1990s, it became briefly popular for Sukhoi and Mikoyan to assign new designations for upgraded models to make them appear \"new and improved\" instead of just \"improved\". The VVS did not accept these marketing designations and most were soon dropped. Following Sukhoi's initiative in this approach, Mikoyan's first such offering was the \"MiG-29ME\", which first publicly appeared as the \"MiG-33\" at the 1994 Farnborough Airshow. The MiG-29ME was the export version of the \"MiG-29M\" (Product 9.15) \"Super Fulcrum\", a comprehensively upgraded, fully multirole version of the MiG-29.\n\n[9] Mikoyan MiG-29: The Mikoyan MiG-29 (; NATO reporting name: Fulcrum) is a twin-engine jet fighter aircraft designed in the Soviet Union. Developed by the Mikoyan design bureau as an air superiority fighter during the 1970s, the MiG-29, along with the larger Sukhoi Su-27, was developed to counter new U.S. fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The MiG-29 entered service with the Soviet Air Forces in 1982.\n\n[10] Mikoyan MiG-29M: During the early 1990s, it became briefly popular for Sukhoi and Mikoyan to assign new designations for upgraded models to make them appear \"new and improved\" instead of just \"improved\".

It is reached by North Dakota Highway 8 on the American side and Saskatchewan Highway 9 on the Canadian side. This border crossing opened in 1962, when Highway 8 was built, which passed a half mile west of the small town of [[Northgate After being idle for years, the [[Canadian National Railway]] upgraded its tracks at this crossing to support rail traffic from the [[Bakken oil field]]. The US upgraded its border station on Highway 8 in 2004. [[File:Northgate ND old border station.jpg|thumb|left|Abandoned US border station at the former Northgate border crossing]]\n\n[2] Northgate, Malaysia: Northgate is strategically situated at Pengkalan Hulu, within the Hulu Perak district, Perak, Malaysia, which is also Perak state’s only Malaysia-Thailand border town. It is uniquely sited adjoining to the Malaysian Custom, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) checkpoint and the main road crossing between Malaysia and Thailand that connects directly to the Thailand’s southernmost town of Betong and with the Thai immigration and custom checkpoint only approximately 200m away. Neighbouring towns to the development are Baling (18 km) and Kelian Intan (18 km) and Gerik (50 km) at Malaysian side and Betong (7 km), Thailand. Prominent cities within close range to Northgate includes Sungai Petani (80 km), Penang Island (115 km), Butterworth (100 km) and Ipoh (190 km). Betong, which is synonym with its natural charms, friendly faces and excellent Thai cuisines has always been a choice of travelling for many tourists among local Malaysian and Thai southerners.\n\n[3] Neche–Gretna Border Crossing: The Neche–Gretna Border Crossing connects the cities of Neche, North Dakota and Gretna, Manitoba on the Canada–US border. It is connected by North Dakota Highway 18 on the American side and Manitoba Highway 30 on the Canadian side. Canada first established Gretna as a Port of Entry in 1883. This crossing is frequently closed due to flooding of the Pembina River, most recently in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2017.\n\n[4] Northgate, Queensland: Northgate railway station is also the junction for the Shorncliffe and North Coast Lines, with frequent services to the City, Shorncliffe and Caboolture and interurban services to Nambour/Gympie. Northgate train station is the branching point were both Shorncliffe and Caboolture trains can be caught, meaning that a lot of express trains stop at Northgate, for passengers making a switch between branches. Brisbane Transport also operates the \"306\" bus service through this suburb. The railway station was the limit of train service until the line was extended to Sandgate in the late 1880s.\n\n[5] Portal–North Portal Border Crossing: The Portal–North Portal Border Crossing connects the cities of Portal, North Dakota and North Portal, Saskatchewan. This crossing is the only 24-hour crossing on the North Dakota–Saskatchewan border. It is reached by U.S. Route 52 on the American side and Saskatchewan Highway 39 on the Canadian side. A major Canadian Pacific Railway crossing exists at this crossing as well. The Gateway Cities Golf Club, which was built in 1931 is adjacent to this crossing. While the majority of the 9-hole course is in Canada, the 9th green is in the US, requiring golfers to hit a shot across the Canada–US border.\n\n[6] Ogdensburg–Prescott Border Crossing: The Ogdensburg–Prescott Border Crossing connects the cities of Ogdensburg, New York and Johnstown, Ontario on the Canada–United States border, and is located at the Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge. Even though it is located 3 miles (5 km) northeast of the cities, the bridge and the border crossing are named for Ogdensburg and Prescott because they were intended to replace ferry service between the two cities when the bridge was built in 1960. Prior to 1960, vessels crossed between Ogdensburg and Prescott (and border inspections were conducted) since 1800.\n\n[7] Eastport-Kingsgate Border Crossing: The Eastport-Kingsgate Border Crossing connects the town of Bonners Ferry, Idaho with Yahk, British Columbia on the Canada–US border. It can be reached by U.S. Route 95 on the American side and British Columbia Highway 95 on the Canadian side. The Spokane International Railroad first crossed the border at this location in 1906, connecting Spokane with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Canada built its first border station at Kingsgate later that year; the US station is one of two in Idaho, and many trucks travel between British Columbia and the US Interstate system at Interstate 90 a hundred miles to the south. This crossing is open 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n\n[8] Northgate, Malaysia: Geared with the local natural beauty and spices from Thai, Northgate will no doubt enjoy best of both worlds as a tourist centric development meant for short breakaways for affordable entertainment, leisure and shopping destination for surrounding cities such as Penang, Sungai Petani, Kuala Kangsar, Taiping, Ipoh or even Kuala Lumpur and Singaporean. The location is much closer as compare to other Malaysia-Thailand border towns such as Bukit Kayu Hitam and Padang Besar. Its unique position will also tap into the huge market of the southern Thai who uses this exit as their primary gateway to Malaysia.\n\n[9] Union City, New Jersey: The city is bisected by New Jersey Route 495, a vehicular cut built in conjunction with the Lincoln Tunnel. Soon after its construction, many street names were abandoned in favor of numbering in most of North Hudson starting at 2nd Street, just north of Paterson Plank Road, which runs through the city's only major park and creates its border with Jersey City. 49th Street is the northern boundary with West New York. Apart from a small section between Bergen Turnpike and Weehawken Cemetery, Kennedy Boulevard, a major north-south thoroughfare, creates the western border with North Bergen. A former colonial road and previous border between the merged municipalities takes three names as it diagonally crosses the city's urban grid: Hackensack Plank Road, 32nd Street, and Bergen Turnpike. Most of the city north of the street, formerly Union Hill, shares its eastern border along Park Avenue with Weehawken. The southern section of the city, formerly West Hoboken, is indeed west of Hoboken, which it overlooks and is connected by the road which creates their shared border, the Wing Viaduct.\n\n[10] Easton - River de Chute Border Crossing: The Easton - River de Chute Border Crossing connects the towns of Easton, Maine and Wicklow, New Brunswick on the Canada–US border. Historically, two roads entered Easton from Canada, but in the late 1950s, the Canada closed its Beaconsfield crossing on Nicholson Road, so the US government moved its border station from its original location near the intersection of Ladner and Curtis Roads. After the move, the US Customs Service operated out of at least three different mobile trailers until 2012, when it finally constructed a permanent border inspection station.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Itak means \"point of mountain\" in the O'odham language. European settlers had referred to this place as Rocky Point at least through the early part of the twentieth century. On September 8, 1939 the Office of Indian Affairs (now Bureau of Indian Affairs) petitioned the USGS to officially recognize the name of the location as Itak, as that was the name preferred by the local residents, and was more historical. On April 10, 1941 the Board on Geographic Names rendered its decision, officially naming the place Itak. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.\n\n[2] Itak gurgur: The word \"\"gurgur\"\" here means \"burning\". Giving \"itak gurgur\" to someone signifies that the recipient has the spirit of a burning ember.\n\n[3] Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi: Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) (, ) is a Sri Lankan political party which represents the Sri Lankan Tamil ethnic minority in the country. It was originally formed in 1949 as breakaway faction of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In 1972 ITAK merged with the ACTC and Ceylon Workers' Congress (CWC) to form the Tamil United Front, which later changed its name to Tamil United Liberation Front. ITAK remained dormant until 2004 when a split in the TULF resulted in ITAK being re-established as an active political party. ITAK is constituent party of the Tamil National Alliance.\n\n[4] Tatai Toak, Arizona: Tatai Toak is a populated place situated in Pima County, Arizona. The small village is located on the San Xavier Indian Reservation, and its name is derived from the O'odham for \"roadrunner mountain\". Historically, it has also been known as Road Runner Village, Perigua, and Tatria Toak. The name officially became Tatia Toak by a decision of the Board on Geographic Names in 1964. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level.\n\n[5] Yuraq Apachita (Azángaro): Yuraq Apachita (Quechua \"yuraq\" white, Aymara \"apachita\" the place of transit of an important pass in the principal routes of the Andes; name for a stone cairn in the Andes, a little pile of rocks built along the trail in the high mountains, hispanicized spelling \"Yurac Apacheta\") is a mountain in the Peruvian Andes, about high. It is located in the Puno Region, Azángaro Province, San Antón District. Yuraq Apachita lies southwest of the mountain Ichhu Muruq'u and northeast of Hatun Anta. It is situated at the river Tawqani \"(Taucane)\".\n\n[6] M. K. Eelaventhan: Kanagentran was an active member of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) but in 1970 joined V. Navaratnam's Tamil Self Rule Party. He later re-joined ITAK, which was now part of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). Kanagentran was president of the TULF's Colombo branch. He was a victim of the 1977 riots. He became a high profile advocate of Tamil Eelam and changed his name to Eelaventhan which means \"King of Eelam\" in Tamil. In 1980 he and others left ITAK to form the Tamil Eelam Liberation Front (TELF). Eelaventhan was TELF's secretary.\n\n[7] Ali Ak Chin, Arizona: Ali Ak Chin, is a populated place located in Pima County, Arizona. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level. The name was created to avoid confusion with the village on the Papago Indian Reservation, Ak Chin, and means \"little mouth of wash\" in the Papago language.\n\n[8] Arcata, California: The Wiyot people and Yurok people inhabited this area prior to the arrival of Europeans, and continue to live in the area to this day. \"Kori\" is the name for the Wiyot settlement that existed on the site of what would become Arcata. The name \"Arcata\" comes from the Yurok term \"oket'oh\", meaning \"where there is a lagoon\" (referring to Humboldt Bay), from \"o-\", \"place\", plus \"ket'oh\", \"to be a lagoon\". The same name was also used by the Yuroks for Big Lagoon. The natives of this region are the farthest-southwest people whose language has Algic roots, a language family related to Algonquian. The traditional homeland of the Wiyot ranged from the Little River in the north and continues south through Humboldt Bay (including the present cities of Eureka and Arcata) and then south to the lower Eel River basin. The traditional homeland of the Yurok ranges from Mad River to beyond the Klamath River in the north. Today, Arcata is the headquarters of the Big Lagoon Rancheria tribe, who maintain a reservation close by. California does not have any true sovereign nation Indian tribes and all tribal lands and tribal members are subject to state and local regulations with some notable exceptions. The tribes do maintain exclusive civil jurisdiction. The Local Indian tribes operate several casinos in the area. In a coordinated 1860 massacre, significant numbers of Wiyot people were killed at several locations in and around Humboldt Bay, including the center of their society, the island known to them as Duluwat Island. A local newspaper editor, who would later be known as Bret Harte, was forced to leave the Humboldt Bay area after he editorialized his disgust with the incident.\n\n[9] Kui Tatk, Arizona: Kui Tatk is a populated place located on the Tohono O'odham Indian Reservation in Pima County, Arizona. It has an estimated elevation of above sea level. Its name means \"mesquite root\" in the Tohono O'odham language. Historically it has also been known by the variant, Kvitatk. It has also incorrectly been identified as Iron Pipe (translated into the O'odham as \"Vainom Kug\"), which is the name of a village which sprang up around a steam pump built by miners about a mile away. The name, and its current spelling, was reached as a decision by the Board on Geographic Names in 1941. The original Indian settlement was abandoned in the 1850s, when its inhabitants migrated to different locations such as Gu Oidak, Pan Tak, and Gu Chuapo.\n\n[10] Abak/Midim Clan: Abak/Midim is one of the nine Clans or Districts in Oruk Anam local government area of Akwa Ibom State. It is as well one of the two Clans or Districts in the former Anam Local Government Area. both in the south south Nigeria. Abak/Midim is bounded in the north by Ibesit/Nung Ikot Clan of Oruk Anam, in the South by Edemaya Clan of Ikot Abasi, in the east by Ikpa Nung Asang (Essene) Clan of Ikot Abasi, and in the west by Imoh River, also called Imo River which separates Akwa Ibom State from the Ogoni Nation of Rivers State.

Between 1965 and 1969 they toured extensively in Australia, New Zealand, South East Asia and the Pacific Islands, including 6 months performing at military bases in Vietnam during 1967–1968. In 1969 the band went to the United States, and performed there through to early 1975, at which point they returned to Australia. In 1977 the Vamps were renamed Peaches and played in Australasia and the Pacific until they disbanded in 1980. Founder of the band and lead guitarist Margaret Britt continues to perform with Skyz the Limit.\n\n[2] The Vamps (Australian band): In 1975 Britt and her husband Jon Kirk returned to Australia and performed throughout eastern Australia, including a gig in outback Birdsville. During 1977 Britt put together an all-female line-up and, upon the recommendation of Gene Pierson of Laser Records, the name Vamps was dropped and replaced with Peaches. This new band had a hit with the single \"Substitute\". The group was disbanded in 1980.\n\n[3] The Vamps (Australian band): Early in 1967 the Vamps were offered a tour of Vietnam and in May Britt put together a new line-up with Melbourne musicians Linda Cable, Terri Scott and Marilyn Ockwell. This was short-lived and they only played a few gigs in Melbourne and Sydney. Britt replaced the three Victorians in July with Julie Hibberd, Carol Middlemiss, Val Falloon and Denise Cooper. Falloon had recently arrived from England where she had written and produced a single for Mike Hamilton which was issued on Decca Records. The Vamps went on to tour Vietnam between October 1967 and March 1968, with stopovers in Nouméa on the way there and Singapore on the return trip. Following their arrival in Australia in April 1968 Val Falloon left and was replaced by Joy Carroll. The band then performed in venues along the east coast before heading off on a Pacific Islands and South East Asian tour in September. The Vamps were out of the country until February 1969, at which point they once again played in Sydney and Melbourne, before leaving for the United States in May of that year. The Vamps toured as an all-female 4-piece with various personnel through to March 1971 when Margaret Britt's husband Jon Kirk joined the band and it was renamed Jon and the Vamps, or Jon and the Australian Vamps. They played in Australia during a brief visit in April 1972 and upon returning to the United States in June the band was expanded to an 8-piece. They performed around the country in 38 States, including Hawaii, almost continuously until February 1975, with Margaret Britt the only non-American member. Upon returning to Australia in 1975 the Vamps travelled throughout New South Wales, Victoria and to Birdsville, Queensland. In 1977 a new all-female line-up was recruited by Britt and adopted the name\n\n[4] The Vamps (Australian band): In April 1965 Margaret Britt, following two years performing in New Zealand, decided to form an all-female rock group. This was at the time a novel idea, as it was only the previous year that recordings by the first all-girl band of the pop era – Goldie and the Gingerbreads – had appeared, followed shortly thereafter by The Pleasure Seekers, featuring a young Suzi Quatro. Britt initially put together a 4-piece band comprising herself, Kaye Gazzard, Wendy Walton and Judy Owen. They performed a mix of instrumentals and contemporary pop and rock and roll songs. Their first gig was at Stomp City, AMOCO Centre, Orange in June 1965, where they drew a record crowd of 2030. Following this a fifth member – Janice Glading (stage name Babs King) – was added on vocals. The Vamps played the Millers Hotel circuit in Sydney and other venues through to the end of 1965. They also appeared on the Don Lane television show, performing \"Twist and Shout\". At one point in late 1965 Richard Neville of OZ magazine fame was considering managing the band, but he left for London early in 1966. In February of that year Britt put together a new version of the Vamps, with Jan Little, Merlene Ryder, Elaine Neilsen and Lisa-Kay James. They toured extensively throughout eastern Australia, including the showground circuit in Queensland. During September they were joined by Denise Cooper on vocals, following the departure of Neilsen. Whilst performing in Brisbane the Vamps recorded two numbers for the IN television show on BTQ7, these being \"House of the Rising Sun\" and \"Hanky Panky\".\n\n[5] The Vamps (Australian band): The Vamps left Australia in May 1969 for an 8-week tour of the United States and stayed for 6 years. The 4-piece initially comprised Margaret Britt, Carol Middlemiss, Julie Hibberd and Joy Carroll. Middlemiss departed in September and was replaced by American Mary Kay Kuenzli. At the end of 1970 both Carroll and Kuenzli left and were replaced by the Petrak sister, Cheryl and Micky. They were part of the line-up when the Vamps performed at Tehachapi Prison, California in February 1971. Shortly thereafter the Petraks left and the band now became Jon and the Australian Vamps, comprising Margaret Britt, her husband Jon Kirk, Julie Hibberd and American Diane Smith. This 4-piece worked through to the latter part of 1971. Smith left for a period and the group was joined by drummer Nancy Kuminkovski. This line-up recorded two singles in September 1971. Smith subsequently rejoined the band and following a brief visit to Australia in April 1972 both her and Hibberd left upon their return to the States. Britt and Kirk subsequently put together an 8-piece band and performed around the country and at events such as the Kentucky Derby and the Indianapolis 500. They were based out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and had gigs in Las Vegas, Birmingham, Nashville, St. Petersburg, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, to name a few. All told some 38 States were visited by the band between 1969–75.\n\n[6] The Vamps (British band): In February 2015, The Vamps announced they had launched their own record label along with Universal Music and EMI Records, having signed the American pop rock band The Tide as their first act, but the label didn't have a name yet. Only in October it was revealed it would be called Steady Records. On 15 September 2015, the band announced their new single \"Wake Up\" which was released on 2 October 2015. Their second studio album \"Wake Up\" was released on 27 November 2015. They performed at fanfests in Europe to promote the album and a world tour called \"Wake Up World Tour\" which started in January 2016. The song debuted and peaked at number 12 in the UK Singles Chart and the album debuted at 10 in the UK Albums Chart, selling over 27 thousand copies in the country in its first week. The second single off the album, \"Rest Your Love\", was released on the same day as the album. In December 2015, The Vamps announced they had signed the British band New Hope Club and that they would be one of the opening acts in the UK leg of their \"Wake Up World Tour\".\n\n[7] Peaches (musician): The Herms (short for hermaphrodites) were formed in spring 2006 as Peaches' live backing band. They played at both small and large venues with sex and sex-related themes as the \"shock factor\" for the audience. \"Herms\" is also a reference to 1970s duo Peaches & Herb and the blending of the words 'her' and 'him'. Peaches and Herms was the opening act for Nine Inch Nails and Bauhaus during the second half of their 2006 summer U.S. tour.\n\n[8] Peaches (musician): Born in Ontario to a Jewish family, Peaches began her musical career in the 1990s as part of a folk trio, Mermaid Cafe. In 1995, she established a rock band, the Shit. That year she also released her first solo album, \"Fancypants Hoodlum\". Moving to Berlin, Germany, it was here that she was signed to the Kitty-Yo label and released her second album, \"The Teaches of Peaches\" (2000). Touring as the opening act for bands like Marilyn Manson and Queens of the Stone Age, she subsequently released her third album, \"Fatherfucker\" (2003).\n\n[9] Vamps (band): Vamps is a Japanese rock duo formed in 2008 by Hyde (vocalist, rhythm guitarist, lyricist and composer) and K.A.Z (lead guitarist, backing vocalist and composer). Only a year after their founding, Vamps performed its first international tour, ten dates in the United States, and in 2010 they went on their first world tour. Originally signed to Hyde's own record label Vamprose, every release the band has had to date has reached the top ten on the Oricon music chart. In 2013, the group changed labels to Universal Music Group's Delicious Deli Records and produced their worldwide debut release.\n\n[10] The Moldy Peaches: Green and Dawson met at Exile on Main Street Records in Mount Kisco, New York and began working together. Green put out a 7\" Ep called \"X-Ray Vision\" under the name The Moldy Peaches, featuring recordings he made from 1994–96 with Dawson and various other friends, notably Jules Sheridan, a songwriter based in Scotland. Green and Dawson recorded a CDR album in 1998 under the name Moldy Peaches 2000 called \"FER THE KIDS\" before Dawson moved to Port Townsend, Washington. In early 1999 Green joined her there, and more home and live recordings transpired. The band returned to NYC as a 4 piece later in the year (including Jest Commons, guitar, and Justin Campbell, drums). They became active on the NYC anti-folk scene, playing at the SideWalk Cafe before the band broke up. Dawson and Green both recorded solo albums. The band reformed in August 2000 with Chris Barron of the Spin Doctors on lead guitar, Brian Piltin on bass guitar, and Strictly Beats (Brent Cole) on drums. (The \"2000\" was dropped from their name around this time). A new 11 song album was recorded, which led to a deal with Rough Trade in the UK. They gained recognition after their initial 7\" 'Who's Got the Crack\" was named 'Single of the Week' in \"NME\". Rough Trade released the album \"The Moldy Peaches\" in 2001. Released in the U.S. on September 11, 2001, it contained the song \"NYC Is Like a Graveyard\". The band expanded to a six-piece, with guitarists Jack Dishel and Aaron Wilkinson, bass player Steven Mertens, and drummer Strictly Beats, augmenting the original duo of Dawson and Green. They toured internationally\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nDirector Taika Waititi also played which comedic Thor: Ragnarok character?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Thor: Ragnarok: Additionally, Tadanobu Asano, Ray Stevenson, and Zachary Levi reprise their roles as Hogun, Volstagg, and Fandral, respectively, members of the Warriors Three. Feige called their appearances \"noble ends\" that served to establish the threat of Hela and the danger she poses to the main characters. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Dr. Stephen Strange from the film \"Doctor Strange\" (2016). Rachel House, who has appeared in several of Waititi's films, plays Topaz, the Grandmaster's bodyguard, while Waititi portrays Korg, a gladiator who befriends Thor. Waititi provided a motion-capture performance for the character, who is made of rocks, and wanted to do something different by having the character be soft-spoken, ultimately basing Korg's voice on that of Polynesian bouncers. Waititi also provided the motion-capture performance for the fire demon Surtur, based on the mythological being Surtr, with Clancy Brown voicing the character. Thor and Hulk co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a man on Sakaar who cuts Thor's hair. There are also several cameos in a sequence where Asgardian actors perform a play based on the events of \"The Dark World\": Sam Neill, with whom Waititi previously worked on \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\" (2016), plays the Odin actor; Luke Hemsworth, brother of Chris, plays the Thor actor; and Matt Damon plays the Loki actor.\n\n[2] Thor: Ragnarok: In mid-September 2016, concept art seen during a set visit indicated Midgard Serpent would appear, and that Sif and the Warriors Three, allies of Thor in the previous two films, would be addressed in \"Ragnarok\". Towards the end of the month, Sam Neill, who worked with Waititi in \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\", revealed he had a role in the film. Shortly after, Waititi teased the inclusion of the characters Korg, who Waititi portrays through motion-capture, and Miek, who is not portrayed by an actor as he does not speak in the film, and is depicted as \"a larva-like creature... [with] cybernetic legs and arms\". In mid-October, Waititi revealed that new camera technology had been used for a shot in the film, and that he had hoped to include John C. Reilly's Nova Corpsman Rhomann Dey in the film, but there was \"no real way to pull it off\". Principal photography wrapped on October 28, 2016. Second unit filming took place on Dirk Hartog Island off the coast of Australia, and in the South Island of New Zealand. According to Waititi, 80 percent of the dialogue in \"Thor: Ragnarok\" was improvised, in order to create a \"very loose and collaborate mood\" among the cast and an attempt to replicate the tone and sensibility from his previous films. He stated, \"My style of working is I'll often be behind the camera, or right next to the camera yelling words at people, like, 'Say this, say this! Say it this way!\n\n[3] Thor: Ragnarok: By the release of \"Ragnarok\", Waititi and Marvel had discussed a spin-off Marvel One-Shot short film following the characters Korg and Miek, but it was unfeasible due to Marvel's commitment to producing three feature films a year. Feige said Marvel still had plans for those characters, but did not specify. In January 2018, Hemsworth indicated his interest in continuing to play Thor, despite his contract with Marvel Studios scheduled to end after \"Avengers: Endgame\", saying the next month \"if there's another great script that comes along\" he would consider playing the character again. He and Waititi had discussed what they would want in a potential fourth \"Thor\" film by then.\n\n[4] Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe): By the events of \"Thor: Ragnarok\", Thor has become a \"lone gunslinger\" searching for the Infinity Stones. Hemsworth had become \"a bit bored\" with the character by this time, and wanted to take some risks and experiment: the character has shorter hair in the film, wears a different outfit, his hammer Mjolnir is destroyed, and he loses an eye. Director Taika Waititi added that \"stripping\" the character down like this allowed him to become a refugee at the end of the film. Waititi also wanted to use more of Hemsworth's comedic talents showcased in films like \"Vacation\" (2015) and \"Ghostbusters\" (2016), and cited Kurt Russell's portrayal of Jack Burton from \"Big Trouble in Little China\" (1986) as an influence on the character. The events of \"Infinity War\" come right on the heels of \"Ragnarok\", finding Thor in a \"very profound... very interesting place\" with \"real emotional motivation\". At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted \"Thor: Ragnarok\" director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film. Joe Russo said that Thor has \"the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument\" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos.\n\n[5] Thor (film): \"Thor: Ragnarok\" was released on November 3, 2017, directed by Taika Waititi. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay, with Kevin Feige again producing. Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Hopkins, Elba, Asano, Zachary Levi, and Stevenson reprised their roles as Thor, Loki, Odin, Heimdall, Hogun, Fandral, and Volstagg, respectively, while Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch appeared as Bruce Banner / Hulk and Stephen Strange respectively, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban joined the cast as Hela, Valkyrie, Grandmaster, and Skurge, respectively.\n\n[6] Thor: The Dark World: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences placed \"Thor: The Dark World\" on its shortlist of potential nominees for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects but ultimately did not nominate it. \"Thor: Ragnarok\" was released on November 3, 2017, directed by Taika Waititi. Eric Pearson and Craig Kyle & Christopher Yost wrote the screenplay, with Kevin Feige again producing. Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Hopkins, Elba, Asano, Levi, and Stevenson reprise their roles as Thor, Loki, Odin, Heimdall, Hogun, Fandral, and Volstagg, respectively, while Mark Ruffalo and Benedict Cumberbatch appear as Bruce Banner / Hulk and Doctor Strange respectively, reprising their roles from previous MCU films. Cate Blanchett, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum and Karl Urban join the cast as Hela, Valkyrie, Grandmaster, and Skurge, respectively.\n\n[7] Thor: Ragnarok: Thor: Ragnarok is a 2017 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's \"Thor\" and 2013's \"\", and is the seventeenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Taika Waititi from a screenplay by Eric Pearson and the writing team of Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost, and stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor alongside Tom Hiddleston, Cate Blanchett, Idris Elba, Jeff Goldblum, Tessa Thompson, Karl Urban, Mark Ruffalo, and Anthony Hopkins. In \"Thor: Ragnarok\", Thor must escape the alien planet Sakaar in time to save Asgard from Hela and the impending Ragnarök.\n\n[8] Thor: Ragnarok: In February 2017, Rachel House said she had a small role in the film, having worked with Waititi before. Additional filming took place in Atlanta in July 2017, over three weeks, including filming post-credit scenes. One of these introduces the spaceship \"Sanctuary II\", which belongs to Thanos in \"Avengers: Infinity War\", while the other, shown at the end of the credits, features the Grandmaster. Goldblum and Waititi improvised multiple versions of the latter scene; one unused version involved the singing of the Sakaarian national anthem, which was \"made up on the spot\". Also filmed in Atlanta was the completion of a sequence where Asgardian actors perform a play based on the events of \"The Dark World\". Neill appears in the sequence as the Odin actor, and Hemsworth's brother Luke portrays the Thor actor. Explaining the sequence, Waititi said, \"if I was Loki and I was ruling Asgard, I would write a play about myself and force everyone to go and see it—change the details of the play and get a huge celebrity to play myself.\" For the Loki actor, they \"really wanted someone good and someone who's funny\", and Chris Hemsworth suggested that Matt Damon, whom he knew personally, take on the role. Damon was in New York City at the time, and flew to Atlanta just to shoot the cameo \"on a lark\". Also changed during reshoots was the location of the sequence where Thor and Loki find Odin on Earth, and Hela subsequently destroys Mjolnir. Originally set in a New York City alley, Waititi decided that the environment was distracting from the emotions of the sequence. The location was changed to Norway, which Waititi felt gave more weight to the scenes, made Odin's storyline more \"authentic\", and also allowed the characters and the audience to \"chill\n\n[9] Thor: Ragnarok: In April, Tessa Thompson was cast as Valkyrie, with Natalie Portman not returning from the previous films as love interest Jane Foster. Marvel never asked the screenwriters to include the Earth-based characters from the previous films, and Feige said that Foster and Thor have broken up between films. In May, Marvel confirmed Blanchett and Thompson for the film, announced the casting of Jeff Goldblum as Grandmaster and Karl Urban as Skurge, and revealed that Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins would reprise their respective roles of Heimdall and Odin from the previous films. In early June, Palaszczuk and Marvel Studios executive David Grant announced that filming would begin on July 4, 2016, with Weta Workshop creating props for the film. Before the sets for Marvel's \"Doctor Strange\" were demolished, Waititi wrote and filmed a scene for \"Ragnarok\" where Thor meets Benedict Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange. Marvel and \"Doctor Strange\" director Scott Derrickson felt the scene was \"kind of perfect\" to show Strange joining the wider MCU, so the scene also appears during the credits of \"Doctor Strange\".\n\n[10] Thor: Ragnarok: In January 2016, with the film beginning pre-production, Ruffalo described it as a \"road movie\" and indicated that additional filming would take place in Sydney. Waititi stated that he was working on the script \"a little bit\", mainly adding humor to the screenplay, with Eric Pearson joining the project to rewrite the screenplay. Pearson felt joining presented many challenges, as \"there were so many puzzle pieces already there,\" such as having Blanchett as Hela, who was confirmed in the role a month later, and including Hulk, Valkyrie, and Skurge, that he was asked to assemble. Pearson was told not to be restrained by anything from the previous films, and Waititi asked him to make the film fun and have Thor \"be the coolest character.\" Alexander said in early March that she was no longer sure if she would appear in the film, due to scheduling conflicts with her television series \"Blindspot\". She later indicated that this may not be the case, but ultimately was unable to appear in the film due to the conflict. Sif does appear as a character in the play based on the events of \"The Dark World\", portrayed by Charlotte Nicdao.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat year is on the flag of the US state Wisconsin?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Flag of Wisconsin: In order to distinguish it from the many other blue U.S. state flags, Wisconsin's flag was modified in 1979 to add \"Wisconsin\" and \"1848\", the year Wisconsin was admitted to the Union. All Wisconsin state flags manufactured after May 1, 1981, were required to use this design.\n\n[2] Perote Guards: The company's uniforms and flag were handmade by the ladies of Perote. The flag was presented to the Guards in September 1860 by Miss Crossley and received for the company by M. B. Locke on the steps of the Methodist Church. Upon receipt of a regimental flag, in the summer of 1861, the company flags were placed with the regimental quartermaster for safe keeping. Following the surrender of the 1st Alabama Infantry, the flag was seized from the company baggage by members of the 15th Wisconsin Infantry and eventually carried back to Wisconsin. Dr. Thomas Owen, Director of the Alabama Department of Archives and History, learned of the flag's location and requested its return in the summer of 1903. Ruben G. Thwaites, Secretary of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, replied on June 19, 1903, that he felt the Society would be quite willing to return the flag. This, however, would require a resolution by the Wisconsin legislature which did not meet again until January 1905. On March 15, 1905 Alabamas acting Governor Russel M. Cunningham requested that the flag be returned. Joint Resolution Number 29-S of the Legislature of the State of Wisconsin, April 13, 1905, approved the return of the flag and it was finally received on August 5, 1905.\n\n[3] Flag of Madison, Wisconsin: In the original design, adopted by the municipal government on April 12 1962 and used until July 2018, the shape overlaid on the cross was a Zia sun symbol, sacred to the Native American Zia Pueblo of New Mexico, which is used to symbolize the state's Pueblo heritage on New Mexican iconography such as the Flag of New Mexico and the Flag of Albuquerque. While intended by the flag designers to represent an \"Indian sun symbol\", it is not used by any of the Native American groups in the Wisconsin area. Similar sun symbols appears on the municipal flag of Wichita, Kansas.\n\n[4] Flag of Madison, Wisconsin: The flag of Madison, Wisconsin, consists of a light blue background bisected from lower left to upper right by a white band, symbolizing Lake Mendota and Lake Monona and the isthmus between them. In the center of the flag is a black cross, which symbolizes the four lakes (Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Waubesa), as well as the cross shape of the Wisconsin State Capitol. The original flag was designed by Rick and Dennis Stone, who were members of the Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps, with the help of their color guard instructor.\n\n[5] Stony Hill School (Waubeka, Wisconsin): The 19-year-old teacher at the school, Bernard J. Cigrand, had a profound love for the flag of the United States. Cigrand began specially honoring the flag on June 14, 1885 at the school, the anniversary of the flag's adoption. In 1916, inspired by Cigrand's actions, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed June 14 to be Flag Day, though the day was not officially established by an Act of Congress until 1949, and Cigrand became known as the \"Father of Flag Day\". Coincidentally, the school ceased operations in 1916. In 1947, the National Fraternal Congress moved for the school to be restored and by 1952 the restorations were complete.\n\n[6] Waubeka, Wisconsin: The origin of Flag Day is traced to Waubeka. In 1885, Stony Hill School teacher Bernard John Cigrand displayed a flag in an inkwell and had his students write essays on what the flag meant to them. He told the students that June 14 was the birthday of the flag. The school is now considered a historic site.\n\n[7] Flag of Wisconsin: In 1975, some state flags were being sold that improperly had the state seal on them instead of the state coat of arms. Wisconsin Secretary of State Douglas J. La Follette noted that the correct state flag did not have the banner of thirteen stars at the bottom.\n\n[8] Flag Day (United States): Perhaps the oldest continuing Flag Day parade is in Fairfield, Washington. Beginning in 1909 or 1910, Fairfield has held a parade every year since, with the possible exception of 1918, and celebrated the \"Centennial\" parade in 2010, along with some other commemorative events. Appleton, Wisconsin, claims to be the oldest National Flag Day parade in the nation, held annually since 1950.\n\n[9] Flag of the United States: The current design of the U.S. flag is its 27th; the design of the flag has been modified officially 26 times since 1777. The 48-star flag was in effect for 47 years until the 49-star version became official on July 4, 1959. The 50-star flag was ordered by the then president Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, and was adopted in July 1960. It is the longest-used version of the U.S. flag and has been in use for over years.\n\n[10] Janesville, Wisconsin: Janesville developed its first flag in 2015 in a design contest held in Janesville's schools. The winning flag was adopted by the city council in March 2015, and unveiled on June 15, 2015. The flag represents the community's past, present, and future, with 1853 representing the year Janesville was incorporated, four stars symbolizing the city’s four original wards, a green background standing for the community's agricultural industry, and black representing both the rich soil for which Janesville is known, and the smoke that billowed from smokestacks as the community developed a manufacturing economy. The tree in the center is the city's logo, representing Janesville's slogan, \"Wisconsin’s Park Place.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The Bulls entered the season as defending NBA champions, having defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals in five games, and winning their first NBA championship in franchise history. Early into the season, the Bulls traded Dennis Hopson to the Sacramento Kings after the first two games. Coming off their first ever championship, the Bulls had a very successful season winning 14 consecutive games after a 1–2 start to the season. They later on posted a 13-game winning streak in January, which led them to a 37–5 start. The Bulls finished in first place in the Central Division, along with having the best record in the league at 67–15. Michael Jordan captured his second straight MVP, and sixth straight scoring title. He was also selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game along with Scottie Pippen.\n\n[2] 1991–92 Cleveland Cavaliers season: The 1991–92 NBA season was the 22nd season of the National Basketball Association in Cleveland, Ohio. During the offseason, the Cavaliers signed unrestricted free agent John Battle. After two straight seasons of injuries, the Cavaliers would finally play the entire season without any significant loss of manpower. After a 13–9 start to the season, the team posted an 11-game winning streak, finishing the season 2nd in the Central Division with a 57–25 record, and tying the franchise high set in the 1988–89 season. On December 17 1991, the Cavaliers set an NBA record by winning with the largest margin of victory of any game defeating the Miami Heat 148-80 (68 points).Mark Price and Brad Daugherty were both selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game and named to the All-NBA Third Team. In the first round of the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the New Jersey Nets in the four games, then in the semifinals defeated Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics in a full seven game series. However, in the Eastern Conference Finals, they would lose to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls four games to two.\n\n[3] 1991–92 Boston Celtics season: The 1991–92 NBA season was the 46th season for the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. This marked the final NBA season for All-Star forward Larry Bird, who missed nearly half of the season games due to a nagging back injury. However, one of the season highlights was a 49-point performance from Bird in a nationally televised double-overtime win over eventual Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. It was the most points for Bird since February 15, 1988, when he scored 49 at Phoenix Suns. Bird was also selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game along with Reggie Lewis, but did not play due to injury.\n\n[4] 1991–92 Charlotte Hornets season: The 1991–92 NBA season was the Charlotte Hornets' fourth season in the National Basketball Association. With the top overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft, the Hornets selected UNLV star Larry Johnson. Under new head coach Allan Bristow, the Hornets would get off to a slow start losing 8 of their first 9 games. At midseason, Rex Chapman was traded to the Washington Bullets as the Hornets would get stronger winning 9 of 13 games in February, on their way to finishing sixth in the Central Division with a record of 31 wins and 51 losses, a five-game improvement over the previous season. Johnson averaged 19.2 points and 11.0 rebounds per game, as he went on to win the 1992 NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He was also in the Slam Dunk Contest. Second-year star Kendall Gill led the team in scoring with 20.5 points per game. The Hornets led the NBA in attendance for the third time in four seasons.\n\n[5] 1991–92 Detroit Pistons season: The 1991–92 NBA season was the Pistons' 44th season in the National Basketball Association, and 35th season in the city of Detroit. During the offseason, the Pistons acquired Orlando Woolridge from the Denver Nuggets. The Pistons got off to a slow start with a 9–13 record, but managed to win 10 of their next 13 games. They won seven consecutive games in March, then won six in a row in April, finishing third in the Central Division with a 48–34 record. Three members of the team, Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman were all selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game. Despite leading the league with an incredible 18.7 rebounds per game, Rodman fell short of his quest for a third straight Defensive Player of The Year award. Throughout the season, speculation that it was Chuck Daly's last season as coach of the Pistons lingered in the media, intensifying as the season went out and well into the playoffs.\n\n[6] 1991–92 Portland Trail Blazers season: The 1991–92 NBA season was the 22nd season for the Portland Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Association. After losing three of their first four games, the Blazers would quickly recover as they continued to lead the way in the West posting a 57–25 record, earning their second straight Pacific Division championship and 10th consecutive trip to the NBA Playoffs. Clyde Drexler led the way averaging 25.0 points per game while being named to the All-NBA First Team, selected for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game, and finishing a distant second to Michael Jordan in the MVP ballot.\n\n[7] 1992 NBA Finals: The Bulls won their first NBA championship the previous season, ushering in a new era in the league. Proving that their maiden championship was no fluke, the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, finishing with a 67–15 record, surpassing last season's record by six games. Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with a 30.1/6.4/6.1 season.\n\n[8] 1991–92 Portland Trail Blazers season: The Blazers' dream of winning their second NBA title, however, was stifled by the Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen-led Bulls, who defeated the Blazers 4–2 and won their second straight NBA title. Following the season, Danny Ainge signed as a free agent with the Phoenix Suns.\n\n[9] 1992 NBA All-Star Game: The 1992 NBA All-Star Game was the 42nd edition of the All-Star Game. The event took place at the Orlando Arena in Orlando, Florida. The West defeated the East, 153–113. The game is most remembered for the return of Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson, who retired before the 1991–92 NBA season after contracting HIV. Johnson won the MVP award after winning memorable one-on-one showdowns with Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan and then sinking a long three pointer to close the game, as the final 14½ seconds that remained on the clock were not played.\n\n[10] 1991–92 Indiana Pacers season: The 1991–92 NBA season was the Pacers' 16th season in the National Basketball Association, and 25th season as a franchise. The Pacers struggled early into the season losing 9 of their first 13 games, which led them to a 15–28 record near the end of January. However, they won 25 of their final 39 games, finishing the season fourth in the Central Division with a mediocre 40–42 record. Reggie Miller led the Pacers in scoring with 20.7 points per game, while Chuck Person finished second on the team with 18.5 points per game. Detlef Schrempf was named Sixth Man of The Year for the second consecutive season, averaging 17.3 points per game off the bench. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the Boston Celtics for the second straight season, where they were swept in three straight games. Following the season, Person and Micheal Williams were both traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 after the root of the word \"dyspepsia\" and the kola nuts used in the recipe. The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla. Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.\n\n[2] Pepsi: Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by PepsiCo. Originally created and developed in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and introduced as Brad's Drink, it was renamed as Pepsi-Cola on August 28, 1898, and then as Pepsi in 1961.\n\n[3] Pepsi Raw: Pepsi Raw was a cola soft drink created by PepsiCo and Britvic exclusively introduced in the United Kingdom in 2008 as a \"Sparkling Cola Drink with Natural Plant Extracts\". Pepsi Raw contained naturally sourced ingredients that are free from artificial flavouring, colourings, preservatives and sweeteners. Advertising for Pepsi Raw presented the product as a natural alternative to other colas. Pepsi Raw was also being marketed in Norway and Australia.\n\n[4] Pepsi Max: A Pepsi Max Lime version was released in the United States in February 2010 under the name \"Pepsi Max Cease Fire\" It was introduced in the UK in late-2011. It was cross-promoted with a new flavor series of Doritos chips called \"3rd Degree Burn\". In July 2010, Pepsi began to move its North American branding for Pepsi Max to match its global branding. It now carries a Max typography similar to that used worldwide, and rolled out a new slogan: \"Zero Calories. Maximum Pepsi Taste\". Its formula has not changed. In May 2011, Pepsi introduced the drink to Spain. In 2016, the drink was introduced to Venezuela. In 2017 Pepsi Max was launched in Costa Rica\n\n[5] Diet Pepsi: Diet Pepsi competed primarily with The Coca-Cola Company's Tab in the 1960s and 1970s; however, The Coca-Cola Company introduced Diet Coke in 1982 which has since been the principal competing product to Diet Pepsi. As of 2010, Diet Pepsi represented a 5.3 percent share of all carbonated soft drink sales in the United States, and was ranked as the #7 soft drink brand by volume. In the same year, Diet Coke was recorded as having a 9.9 percent market share.\n\n[6] Diet Pepsi: Diet Pepsi is a no-calorie carbonated cola soft drink produced by PepsiCo, introduced in 1964 as a variant of Pepsi with no sugar. First test marketed in 1963 under the name Patio Diet Cola, it was re-branded as \"Diet Pepsi\" the following year, becoming the first diet cola to be distributed on a national scale in the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s its competition consisted of Tab, produced by The Coca-Cola Company, and Diet Rite soda, produced by Royal Crown. Diet Coke was a later entrant to the diet cola market; though shortly after entering production in 1982 it became the primary competing diet cola to Diet Pepsi.\n\n[7] PepsiCo: The recipe for the soft drink Pepsi was first developed in the 1880s by Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist and industrialist from New Bern, North Carolina. He coined the name \"Pepsi-Cola\" in 1898. As the cola developed in popularity, he created the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902 and registered a patent for his recipe in 1903. The Pepsi-Cola Company was first incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1919. The company went bankrupt in 1931 and on June 8 of that year, the trademark and syrup recipe were purchased by Charles Guth, who owned a syrup manufacturing business in Baltimore. Guth was also the president of Loft, Incorporated, a leading candy manufacturer, and he used the company's labs and chemists to reformulate the syrup. He further contracted to stock the soda in Loft's large chain of candy shops and restaurants, which were known for their soda fountains, used Loft resources to promote Pepsi, and moved the soda company to a location close by Loft's own facilities in New York City. In 1935, the shareholders of Loft sued Guth for his 91% stake of Pepsi-Cola Company in the landmark case \"Guth v. Loft Inc.\" Loft won the suit and on May 29, 1941 formally absorbed Pepsi into Loft, which was then re-branded as Pepsi-Cola Company that same year. Loft restaurants and candy stores were spun off at this time. In the early 1960s, Pepsi-Cola's product lines expanded with the creation of Diet Pepsi and purchase of Mountain Dew.\n\n[8] Pepsi Generation: The Pepsi Generation was the theme of an advertising campaign for Pepsi-Cola, a U.S. brand of soft drink, that launched in 1963 as the result of a slogan contest. A new car was awarded to the writer of the winning slogan. The contest was the brainchild of Alan Pottasch, a Pepsico advertising executive, and it was won by Appleton, Wisconsin resident, Ellen M. Reimer. Her slogan invited consumers to \"Come Alive! You're the Pepsi Generation!\" The original \"Come Alive\" jingle was performed by singer Joanie Sommers in her memorable \"breathy\" vocal style.\n\n[9] Pepsi-Cola Made with Real Sugar: The Pepsi-Cola Made with Real Sugar, formerly called Throwback, is a brand of soft drink sold by PepsiCo in the United States and in sweet stores in South Australia for its flagship Pepsi and Mountain Dew brands. The drinks, called Pepsi Throwback and Mountain Dew Throwback, are named as such because they are flavored with cane sugar and beet sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, which soft drink companies used to replace sugar (in their North American products) in the 1980s. In addition, these drinks use retro packaging. As of June 2014, Pepsi Throwback has been replaced in one area of the United States by \"Pepsi-Cola Made with Real Sugar\", a new product formulation, also made without high fructose corn syrup.\n\n[10] Crystal Pepsi: Crystal Pepsi is a soft drink made by PepsiCo. It was first sold in Europe in the early 1990s. The United States and Canada received it from 1992 to 1994, with brief rereleases throughout the mid-2010s. It was briefly sold in the UK and Australia. The product's original market life was sabotaged by competitor Coca-Cola, in a \"kamikaze\" plan which sacrificed its Tab Clear product in order to end them both. Crystal Pepsi is notable for a fanatical revival by the public decades later, leading to a corporate response with these re-releases.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The crash was attributed to several factors, including market saturation in the number of game consoles and available games, and waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. Revenues peaked at around $3.2 billion in 1983, then fell to around $100 million by 1985 (a drop of almost 97 percent). The crash was a serious event which abruptly ended what is retrospectively considered the second generation of console video gaming in North America.\n\n[2] Video game crash of 1983: Lasting about two years, the crash shook the then-booming industry, and led to the bankruptcy of several companies producing home computers and video game consoles in the region. Analysts of the time expressed doubts about the long-term viability of video game consoles and software. The North American video game console industry eventually recovered a few years later, mostly due to the widespread success of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in ; Nintendo designed the NES as the Western branding for its Famicom console originally released in 1983 in order to avoid the missteps which caused the 1983 crash and avoid the stigma which video games had at that time.\n\n[3] History of video games: At the end of 1983, several factors, including a market flooded with poor-quality games, the commercial failure of several important Atari 2600 titles, and home computers emerging as a new and more advanced gaming platform, caused the industry to experience a severe downturn. This was the \"crash\" of the video game industry. It bankrupted several companies that produced North American consoles and games from late 1983 to early 1984. It ended what is considered to be the second generation of console video gaming.\n\n[4] 1982 in video gaming: 1982 was the peak year of arcade and console games during the Golden age of arcade video games. Troubles at Atari, Inc. late in the year triggered the North American video game crash of 1983. Many games were released that would spawn franchises, or at least sequels, including \"Dig Dug\", \"Pole Position\", \"Mr. Do!\", \"Pitfall!\", \"Q*bert\", and \"Xevious\". Additional consoles add to a crowded market. The new Commodore 64 goes on to eventually dominate the 8-bit home computer market.\n\n[5] History of Nintendo: In 1983-1985, a large scale recession in video game sales hit the market which amounted to a 97% decrease primarily in the North American area. The recession known as the \"video game crash of 1983\" was caused by a few main factors including the flooding of the console market, competition of home computers, inflation, and loss of publishing control. The video game crash of 1983 soon took out not only Atari, but the vast majority of the American market itself. Over time, dominance in the market shifted from America to Japan. Nintendo began exporting to America and had virtually only one major competitor in the market, Sega, which was another Japanese company.\n\n[6] Video gaming in the United States: The technological advances of the late '70s led to the introduction of the Intellivision in 1980, which featured better video game graphics but a higher price tag. In two years, the Commodore 64 changed the market by not only being the most powerful console of the time but also the cheapest. With the lowered prices, popularity of the video game industry continued to grow and the first video game magazine, \"Electronic Games\", was printed. This decade featured the start of 3D games and the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, Game Boy, Sega Genesis\", \"Atari 7800, and the lesser known TurboGrafx-16\", \"which featured games stored on compact discs. This time period was almost considered the second generation of console video gaming in the United States but a massive recession hit the industry from 1983 to 1985. This recession was called the North American video game crash of 1983.\n\n[7] Crash Nitro Kart: Crash Nitro Kart is a racing video game developed by Vicarious Visions and published by Universal Interactive. The Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox versions were released in North America on November 11, 2003 and in Europe on November 28, 2003; The N-Gage version of the game was released in Europe on June 30, 2004 and in North America on July 28, 2004. The Mobile version was released on September 20, 2004. The PlayStation 2 version was re-released in the three-disc \"Crash Bandicoot Action Pack\" compilation (alongside \"Crash Twinsanity\" and \"Crash Tag Team Racing\") in the United States on June 12, 2007 and in Europe on July 20, 2007. It was the last Crash Bandicoot game released under the Universal Interactive label, which parent company Vivendi Universal Games would scrap after the release of this game.\n\n[8] Video game crash of 1983: The North American video game crash had two long-lasting results. The first result was that dominance in the home console market shifted from the United States to Japan. By , three years after its introduction, 6.5 million Japanese homes—19% of the population—owned a Family Computer, and Nintendo began exporting it to the U.S.; by the Nintendo Entertainment System was very popular in North America. When the U.S. video game market recovered in the late 1980s the NES was by far the dominant console, leaving only a fraction of the market to a resurgent Atari. By 1989, home video game sales in the United States had reached $5 billion, surpassing the 1982 peak of $3 billion during the previous generation. A large majority of the market was controlled by Nintendo; it sold more than 35 million units in the United States, exceeding the sales of other consoles and personal computers by a considerable margin. Other Japanese companies also rivaled Nintendo's success in the United States, with Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis in 1989 and NEC's PC Engine/TurboGrafx 16 released the same year.\n\n[9] 1980s in video gaming: The second decade in the industry's history was decade of highs and lows for video games. The decade began amidst a boom in the arcade business with giants like Atari still dominating the market since the late-1970s. Another, the rising influence of the home computer, and a lack of quality in the games themselves lead to an implosion of the North American video game market that nearly destroyed the industry. It took home consoles years to recover from the crash, but Nintendo filled in the void with its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), reviving interest in consoles. Up until this point, most investors believed video games to be a fad that has since passed. In the remaining years of the decade, Sega ignites a console war with Nintendo, developers that have been affected by the crash experiment with the superior graphics of the PC, and Nintendo also releases the Game Boy, which would become the best-selling handheld gaming device for the next two-decades.\n\n[10] Crash Bandicoot (video game): By February 1999, 4.49 million copies of \"Crash Bandicoot\" had been shipped to retailers worldwide; the NPD Group reported sell-through of 1.45 million copies in North America alone by that time. PC Data tracked 771,809 domestic sales of \"Crash Bandicoot\" during 1998 alone, which drew $16 million in revenue and made it the firm's 10th-best-selling PlayStation release of the year. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \"Gold\" prize for revenues above €17 million in the European Union during the previous year. As of November 2003, \"Crash Bandicoot\" has sold over 6.8 million units worldwide, making it one of the best selling PlayStation video games of all time. The game's success lead to its inclusion for the Sony Greatest Hits. \"Crash Bandicoot\" was the first non-Japanese game to receive a \"Gold Prize\" in Japan for sales of over 500,000 units. The game spent nearly two years on the NPD TRSTS top 20 PlayStation sales charts before finally dropping off on September 1998.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is located on Arden Station Road just east of the New York State Thruway, and can easily be seen from the highway. It was built in 1854 by Robert & Peter Parrott, who also owned and operated numerous mines in the area, known collectively as the Greenwood Iron Works. Together with the Greenwood Furnace (c.1810), located roughly one half mile east of Clove, these two furnaces produced iron which supplied the Parrott's West Point Foundry at Cold Spring, NY. The foundry produced the famous and highly effective Parrott Rifle (cannon) utilized by the Union army during the Civil War. The furnace shut down permanently, shortly after Robert Parrott's death in 1877.\n\n[2] El Castillon: With this name we refer to the north corner of the village where two complex structures were found and identified as metallurgical furnaces, a forge or a metal workshop. A third furnace was discovered below the two first which gives us the idea that the area was consecutively used for the same purpose during a long period of time. The furnaces have an oval shape with a stony plinth and earthen dome made and destroyed during the melting process, a small hole in the plinth gave the access to the furnace. Within the area pieces of metalworking as nails, knives or tools and more than 50k of iron slag were found. Metallography analysis carried out by the Complutense University team of Mechanic Technologies and Archaeometallurgy (led by the professor Antonio J.Criado Portal and the technicians Laura Garcia Sanchez and Antonio Javier Criado Martín) we know that the furnaces obtained iron from melting the gangue by reduction. The extracting areas of the metal raw materials are close to the settmente because the analysis of metals from the nearby area revealed similitude with pieces of raw iron in the Sierra de la Culebra mountain range no more than 15 km North the site.\n\n[3] Sundown Tin and Copper Mine: The ruin of a furnace, taken to be the Merton Furnace for arsenic roasting, is located above the New Works area, and consists of a collapsed large brick furnace, built with \"Campbell\" fire bricks, with a horseshoe shaped flue leading from it. The flue, which is collapsed, was an above ground wide vault tunnel, and approximately the length referred to in the literature. The height could not be determined. At the other end of the flue from the furnace is a large brick pile and long plume of rubble consisting of a fallen chimney. The curve of the flue is supported on a platform built of stone, and a large number of iron pipes lay scattered in this area. There is slag underlying part of the furnace, and it may have been built on top of the first reverberatory furnace slag heap.\n\n[4] Clove Furnace Ruin: In 1973, these buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places. They are on Columbia University's Arden property, but open to the public occasionally as a museum.\n\n[5] Forest Dale Iron Furnace: The Forest Dale Iron Furnace was a 19th-century iron smelting facility in Brandon, Vermont. Located off Vermont Route 73 east of the village of Forest Dale, it operated between 1810 and 1855, closing due to competition from higher quality and more efficient furnaces. Now reduced to archaeological ruins and the remains of its main furnace stack, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The site is marked by a historic marker on Vermont 73.\n\n[6] Bonawe Iron Furnace: The Bonawe Iron Furnace (also called the Lorn Furnace), was an industrial complex located in Bonawe, Lorn District, Scotland. It operated in the middle of the eighteenth century, with the aim of producing pig iron. Central to this complex was a charcoal fired blast furnace.\n\n[7] Coonagh, Limerick City: Iron Age activity was revealed in the Eastern end of the excavation area, including the base of a small metal-working furnace cut into the gravel, and the fragment of a crucible (a vessel in which metal was melted before being poured into a mould). Analysis of the crucible indicate it was possibly used to manufacture 'leaded gunmetal', a copper and lead alloy. A possible whistle, or part of a set of pipes that were found, evokes images of social occasions and entertainment at the site. Age/slaughter patterns of animal remains found at the site indicate that the demand for meat took precedence over the demand for milk and other live animal products.\n\n[8] Pine Grove Iron Works: Pine Grove Furnace was built about 1770, the second of nine Cumberland County furnaces. It was built and operated by Robert Thornburg and John Arthur, in the interest of George Stevenson, who already owned Laurel Forge downstream on Mountain Creek. The furnace smelted iron ore to produce colonial cast iron products such as wagon wheel iron, fireplace backs, iron kettles, ten plate stoves, and in the late 19th century, Baldwin Locomotive parts.\n\n[9] Carrie Furnace: Carrie Furnace is a former blast furnace located along the Monongahela River in the Pittsburgh area industrial town of Swissvale, Pennsylvania, and it had formed a part of the Homestead Steel Works. The Carrie Furnaces were built in 1884 and they operated until 1982. During its peak, the site produced 1,000 to 1,250 tons of iron per day. All that is left of the site are furnaces #6 and #7, which operated from 1907 to 1978, along with the hot metal bridge. The furnaces, designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006, are among the only pre-World War II 20th century blast furnaces to survive.\n\n[10] Chalybeate Spring, Mittagong: In 2005-2006, remains of the Fitzroy Iron Works were uncovered prior to the construction of the Highland Marketplace shopping mall. These remains are now preserved within the carpark of the shopping mall. The focus of preservation and commemoration of the iron-works therefore moved to the north side of the Old Hume Highway, perhaps leaving the Mineral Springs Reserve with less justification for its existence.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

On 16 July 1916 he again met his lifelong friend, Captain Arthur Hastings, and solved the first of his cases to be published, \"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\". It is clear that Hastings and Poirot are already friends when they meet in Chapter 2 of the novel, as Hastings tells Cynthia that he has not seen him for \"some years\". Particulars such as the date of 1916 for the case and that Hastings had met Poirot in Belgium, are given in \"Curtain: Poirot's Last Case\", Chapter 1. After that case, Poirot apparently came to the attention of the British secret service and undertook cases for the British government, including foiling the attempted abduction of the Prime Minister. Readers were told that the British authorities had learned of Poirot's keen investigative ability from certain members of Belgium's royal family. After the war Poirot became a private detective and began undertaking civilian cases. He moved into what became both his home and work address, Flat 203 at 56B Whitehaven Mansions. Hastings first visits the flat when he returns to England in June 1935 from Argentina in \"The A.B.C. Murders\", Chapter 1. The TV programmes place this in Florin Court, Charterhouse Square, in the wrong part of London. According to Hastings, it was chosen by Poirot \"entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion\" and described as the \"newest type of service flat\". (The Florin Court building was actually built in 1936, decades after Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case in this period was \"The Affair at the Victory Ball\", which allowed Poirot to enter\n\n[2] Whitehaven (house): Whitehaven is a Clinton family-owned mansion in Washington, D.C. used by Hillary Clinton when she is in residence in the capital. (The primary Clinton home is in Chappaqua, New York.) Built in 1951, the Georgian-style house is located near Washington's Embassy Row. Notable past residents have included Sir David Muirhead, Henry Brandon and Muffie Cabot.\n\n[3] Whitehaven (house): Whitehaven, so-called as it is located on Whitehaven Street, is a brick Georgian-style mansion with white trim that sits on of property in the Massachusetts Avenue Heights neighborhood and is adjacent to the embassies of New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom, and within walking distance of Number One Observatory Circle, the official residence of the Vice-President of the United States.\n\n[4] Stanley Williams: The third incident occurred at the Brookhaven Motel located at 10411 South Vermont Avenue in South Central Los Angeles, which was run by  76-year-old Yen-Yi Yang and his wife, 63-year old Tsai-Shai C. Yang, their daughter, 43-year-old Yu-Chin Yang Lin, and their son, Robert. The Yangs were immigrants from Taiwan, and Yu-Chin had recently joined them in the United States to run the hotel. According to the prosecutors, at approximately 5:00 a.m. on March 11, 1979, Williams entered the Brookhaven Motel lobby and then broke down the door that led to the private office. Inside the office, Williams shot and killed Yen-Yi, Tsai-Shai, and Yu-Chin, after which he emptied the cash register and fled the scene. Robert, asleep with his wife in their bedroom at the motel, was awakened by the sound of somebody breaking down the door to the motel's office. Shortly thereafter he heard a female scream, followed by gunshots. Robert entered the motel office and found that his mother, his sister, and his father had all been shot, and the cash register was empty. The forensic pathologist testified that Yen-Yi Yang suffered two close range shotgun wounds, one to his left arm and abdomen, and one to the lower left chest. Tsai-Shai also received two close range wounds, one to the tailbone, and the other to the front of the abdomen, entering at the navel. Yu-Chin Yang Lin was shot once in the upper left face area at a distance of a few feet. Witnesses testified that Williams referred to the victims in conversations with friends as \"Buddha-heads.\"\n\n[5] Playboy Mansion: The Playboy Mansion, also known as the Playboy Mansion West, is the former home of \"Playboy\" magazine founder Hugh Hefner, who lived there from 1974 until his death in 2017. Barbi Benton convinced Hefner to buy the home. Located in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California, near Beverly Hills, the mansion became famous during the 1970s through media reports of Hefner's lavish parties which were often attended by famous celebrities and socialites.\n\n[6] Convoy JW 56B: JW 56B departed Loch Ewe on 22 January 1944, ten days after the preceding convoy, JW 56A. It was accompanied by its local escort, the destroyer \"Wrestler\", a corvette, and two minesweepers, and the close escort of five warships.  On 26 January, the day JW 56A came under attack, the local escort departed, to be replaced by the ocean escort of six Home Fleet destroyers.  On 29 January the convoy came into the area where JW 56A had been attacked. Waiting there were the ten U-boats of wolfpack \"Isengrim\", re-inforced with five newcomers and re-organized as the group \"Werewolf\". At midday on 29 January JW 56B was sighted by \"U-956\" and reported, though \"U-956\" came under heavy attack when she was detected.  By the morning of 30 January the U-boats had assembled, but JW 56B had also been re-inforced, being joined by the ocean escort of JW 56A, seven destroyers led by \"Hardy\".  Six of the U-boats made contact, mounting a total of thirteen attacks during that day. They were unable to reach the merchant ships, but \"U-278\" hit \"Hardy\" with an acoustic torpedo. She was crippled and abandoned, to be sunk later by an attending destroyer.  In response \"U-314\" was destroyed by \"Whitehall\" and \"Meteor\".  Following this the \"Werewolf\" pack abandoned its assault, and JW 56B arrived at Kola three days later, on 2 February.\n\n[7] Whitehaven, Memphis, Tennessee: Four high schools are in the Whitehaven area: Fairley High School, Hillcrest High School, Pathways In Education, and Whitehaven High School. Whitehaven High School was opened by 1911 and was the only high school in the community until Hillcrest opened during the 1960s. A strong rivalry developed between the two schools, and the Hillcrest/Whitehaven game became one of the major events in the community during football season. Bishop Byrne, a private co-educational Catholic high school adjacent to Saint Paul Church on Shelby Drive, opened in 1966 and closed in 2013. Whitehaven's major tourist attractions are still Graceland mansion and the annual Elvis Week, attracting many thousands there annually to remember \"The King\" on the anniversary of his death on August 16, 1977.\n\n[8] NoMad, Manhattan: New Yorkers began establishing residences around the park in the mid-nineteenth century. Private brownstone dwellings and mansions springing up around the perimeter of the park soon boasted such respected, well-to-do families as the Haights, Stokeses, Scheifflins, Wolfes, and Barlows. Leonard and Clara Jerome, the grandparents of Winston Churchill, lived at 41 East 26th Street. The Jerome Mansion later became the clubhouse of the Union League Club of New York (its second location), the University Club and, finally, the Manhattan Club, birthplace of the Manhattan cocktail and congregating place of such famous Democrats as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Grover Cleveland and Al Smith. The mansion was demolished in 1967 and was replaced in 1974 by the New York Merchandise Mart, which also extends onto the site of the adjacent Madison Square Hotel, where actors Henry Fonda and James Stewart roomed in the 1930s.\n\n[9] American Aeronautical Corporation: Thirty-six S-56s were built under ATC A-287, which was awarded on 4 January 1930. The S-56 became the first plane used by the New York City Police Department, which used it to enforce flying regulations, assist with sea rescues, and to chase rum-runners during the Prohibition era. A follow-up design, the S-56B, proved even more successful. ATC A-336, for the S-56B design, was awarded on 11 July 1930. The S-56B included a more powerful Kinner B-5 engine and sold for $7,825. Whereas the prices for the S-56 and S-56B were modest for the time, the Great Depression caused sales to drop significantly by 1933. Two original AAC S-56 planes exist today: one of which is on display at the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, New York.\n\n[10] Bruce Givner: Givner was a 21-year-old intern working at the DNC offices on the sixth floor of the Watergate office complex when his prolonged stay on that floor the night of June 16, 1972, precluded the group of \"bandits\" from entering the building to correct their earlier wiretap work. The criminals were set up across the street in a suite above the Howard Johnson's, while they waited for the lights to go out in the offices on the sixth floor at the DNC offices. Though Givner finished his intern duties around 7:30 p.m., he stayed to use a WATS line to call friends and family, both in Los Angeles and Ohio. Sometime during the middle of those calls, Givner needed to use the restroom. Realizing he could not re-enter the suites when using the bathroom in the hallway because he had no key to re-enter, Givner stepped out onto the balcony and relieved himself in a cement planter. (The Watergate burglars likely witnessed that event through binoculars as they lay in wait for the right time to make their move, which they finally did less than an hour after Givner left the building shortly after midnight.) That was long after the burglars had hoped to get in. That lengthy delay led to the arrest of the burglars, which opened the floodgates to the Watergate investigation, ultimately culminating in the impeachment proceedings against Nixon.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The first of these Ottoman viziers who was titled \"Grand Vizier\" was Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Elder. The purpose in instituting the title \"Grand Vizier\" was to distinguish the holder of the Sultan's seal from other viziers. The initially more frequently used title of \"vezir-i âzam\" () was gradually replaced by \"sadrazam\" (), both meaning \"grand vizier\" in practice. Throughout Ottoman history, the grand viziers have also been termed \"sadr-ı âlî\" (, \"high vizier\"), \"vekil-i mutlak\" (, \"absolute attorney\"), \"sâhib-i devlet\" (, \"holder of the State\"\"), \"serdar-ı ekrem\" (), \"serdar-ı azam\" () and \"zât-ı âsafî\" (, \"vizieral person\").\n\n[2] List of Ottoman Grand Viziers: During the nascent phases of the Ottoman state, \"Vizier\" was the only title used. The first of these Ottoman Viziers who was titled \"Grand Vizier\" was Çandarlı Kara Halil Hayreddin Pasha (also known as Çandarlı Halil Pasha the Elder). The purpose in instituting the title \"Grand Vizier\" was to distinguish the holder of the Sultan's seal from other viziers. The initially more frequently used title of \"vezir-i âzam\" was gradually replaced by \"sadrazam\", both meaning grand vizier in practice. Throughout Ottoman history, the grand viziers have also been termed \"sadr-ı âlî\" ('high vizier'), \"vekil-i mutlak\" ('absolute attorney'), \"sâhib-i devlet\" ('holder of the state'), \"serdar-ı ekrem\" ('gracious general'), \"serdar-ı azam\" ('grand general') and \"zât-ı âsafî\" ('vizieral person') and \"başnazır\", literally \"prime minister\" in Ottoman Turkish.\n\n[3] List of Ottoman Grand Viziers: The Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire ( or \"Sadr-ı Azam\" (\"Sadrazam\"); Ottoman Turkish: صدر اعظم or وزیر اعظم) was the \"de facto\" prime minister of the sultan in the Ottoman Empire, with absolute power of attorney and, in principle, dismissible only by the sultan himself in the classical period, before the Tanzimat reforms, or until the 1908 Revolution. He held the imperial seal and could convene all other viziers to attend to affairs of the state in the Imperial Council; the viziers in conference were called \"\"kubbe\" viziers\" in reference to their meeting place, the \"Kubbealtı\" ('under-the-dome') in Topkapı Palace. His offices were located at the Sublime Porte.\n\n[4] Sām: Sām (sam) (سام), also transliterated Saam, is a mythical hero of ancient Persia, and an important character in the Shahnameh epic. He was the son of Nariman, grandson of Garshasp and father to Zāl. He was Iran's champion during the rule of Fereydun, Manuchehr and Nowzar. He was appointed by Manuchehr to rule Zabulistan (Sistan), and then Mazandaran. After Manuchehr, because of Nowzar's corrupted and failed rulership, Iranian champions asked Sām to rule Iran. Sām didn't accept, he supported Nowzar and advised him to follow Fereydun and Manuchehr. Sām returned to Mazandaran, and died soon after that. Afrasiab then attacked Zabulistan.\n\n[5] Zahra Sadr-Azam Nouri: Zahra Sadr-Azam Nouri () is an Iranian reformist politician who currently serves as a member of the City Council of Tehran. In 1996, she was appointed by Gholamhossein Karbaschi as the mayor of Tehran's 7th municipal district, making her the first woman to hold office as mayor.\n\n[6] Haydar al-Sadr: Ayatollah Haydar al-Sadr () (1891–1937) was born in Samarra, Iraq. His father, Ismail as-Sadr (d. 1920) was a Grand Ayatollah and the first to be use the as-Sadr surname, which came to be associated with a long line of religious scholarship within Shia Islam. Haydar and the as-Sadr family are also considered as Sayyid, or those who can trace their lineage back to Muhammad (d. 632). The family's lineage is traced through Imam Jafar al-Sadiq and his son Imam Musa al-Kazim the sixth and seventh Shia Imams respectively. This direct and meticulously documented lineage is unprecedented even among the illustrious families in the Islamic world who claim such lineage. The Shia Muslims consider themselves the followers of Muhammad's bloodline, thus a great deal of respect and reverence is paid to the \"Sayyids\" throughout society. Some of the well known relatives of Haydar al-Sadr include his brother, Sadr al-Din Sadr (d. 1954), his nephew Moussa as-Sadr and another nephew Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr.\n\n[7] Sallar Deylami: Abu Ali Hamzeh Ibn Abdul Aziz, known as Sallar Deylami (died in 448 or 463 Lunar Hijrah) was a Shia Jurist and religious scholar during the fifth lunar hijrah. He was born in the last half of fourth lunar hijrah, in Deylaman. He was the candidate of Shaykh Mufid and Sharif al-Murtaza in the affairs of teaching and education. He was versed in different disciplines and subjects but his dominance in fiqh is more prevalent. He is considered to be an eminent pupil of Shaykh Mufid and Sayyed Murtaza. He is also considered to be an important religious scholar after the occultation of Imam Mahdi the twelfth Shia Imam. His title, Abu Ya'li, designates dignity and superiority. The name \"Sallar\" may be an Arabized form of the Persian \"Salar\".\n\n[8] Ahmad al-Hassan: Ahmad al-Hassan, full name Ahmad bin Ismail bin Saleh bin Hussain bin Salman (, born in Basra, Iraq) is the leader of the Shia Iraqi movement Ansar of Imam al-Mahdi who claims to be the savior of mankind. He started claiming to be the messenger of the messianic figure the Imam Mahdi, after he had a vision in which Imam Mahdi told him to enroll in the religious institute Hawza Ilmiya in Najaf, Iraq. Ahmad al-Hassan isolated himself at home to learn the sciences of the Hawza with an attempt of reforming it as he claims it to be disordered. He later formed a group called the Ansar. His followers believe him to be al-Yamani, the eschatological Yamani leader who will precede the return of the Imam due to his claim of being al-Yamani.\n\n[9] Mohammad Ali Keshavarz Sadr: Keshavarz Sadr was born into a landowning, aristocratic family. His father Seyyed Hossein Khan (Mirza Kouchek Khan) ‘Bahador ol-Molk’ was a landowner from Khomeyn, who owned several villages and estates around Mahallat and who served as a military commander in the constitutionalist army. His father was a stepbrother of Prime Minister Mohsen Sadr (Sadr ol-Ashraf II). His mother Mariam Keshavarz was his father's cousin. The couple also had another son named Ali Mohammad Keshavarz Sadr. From the marriage of his father with Haj Malek(eh) Khanoum Khajeh Nassiri (a cousin of Mohsen Sadr), Keshavarz Sadr had two half-sisters: Eghlim Sadat and Shazdeh Aqa Keshavarz (Sadr).\n\n[10] Kasr al-asnam al-jahiliyyah: Muhamrnad ibn Ibrahim ibn Yahya Oawarni Shirazi, entitled Sadr al-Din and also Mulla Sadra (in the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent simply Sadra) as well as Sadr al-muta'allihin, \"foremost among the theosophers\", or called simply Akhund by his disciples, was born in Shiraz in 979-980/1571-72 into an influential and well known family, his father having been the governor of the province of Fars. The date of his birth has not been specified in any of the traditional sources devoted to him 1and in fact it was discovered only a few years ago when'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei, a foremost contemporary sage or hakim of Iran, was correcting the new edition of the Asfar and preparing it for publication. On the margin of a manuscript copied in 1197/1703 but based on acopy autographed by Mulla Sadra and with certain marginal notes by the author himself, Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei discovered the following sentence in the section devoted to the question of the unity of the intellect and the intelligible: \"1 received this inspiration at the time of sunrise of Friday the seventh of Jumadi al-ula of the year 1037 A.H. [corresponding to January 14, 1628] when already 58 lunar years had passed from the life of the author.\"? Since then other sources have confirmed this information. But because it is not possible to know whether the58years is a period of between 57 and 58 years or 58 complete years, one cannot determine the exact date of his birth beyond setting it between the years 979/1571 and 980/1572.

It is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is contested annually between teams from competing countries in a knock-out format. It is described by the organisers as the \"World Cup of Tennis\", and the winners are referred to as the World Champion team. The competition began in 1900 as a challenge between Great Britain and the United States. By 2016, 135 nations entered teams into the competition. The most successful countries over the history of the tournament are the United States (winning 32 tournaments and finishing as runners-up 29 times) and Australia (winning 28 times, including four occasions with New Zealand as Australasia, and finishing as runners-up 19 times). The present champions are Croatia, who beat France to win their second title in 2018.\n\n[2] Dan Evans (tennis): Evans made his Davis Cup debut for Great Britain against Poland in September 2009. Evans twice won deciding fifth rubbers in matches from 2012 and 2013, against Slovakia and Russia respectively, helping Great Britain progress to the Davis Cup World Group. Evans also played in the Semi Final against Australia, losing both of his rubbers, and was a substitute for the Final against Belgium, with Great Britain winning the Davis Cup in 2015, the nation's first success in the tournament for 79 years. The Davis Cup team was awarded the 2015 BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.\n\n[3] Alex Olmedo: Perry T. Jones became Davis Cup Captain in 1958 and recruited Olmedo from Modesto Junior College to play on the team. He represented the U.S. in Davis Cup competition in 1958 and 1959, winning in both singles and doubles – achieving all 3 of the 3 points required to win the Cup in 1958 (two singles & one doubles). His teammates were Ham Richardson and Barry MacKay, when they won the Cup in 1958. Though he was not a U.S. citizen, he was technically eligible to represent the U.S. in Davis Cup because he had lived in the country for at least five years and because his country of citizenship, Peru, did not have a Davis Cup team. His participation was very controversial, however. Sports columnist Arthur Dailey at \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"This would seem to be the saddest day in the history of American tennis. A few more such rousing victories and the prestige of this country in tennis will sink to a new low.\" Olmedo himself refused to file for U.S. citizenship, said he was content to remain a Peruvian citizen, and denied he was ducking U.S. citizenship to avoid being drafted into the Army. Still, many Americans \"took a dim view of the largest nation in the competition stooping to borrow a little player from Peru to win the Cup\".\n\n[4] International Tennis Federation: The Davis Cup, named after its founder Dwight F. Davis, is an annual team event organized by the ITF (since 1979 when it replaced the Committee of Davis Cup Nations as event organiser) in men's tennis contested between teams from competing countries in a knock-out format. The first Davis Cup took place in 1900, prior to the formation of the ITF. Since 1981, the tournament has been divided into a 16-nation World Group, and zone groups (Americas; Europe/Africa; and Asia/Oceania) which compete in three or four tiers. Each year, successful teams are may be promoted up one level, while unsuccessful teams are relegated down one level. Davis Cup rounds are contested four times per year, scheduled to minimize disruption with the ATP Tour to encourage participation. In each round, a combination of singles and doubles matches are contested to determine the winners. In 2016, 135 nations participated, making it the largest annual international team competition in sport.\n\n[5] James Ward (tennis): Ward was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup in 2015, the nation's first success in the tournament for 79 years. He played in wins against the United States and France in the first round and quarterfinals, which included a crucial singles victory over US' John Isner to give Britain a 2–0 lead. Ward was also named in the team for the Davis Cup final, and the Davis Cup team won the 2015 BBC Sports Personality Team of the Year Award.\n\n[6] Dick Savitt: Savitt had played and won his three early 1951 Cup matches, winning 9 of 10 sets, en route to leading the American team into the championship round against Australia. Allison Danzig, the senior American tennis writer, called him America's best hope for victory. American Davis Cup coach Frank Shields, however, did not permit him to compete against the Aussies whom, only months earlier, he had dominated at Wimbledon and in Australia. He had trounced Australia's top seed Ken McGregor in three straight sets to win at Wimbledon, and won the Australian Singles championship, becoming the first non-Aussie to win that title in 13 years. He had also defeated Australia's best other player, Frank Sedgman, 6–3, 2–6, 6–3, 6–1 in the same tournament. Ted Schroeder, who had lost all three of his Davis Cup matches while losing 9 out of 10 sets in the process the year before and who was in semi-retirement, was chosen by Shield instead. Five of the top ten players in the U.S. publicly accused Shield of \"obvious prejudice\" in his choosing the team. Without Savitt playing singles, and with Schroder losing two of his three matches, the United States lost the 1951 Davis Cup to Australia.\n\n[7] List of Davis Cup champions: Sweden reached two more finals in 1988 and 1989 but lost both times to West Germany. The United States regained the title in 1990, but they lost 3–1 to France the following year. They regained the title a year later, but could not defend it in 1993 as Germany won. Sweden were victorious in 1994, and they won a further two Davis Cups in 1997 and 1998. Australia regained the Davis Cup in 1999, but they lost the following two finals to Spain and France respectively. Russia won their first Davis Cup in 2002, before Australia regained the title the following year. Spain won the tournament for the second time in 2004, and would win a further three titles in 2008, 2009 and 2011. The Czech Republic won successive Davis Cups in 2012 and 2013, before Switzerland won their first title in 2014. Great Britain won their first Davis Cup since 1936 when they beat Belgium 3–1.\n\n[8] Australia–England sports rivalries: The two teams, then known as Australasia and the British Isles, played off in the 1907 Davis Cup final. Australia would win the encounter 3-2 and in doing so captured their first ever Davis Cup title. The most recent Davis Cup meeting between the two nations took place at the 2015 Davis Cup semifinals. Great Britain, led by Scot Andy Murray, defeated Australia 3-2 in Glasgow and sealed their first finals appearance in 37 years. The Davis Cup ledger stands at 8-5 in Australia's favour.\n\n[9] John McEnroe: More than any other player in his era, McEnroe was responsible for reviving U.S. interest in the Davis Cup, which had been shunned by Jimmy Connors and other leading U.S. players, and had not seen a top U.S. player regularly compete since Arthur Ashe. Connors's refusal to play Davis Cup in lieu of lucrative exhibitions became a source of enmity between him and Ashe. In 1978, McEnroe won two singles rubbers in the final as the U.S. captured the cup for the first time since 1972, beating Great Britain in the final. McEnroe continued to be a mainstay of U.S. Davis Cup teams for the next 14 years and was part of U.S. winning teams in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1992. He set numerous U.S. Davis Cup records, including years played (12), ties (30), singles wins (41), and total wins in singles and doubles (59). He played both singles and doubles in 13 series, and he and Peter Fleming won 14 of 15 Davis Cup doubles matches together.\n\n[10] Dmitry Tursunov: In 2015 he won two men's doubles titles with different partners. As Tursunov's form started to improve and he came into calculation for selection in the Russia Davis Cup team, the problems he was having obtaining United States citizenship became apparent. He had attempted over several years' time to become a United States citizen, but the process has stalled and Tursunov travels with a Russian passport and an American visa. In his own words \"It's frustrating, but what can you do?\"\" \"In spite of this, Tursunov was selected for Russia in the Davis Cup semi final against Croatia and won his dead rubber match against Ivo Karlović. In 2006 in the first round tie against Netherlands, he won both his matches against Raemon Sluiter and Melle van Gemerden. He defeated Richard Gasquet in five sets in the fourth rubber of the quarterfinal; consequently sending the Russians into the semi-finals of the Davis Cup. For the second time in 2006, Tursunov sealed victory for Russia in the Davis Cup; this time in the semi-final where he defeated Andy Roddick of the United States in a match that lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes, ending 17–15 in the last set. By virtue of this victory, he earned Russia the spot in the Davis Cup final against Argentina, which took place in December. Despite, earning the winning match in the quarterfinals and semifinals, Tursunov only played doubles partnering with Marat Safin, which they won to give Russia a 2–1 lead. Marat Safin later sealed the 2006 Davis Cup win for Russia with his victory over José Acasuso.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is a non-fiction account of Rin Tin Tin. Blogcritics praised the depth of the book and wrote that \"It was fascinating to read about the 16 million animals deployed in World War I as scouts, messengers, carriers of medical supplies, and sentries. The insertion of the author’s personal reflections detracted from the more compelling story, but is a minor flaw in an otherwise extraordinary book.\" Alaska Dispatch put it in its \"20 new nonfiction reads for fall\", calling it \"a must-read book that is both an excellent piece of cultural history and a remarkable story of the animal-human bond.\"\n\n[2] Susan Orlean: In 1999, she co-wrote \"The Skinny: What Every Skinny Woman Knows About Dieting (And Won't Tell You!)\" under her married name, Susan Sistrom. Her previously published magazine stories have been compiled in two collections, \"The Bullfighter Checks Her Makeup: My Encounters with Extraordinary People\" and \"My Kind of Place: Travel Stories from a Woman Who's Been Everywhere\". She also served as editor for \"Best American Essays 2005\" and \"Best American Travel Writing 2007\". She contributed the Ohio chapter in \"State By State\" (2008). In 2011, she published a biographical history of the dog actor Rin Tin Tin, and October 2018 saw the release of \"The Library Book\", on the 1986 fire at the Central Library in the Los Angeles Public Library system.\n\n[3] Rin Tin Tin: On August 10, 1932, Rin Tin Tin died at Duncan's home on Club View Drive in Los Angeles. Duncan wrote about the death in his unpublished memoir: He heard Rin Tin Tin bark in a peculiar fashion so he went to see what was wrong. He found the dog lying on the ground, moments away from death. Newspapers across the nation carried obituaries. Magazine articles were written about his life, and a special Movietone News feature was shown to movie audiences. In the press, the death was given a wide variety of fabrications such as Rin Tin Tin dying on the set of the film \"Pride of the Legion\" (where Rin Tin Tin Jr. was working), dying at night, and dying at home on the front lawn in the arms of actress Jean Harlow, who lived on the same street. In a private ceremony, Duncan buried Rin Tin Tin in a bronze casket in his own backyard with a plain wooden cross to mark the location. Duncan was suffering the financial effects of the Great Depression and could not afford a finer burial, nor even his own expensive house. He sold his house and quietly arranged to have the dog's body returned to his country of birth for reburial in the Cimetière des Chiens et Autres Animaux Domestiques, the famous pet cemetery in the Parisian suburb of Asnières-sur-Seine.\n\n[4] Rin Tin Tin: After Duncan died in 1960, the screen property of Rin Tin Tin passed to TV producer Herbert B. \"Bert\" Leonard, who worked on further adaptations such as the 1988–1993 Canadian-made TV show \"Katts and Dog\" which was called \"Rin Tin Tin: K-9 Cop\" in the US and \"Rintintin Junior\" in France. After Leonard died in 2006, Leonard's lawyer James Tierney made the 2007 children's film \"Finding Rin Tin Tin\", an American–Bulgarian production based on Duncan's discovery of the dog in France. Meanwhile, a Rin Tin Tin memorabilia collection was being amassed by Texas resident Jannettia Propps Brodsgaard, who had purchased several direct descendant dogs from Duncan beginning with Rinty Tin Tin Brodsgaard in 1957. Brodsgaard bred the dogs to keep the bloodline. Brodsgaard's granddaughter, Daphne Hereford, continued to build on the tradition and bloodline of Rin Tin Tin from 1988 to 2011; she was the first to trademark the name Rin Tin Tin in 1993 (Duncan had never done so) and she bought the domain names rintintin.com and rintintin.net to establish a website. Hereford also opened a short-lived Rin Tin Tin museum in Latexo, Texas. Hereford passed the tradition to her daughter, Dorothy Yanchak, in 2011. The current Rin Tin Tin XII dog owned by Yanchak takes part in public events to represent the Rin Tin Tin legacy.\n\n[5] The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin: The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin is an American children's television program. Beginning in October 1954 until May 1959, 164 episodes originally aired on ABC television network. It starred Lee Aaker as Rusty, a boy orphaned in an Indian raid, who was being raised by the soldiers at a US Cavalry post known as \"Fort Apache\". He and his German shepherd dog, Rin Tin Tin, helped the soldiers to establish order in the American West. James E. Brown appeared as Lieutenant Ripley \"Rip\" Masters. Co-stars included Joe Sawyer and Rand Brooks.\n\n[6] Rin Tin Tin: Rin Tin Tin (often hyphenated as Rin-Tin-Tin; September 1918 – August 10, 1932) was a male German Shepherd that was an international star in motion pictures. He was rescued from a World War I battlefield by an American soldier, Lee Duncan, who nicknamed him \"Rinty\". Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin and obtained silent film work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box-office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star Strongheart, Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherd dogs as family pets. The immense profitability of his films contributed to the success of Warner Bros. studios and helped advance the career of Darryl F. Zanuck.\n\n[7] Jack L. Warner: The studio discovered a trained German Shepherd named Rin Tin Tin in 1923. The canine made his debut in \"Where the North Begins\", a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper. According to one biographer, Jack Warner's initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, \"who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics.\" Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio's most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound. Screenwriter Darryl F. Zanuck produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio's features. Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as Jack Warner's right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films. Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, Warner Bros. was unable to compete with Hollywood's \"Big Three\" – Paramount, Universal, and First National studios.\n\n[8] Rin Tin Tin: Rin Tin Tin's first starring role was in \"Where the North Begins\" (1923), playing alongside silent screen actress Claire Adams. This film was a huge success and has often been credited with saving Warner Bros. from bankruptcy. It was followed by 24 more screen appearances. Each of these films was very popular, making such a profit for Warner Bros. that Rin Tin Tin was called \"the mortgage lifter\" by studio insiders. A young screenwriter named Darryl F. Zanuck was involved in creating stories for Rin Tin Tin; the success of the films raised him to the position of respected film producer. In New York City, Mayor Jimmy Walker gave Rin Tin Tin a key to the city.\n\n[9] Theippan Maung Wa: Sein Tin went on to Christ Church of Oxford University to study for the Indian Civil Service exam and on his return from Britain in 1929, served as a district officer in rural Burma during the colonial period. He wrote a series of small sketches based on his observations of rural life, many of which were critical of political and economic institutions, both colonial and indigenous, such as the following examples.A collection of 36 of these short stories, published between 1929 and 1941 mostly in \"Ganda Lawka\", became prescribed school text in the 1960s published by Sarpay Beikman Books. His letters to \"Kyipwayay\" U Hla between 1933 and 1942 were published by the latter, subsequently known as Ludu U Hla, 3 decades later. U Hla also published \"Tint Tint Pyazat\" (Plays by Tint Tint); he had been instrumental in the search for and the eventual publication of \"Sit Atwin Neizin Hmattan\" (War Diary) in 1966.\n\n[10] Rin Tin Tin: Ten months after the break, the leg was healed and Rin Tin Tin was entered in a show for German Shepherd dogs in Los Angeles. Rin Tin Tin had learned to leap great heights. At the dog show while making a winning leap of , he was filmed by Duncan's acquaintance Charley Jones, who had just developed a slow-motion camera. Seeing his dog being filmed, Duncan became convinced Rin Tin Tin could become the next Strongheart, a successful film dog that lived in his own full-sized stucco bungalow with its own street address in the Hollywood Hills, separate from the mansion of his owners, who lived a block away next to Roy Rogers. Duncan later wrote, \"I was so excited over the motion-picture idea that I found myself thinking of it night and day.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The stadium is part of a complex that includes an arena known by the name of \"Maracanãzinho\", which means \"The Little Maracanã\" in Portuguese. Owned by the Rio de Janeiro state government, it is, as is the Maracanã neighborhood where it is located, named after the Rio Maracanã, a now canalized river in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n[2] 2007 Pan American Games: The Maracanã Stadium was built for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, the Mario Filho Stadium (internationally known as Maracanã) is one of the most famous stadiums in the world, receiving a great number of Brazilian and foreign tourists annually. The stadium staged the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football matches, including the finals. The Maracanãzinho Gymnasium is the house of the Rio 2007 volleyball competitions. The Julio Delamare Water Park is the stage for the water polo tournament in the Games. The Maracanã Sports Complex also includes the Celio de Barros Athletics Stadium, and it is administered by the Rio de Janeiro State Government.\n\n[3] Maracanã Village: Maracanã Village, also known as the Old Indian Museum, is an urban Indian village in the old building of the Indian Museum in the Maracanã neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. The building is near the Estadio Mario Filho, which is at risk of demolition by the state government of Rio de Janeiro state government. The controversy surrounding maintenance of the village fed popular political movements in the city, and the village is considered symbolic of opposition to the government of Sérgio Cabral Filho. Maracanã Stadium was the main stadium for the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Maracanã was the name of one of the four zones of the Olympic Village.\n\n[4] Rio de Janeiro: This region is home to the Maracanã stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity football venue, able to hold nearly 199,000 people, as it did for the World Cup final of 1950. More recently its capacity has been reduced to conform with modern safety regulations and the stadium has introduced seating for all fans. Currently undergoing reconstruction, it has now the capacity for 90,000; it will eventually hold around 80,000 people. Maracanã was the site for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and football competition of the 2007 Pan American Games; hosted the final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies and the football matches of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n[5] List of national stadiums: The largest and most well known stadium in Brazil is Estádio do Maracanã located at Rio de Janeiro. The Brazil national football team have most of their high-profile matches taken place in the Maracanã and the venue has hosted multiple World Cup and Copa America matches in its history including the two World Cup finals that Brazil has hosted (1950 and 2014).Prior to confederation into Canada, the Dominion of Newfoundland used King George V Park as its national stadium.\n\n[6] Maracanã, Rio de Janeiro: Maracanã (, which in Tupi–Guarani means \"green bird\") is a middle-class neighborhood in the Northern Zone of Rio de Janeiro city. The Maracanã Stadium is located in this neighborhood, as well as the Ginásio do Maracanãzinho. Maracanã is bordered by these neighborhoods: Praça da Bandeira, Tijuca and Vila Isabel.\n\n[7] Maracanã Stadium: The opening match of the stadium took place on 16 June 1950. Rio de Janeiro All-Stars beat São Paulo All-Stars 3–1; Didi became the player to score the first ever goal at the stadium. While the major part of the stadium was finished, it still looked like a construction site; it lacked toilet facilities and a press box. Brazilian officials claimed it could seat over 200,000 people, while the Guinness Book of World Records estimated it could seat 180,000 and other sources pegged capacity at 155,000. What is beyond dispute is that Maracanã overtook Hampden Park as the largest stadium in the world. Despite the stadium's unfinished state, FIFA allowed matches to be played at the venue, and on 24 June 1950, the first World Cup match took place, with 81,000 spectators in attendance.\n\n[8] Estadio Maracaná (Panama): Estadio Maracaná is a football stadium in Panama City, Panama. It was inaugurated in April 2014 and has a capacity of 5,500. It is the home stadium of Chorrillo F.C. and Club Deportivo Plaza Amador. It was named after the legendary Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\n[9] Maracanã Stadium: The total attendance at the last (and indeed decisive game, but not a final) game of the 1950 FIFA World Cup was \"199,854\", making it the world's largest stadium by capacity when it was inaugurated. After its 2010–13 renovation, the rebuilt stadium currently seats 78,838 spectators, making it the largest stadium in Brazil and the second in South America after Estadio Monumental in Peru. It was the main venue of the 2007 Pan American Games, hosting the football tournament and the opening and closing ceremonies. The Maracanã was partially rebuilt in preparation for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 World Cup, for which it hosted several matches, including the final. It also served as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, with the main track and field events taking place at the Estádio Olímpico.\n\n[10] Maracanã Stadium: Since the World Cup in 1950, Maracanã Stadium has mainly been used for club games involving four major football clubs in Rio— Vasco, Botafogo, Flamengo and Fluminense. The stadium has also hosted numerous domestic football cup finals, most notably the Copa do Brasil and the Campeonato Carioca. On 21 March 1954, a new official attendance record was set in the game between Brazil and Paraguay, after 183,513 spectators entered the stadium with a ticket and 194,603 (177,656 p.) in Fla-Flu (1963). In 1963, stadium authorities replaced the square goal posts with round ones, but it was still two years before the stadium would be fully completed. In 1965, 17 years after construction began, the stadium was finally finished. In September 1966, upon the death of Mário Rodrigues Filho, the Brazilian journalist, columnist, sports figure, and prominent campaigner who was largely responsible for the stadium originally being built, the administrators of the stadium renamed the stadium after him: \"Estádio Jornalista Mário Rodrigues Filho\". However, the nickname of \"Maracanã\" has continued to be used as the common referent. In 1969, Pelé scored the 1,000th goal of his career at Maracanã, against CR Vasco da Gama in front of 65,157 spectators.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The etymology of the name is probably from a P-Celtic source. Its modern usage is as a romantic or poetic name for Scotland as a whole, comparable with Hibernia for Ireland and Cambria for Wales.\n\n[2] Caledonia, Nova Scotia: The original settlers of Caledonia were six Scots and an Irishman, who settled on the seven hills in greater Caledonia. Caledonia was the Latin name given by the Romans to the area of modern-day Scotland, and with Nova Scotia translating as 'New Scotland', also from Latin, the names in the area obviously reflect this heritage.\n\n[3] Caledonia (typeface): Dwiggins chose the name \"Caledonia,\" the Roman name for Scotland, to express the face's basis on Scotch Roman typefaces. However, though Dwiggins began with the thought of copying the classical Scotch Romans, eventually he drew more inspiration from the Bulmer design of William Martin. The G is open and the R has a curved tail. the t is unbracketed. Italic characters p and q have no foot serif. The character set, as drawn by Dwiggins was wide, including ranging (old style) figures, lining figures, and small capitals in the text and bold weights. A Greek version of the face is available. Historian of printing G. Willem Ovink describes Caledonia as \"one of the most crisp and sprightly modern types\".\n\n[4] Caledonian: Caledonian is a geographical term used to refer to places, species, or items in or from Scotland, or particularly the Scottish Highlands. It derives from Caledonia, the Roman name for the area of modern Scotland. It is often abbreviated to \"Caley\", \"Cally\", or \"The Caley\", or — in Gaelic — \"An Calaidh\" (The Caley).\n\n[5] Caledonia, Minnesota: Caledonia was platted in 1854-1855. The town was named by founder Col. Samuel McPhail for the ancient Roman word for \"Scotland\". A post office has been in operation at Caledonia since 1855. Caledonia was incorporated in 1870, and was reincorporated in 1889.\n\n[6] Scotland during the Roman Empire: Little is known about this alliance of Iron Age tribes, which may have been augmented by fugitives from Roman rule further south. The exact location of \"Caledonia\" is unknown, and the boundaries are unlikely to have been fixed. The name itself is a Roman one, as used by Tacitus, Ptolemy, Pliny the Elder and Lucan, but the name by which the Caledonians referred to themselves is unknown. It is likely that the prior to the Roman invasions, political control in the region was highly decentralised and no evidence has emerged of any specific Caledonian military or political leadership.\n\n[7] Britannia: Britannia () has been used in several different senses. The name is a Latinisation of the native Brittonic word for the island, \"Pretanī\", which also produced the Greek form \"Prettanike\" or \"Brettaniai\", which originally, in the fourth to the first centuries BC, designated a collection of islands with individual names, including Albion or Britain. In Modern Welsh the name remains \"Prydain\". By the 1st century BC, Britannia came to be used for Great Britain specifically. After the Roman conquest in 43 AD, Britannia meant Roman Britain, a province covering the island south of Caledonia (roughly Scotland). When Roman Britain was divided into four provinces in 197 AD, two were called Britannia Superior and Britannia Inferior. Britannia is the name given to the female personification of the island, and it is a term still used to refer to the whole island.  In the 2nd century, Roman Britannia came to be personified as a goddess, armed with a trident and shield and wearing a Corinthian helmet. The name \"Britannia\" long survived the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th century and yielded the name for the island in most European and various other languages, including the English Britain and the modern Welsh \"Prydain\". After centuries of declining use, the Latin form was revived during the English Renaissance as a rhetorical evocation of a British national identity. Especially following the Acts of Union in 1707, which joined the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, the personification of the martial Britannia was used as an emblem of British maritime power and unity, most notably in \"Rule, Britannia!\".\n\n[8] Caledonia: The exact location of what the Romans called Caledonia in the early stages of Britannia is uncertain, and the boundaries are unlikely to have been fixed until the building of Hadrian's Wall. From then onwards, Caledonia stood to the north of the wall, and to the south was the Roman province of Britannia (consisting of most of what is now England and Wales). During the brief Roman military incursions into central and northern Scotland, the Scottish Lowlands were indeed absorbed into the province of Britannia, and the name was also used by the Romans, prior to their conquest of the southern and central parts of the island, to refer to the whole island of Great Britain.\n\n[9] New Caledonia (Canada): New Caledonia was a fur-trading district of the Hudson's Bay Company that comprised the territory of the north-central portions of present-day British Columbia, Canada. Though not a British colony, New Caledonia was part of the British claim to North America. Its administrative centre was Fort St. James. The rest of what is now mainland British Columbia was called the Columbia Department by the British, and the Oregon Country by the Americans. Even before the partition of the Columbia Department by the Oregon Treaty in 1846, New Caledonia was often used to describe anywhere on the mainland not in the Columbia Department, such as Fort Langley in the Fraser Valley.\n\n[10] British people: By 50 BC Greek geographers were using equivalents of \"Prettanikē\" as a collective name for the British Isles. However, with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term \"Britannia\" was used for the island of Great Britain, and later Roman-occupied Britain south of Caledonia, although the people of Caledonia and the north were also the self same Britons during the Roman period, the Gaels arriving four centuries later. Following the end of Roman rule in Britain, the island of Great Britain was left open to invasion by pagan, seafaring warriors such as Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons and Jutes from Continental Europe, who gained control in areas around the south east, and to Middle Irish-speaking people migrating from what is today Northern Ireland to the north of Great Britain (modern Scotland), founding Gaelic kingdoms such as Dál Riata and Alba, which would eventually subsume the native Brittonic and Pictish kingdoms and become Scotland.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Chemical waste may fall under regulations such as COSHH in the United Kingdom, or the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), as well as state and local regulations also regulate chemical use and disposal. Chemical waste may or may not be classed as hazardous waste. A chemical hazardous waste is a solid, liquid, or gaseous material that displays either a “Hazardous Characteristic” or is specifically “listed” by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, Corrosivity, Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed. Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.\n\n[2] California Green Chemistry Initiative: Society historically managed its industrial and municipal wastes by disposal or incineration. Chemical regulation occurs only after a product is identified as hazardous. This problem-specific approach has led to the release of thousands of potentially harmful chemicals in our environment. Chemical regulation is a continuous game of catch up, in which banned chemicals are replaced with new chemicals that may be just as or more toxic. Many environmental laws are still based on the industrial production model of cradle-to-grave. The term “cradle-to-grave” is used to describe and assess the life-cycle of products, from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal. This traditional approach to chemicals management has serious environmental drawbacks because it does not consider what happens to a product after it is disposed of. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976, exemplifies a cradle-to-grave management approach of hazardous waste. RCRA has been largely ineffective because its emphasis is on dealing with waste after it has been created; meanwhile emphasis on waste reduction is minimal. Waste does not disappear, it is simply transported elsewhere. Costly and burdensome hazardous waste disposal in the US has encouraged the exportation of hazardous waste to poor counties and developing nations willing to accept the waste for a fee.\n\n[3] Wastewater: Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrients, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above). Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Such chemicals are also liable to be broken down using strong oxidizing agents and these chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant. Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of oxidizable pollutants.\n\n[4] Biomedical waste: Biomedical waste is distinct from normal trash or general waste, and differs from other types of hazardous waste, such as chemical, radioactive, universal or industrial waste. Medical facilities generate waste hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. While such wastes are normally not infectious, they require proper disposal. Some wastes are considered \"multihazardous,\" such as tissue samples preserved in formalin.\n\n[5] Solid waste policy in the United States: Solid waste means any garbage or refuse, sludge from a wastewater treatment plant, water supply treatment plant, or an air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid, liquid, semi-solid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities. Solid waste does not include solid or dissolved materials in domestic sewage, solid or dissolved materials in irrigation return flows, or industrial discharges. The large scope of the term \"solid waste\" means that it must be managed in a variety of different ways and that various levels of government employ different policy instruments in order to accomplish this task.\n\n[6] Toyota Production System: The underlying principles, called the Toyota Way, have been outlined by Toyota as follows: External observers have summarized the principles of the Toyota Way as:The Toyota production system has been compared to squeezing water from a dry towel. What this means is that it is a system for thorough waste elimination. Here, waste refers to anything which does not advance the process, everything that does not increase added value. Many people settle for eliminating the waste that everyone recognizes as waste. But much remains that simply has not yet been recognized as waste or that people are willing to tolerate.\n\n[7] Hazardous waste in the United States: In California, waste oil and materials that contain or are contaminated with waste oil are usually regulated as hazardous wastes if they meet the definition of \"Used Oil\" even if they do not exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste. The term \"used oil\" is a legal term which means any oil that has been refined from crude oil, or any synthetic oil that has been used and, as a result of use, is contaminated with physical or chemical impurities. Other materials that contain or are contaminated with used oil may also be subject to regulation as \"used oil\" under Part 279 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Standards for the Management of Used Oil\n\n[8] Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976: Contrary to what the name implies, TSCA does not separate chemicals into categories of toxic and non-toxic. Rather it prohibits the manufacture or importation of chemicals that are not on the TSCA Inventory or subject to one of many exemptions. Chemicals listed on the TSCA inventory are referred to as \"existing chemicals\", while chemicals not listed are referred to as new chemicals. The TSCA defines the term \"chemical substance\" as \"any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including any combination of these substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature, and any element or uncombined radical\". Generally, manufacturers must submit premanufacturing notification to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prior to manufacturing or importing new chemicals for commerce. Exceptions include foods, food additives, drugs, cosmetics or devices regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, pesticides regulated by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, tobacco and tobacco products regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, substances used only in small quantities for research and development under Section 5(h)(3), and radioactive materials and wastes regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The EPA reviews new chemical notifications and if it finds an \"unreasonable risk to human health or the environment,\" it may regulate the substance from limiting uses or production volume to outright banning it. In 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act was the first major overhaul in many years.\n\n[9] Chemical waste: Another issue regarding chemical waste is the potential risk of surface and groundwater contamination by the heavy metals and radionuclides leached from uranium waste-rock piles (UWRP) A Radionuclide is an atom that has excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. Uranium waste-rock piles refers to Uranium mining, which is the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. An example of such threats is in Saskatchewan, Uranium mining and ore processing (milling) can pose a threat to the environment. In open pit mining, large amounts of materials are excavated and disposed off in waste-rock piles. Waste-rock piles from the Uranium mining industry can contain several heavy metals and contaminants that may become mobile under certain conditions. Environmental contaminants may include acid mine drainage, higher concentrations of radionuclides, and non-radioactive metals/metalloids (i.e. As, Mo, Ni, Cu, Zn).\n\n[10] Alkali Lake Chemical Waste Dump: Beginning in February 1969, Chemical Waste Storage and Disposition, a Beaverton company, stored roughly 25,000 55-gallon drums of chemical waste near the shore of the playa with a permit from the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The drums contained pesticides including 2,4-D and MCPA herbicide residue containing chlorophenols, polymeric chlorophenoxyphenols and dioxins/furans (including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin); metallic chloride waste, and paints and paint solvent. Chemical Waste Storage was contracted for waste disposal by the Chipman division of Rhodia, a Portland herbicide manufacturer, and by Oregon Metallurgical Corporation, a titanium producer. Further shipments were prohibited in 1971, due to improper waste handling practices. The State of Oregon took over the site in 1974, after losing legal actions against Chemical Waste Storage to force their compliance with new hazardous waste laws. First the Circuit Court and then the Court of Appeals determined that the company was financially unable to comply with the new regulations and that the State was to some extent complicit. In 1976, at a cost of $84,000, the state used bulldozers to push, crush and compact the leaking barrels into a dozen shallow, unlined, 400' long trenches, then covered them with soil.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat was the first credit card?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Joseph P. Williams: Diners Club, the first major travel and entertainment charge card, had been introduced in 1950, and American Express and Carte Blanche followed in 1958, but all of these offerings had to have bills repaid in 30 days and were accepted by a limited number of vendors. By the mid-1950s, Williams was the senior vice president in charge of a group that had the unofficial task of creating the nation's first all-purpose credit card. Studying previous failures and analyzing the successes by Sears, Roebuck and Company and Mobil in offering credit to their customers, the team led by Williams conceived of a set of features — an 18% interest rate applied after a 25-day grace period, credit limits and floor limits — that became the standards for the credit card industry since.\n\n[2] First National Bank of Omaha: In 1953, First National's consumer finance operation launched its \"First Charge\" card which remains to this day the most profitable innovation in First National's long history. The bank issued a simple little card, which was nothing more than a white piece of plasticized paper, complete with a green logo, and an inscription which spelled \"First Charge Account Service\" and a red number which served to identify the cardholder. First Bankcard is one of the top three banks serving the credit card needs of other financial institutions, including Union Bank of California and People's Bank. First Bankcard also services credit cards for Major League Lacrosse, World of Warcraft, Scheels All Sports, just to name a few. SunTrust Bank announced on December 12, 2006, that it has signed an agreement with Atlanta-based InfiCorp Holdings, Inc. (subsidiary of First National of Nebraska) for issuing consumer credit cards. Under terms of the agreement, InfiCorp will market, originate and service SunTrust-branded cards starting in the first quarter of 2007, focusing on SunTrust clients.\n\n[3] Rail Travel Card: Jan. 27, 1947 the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) introduced the first railroad credit card in the United States. By late February 1947 the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (KATY) introduced its own credit card, which it also claimed as being the first. Beginning in 1954 the New Haven Railroad offered its own credit card, the New Haven Railroad Rail Charge Card. It continued to be honored until the New Haven merged with the Penn Central Jan. 1, 1969. It may have been honored for a brief period by the Penn Central after the merger; subsequently they shifted over to accepting the Rail Travel Card. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) also introduced its own credit card in 1954.\n\n[4] Randi Altschul: In November 1999 Altschul teamed up with Lee Volte. Volte had been the Senior Vice President of Research and Development at Tyco. Altschul and Volte obtained several patents for what would be the world's first disposable mobile phone. Their intellectual property also included the trademark \"Phone-Card-Phone\". The new device was a phone that was of a size similar to an existing phone card. The credit card sized device was less than five millimetres thick, and was not made from plastic or metal, but from materials based on recycled paper. The phone incorporated a magnetic strip which meant that credit card companies could store identification which would allow the phone owner to make purchases. The phone was intended to sell at about twenty dollars, and the purchaser would be able to make phone calls totaling up to an hour. The phone was sold as disposable, but it could also be recycled; people who returned their used phones would receive a credit of two to three dollars. Frost & Sullivan, declared the Phone-Card-Phone to be the 2002 Product of the Year.\n\n[5] Visa Inc.: In mid-September 1958, Bank of America (BofA) launched its BankAmericard credit card program in Fresno, California, with an initial mass mailing (or \"drop\", as they came to be called) of 60,000 unsolicited credit cards. The original idea was the brainchild of BofA's in-house product development think tank, the Customer Services Research Group, and its leader, Joseph P. Williams. Williams convinced senior BofA executives in 1956 to let him pursue what became the world's first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards (actual working cards, not mere applications) to a large population.\n\n[6] Choice (credit card): It was also said that Citibank's owner, Citicorp, was not willing to accept the eventual estimated costs of establishing another national credit card, after Sears had spent an estimated USD$80 million creating its Discover Card. Its fate was similar to that of Citibank's first credit card, the \"First National City Charge Service\" (or \"The Everything Card\"), introduced on the East Coast in 1967 to compete with BankAmericard (today's Visa) but which became part of Master Charge (now MasterCard) in 1969.\n\n[7] Bank of Baroda: Bobcards Ltd is a credit card company, 100% subsidiary of Bank of Baroda. The company is in the business of Credit cards, Acquiring Business & back end support for Debit cards operations to Bank of Baroda. Bank of Baroda had introduced its first charged card named BOBCARD in the year 1984. The whole operation of this plastic card was managed by Credit card division of Bank of Baroda. It established a wholly owned subsidiary, Bobcards Limited in the year 1994 to cater to the need of rapidly growing credit card industry in a focused manner. BOBCARDS Ltd is the first Non-banking company in India issuing credit cards\n\n[8] Barclaycard: Barclaycard was launched on 29 June 1966, initially as a charge card, but following Bank of England agreement to the offering of revolving credit it became the first credit card in the United Kingdom on 8 November 1967. It enjoyed a monopoly of the credit card market in the United Kingdom, until the introduction of the Access card in 1972.\n\n[9] Citibank: In the 1960s the bank entered into the credit card business. In 1965, First National City Bank bought Carte Blanche from Hilton Hotels. Three years later, the bank (under pressure from the U.S. government) sold this division. By 1968, the company created its own credit card. The card, known as \"The Everything Card\", was promoted as a kind of East Coast version of the BankAmericard. By 1969, First National City Bank decided that the Everything Card was too costly to promote as an independent brand and joined Master Charge (now MasterCard). Citibank unsuccessfully tried again from 1977 to 1987 to create a separate credit card brand, the Choice Card.\n\n[10] EMV: In 2010, a number of companies began issuing pre-paid debit cards that incorporate Chip and PIN and allow Americans to load cash as euros or pound sterling. United Nations Federal Credit Union was the first United States issuer to offer Chip and PIN credit cards. In May 2010, a press release from Gemalto (a global EMV card producer) indicated that United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York would become the first EMV card issuer in the United States, offering an EMV Visa credit card to its customers. JPMorgan was the first major bank to introduce a card with EMV technology, namely its Palladium card, in mid-2012.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The sector roughly follows the valley of the Crusnes river. Crucially, the trace of the Maginot Line in the Crusnes sector is about \"behind\" the industrial city of Longwy which sits directly against the French borders with Belgium and Luxembourg. The Crusnes sector was one of the strongest Maginot Line sectors. It was attacked in 1940 by German forces in the Battle of France. Despite the withdrawal of the mobile forces that supported the fixed fortifications, the sector successfully fended off German assaults before the Second Armistice at Compiègne. The positions and their garrisons finally surrendered on 27 June 1940. Following the war many positions were reactivated for use during the Cold War. Three locations are now preserved and open to the public, with a fourth position under restoration.\n\n[2] Fortified Sector of the Crusnes: The Crusnes sector was part of the larger Fortified Region of Metz, a strongly defended area between the Ardennes to the west and the Sarre valley to the east. The Metz region was more important during the planning and construction phase of the Maginot Line than it was in the operational phase of the Line, when the sectors assumed prominence. The Fortified Region of Metz was dissolved as a military organization on 18 March 1940. The SF (\"Secteur Fortifiée\") Crusnes was itself dissolved in 1940, becoming the 42nd Fortress Corps (\"42e Corps d'Armee de Forteresse (CAF)\").\n\n[3] Fortified Sector of the Crusnes: Following World War II, the French military reclaimed the Maginot Line with the aim of renovating and improving it against a possible attack by Warsaw Pact forces. The strongest positions, Fermont and Latiremont, were designated the \"môle de Crusnes\" (\"breakwater\") in 1951 and were placed back into service after a period of rehabilitation. Bréhain received much the same treatment, but was attached to the \"môle de Rochonvillers\" farther east. Lesser positions, such as Mauvais-Bois, Bois-du-Four and Aumetz, were repaired and kept as government property, but were not formally designated as places of defense. After the establishment of the French nuclear strike force, the importance of the Line declined, and maintenance ceased in the 1970s, with most of the casemates and \"petit ouvrages\" sold to the public.\n\n[4] Fortified Sector of the Escaut: The Fortified Sector of the Escaut (\"Secteur Fortifié de l'Escaut\"), also known as the Fortified Sector of the Schelde, was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the Maginot Line between the French border with Belgium and Valenciennes, a distance of about . Named for the Escaut River (more commonly known as the Schelde), the Maginot line in the Escaut sector consists of a single position, the \"petit ouvrage\" Eth, together with its supporting casemate Jeanlain, as well as an upgraded fort of the Séré de Rivières system, the Fort de Maulde. The remainder of the sector's fortifications consist of blockhouses and casemates arranged along a line of principal resistance about behind the frontier, with a second line on the edge of the Raismes Forest. The Escaut sector and the Fortified Sector of Maubeuge were the final sections of the Maginot line to be authorized, and were termed the \"New Fronts.\" The Escaut sector was attacked during the Battle of France in late May 1940, resisting for a few days.\n\n[5] Fortified Sector of the Sarre: The \"Région Fortifiée de la Sarre\" (\"Fortified Region of the Sarre\") was briefly created, encompassing the SF Sarre and the neighboring Fortified Sector of Rohrbach. The region existed for two months, in September and October 1939. Several transfers took place of sub-sectors to and from the neighboring SF Rohrbach and SF Faulquemont. In particular, Ouvrage Haut-Poirier was attached to Rohrbach at the time of its construction. Until 15 March 1940 the sector was called the \"Secteur Défensif de la Sarre\".\n\n[6] Fortified Sector of the Sarre: The Fortified Sector of the Sarre (\"Secteur Fortifié de la Sarre\") was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the Maginot Line on either side of the Sarre river. The sector's defenses relied primarily on a system of inundations that could be created by fortified dikes and regulating weirs, backed by blockhouses. Weakly defended compared with other sections of the Maginot Line, the sector received a measure of attention and funding from the mid-1930s when the formerly demilitarized Saarland was reintegrated into Germany. However, with a single \"petit ouvrage\" it remained a weak point in the Line. In 1940 the Sarre sector was attacked by German forces in the Battle of France. The inundations were only partly successful, and German forces were able to pierce the Maginot Line at the Sarre, allowing German divisions to move behind the main French line.\n\n[7] Fortified Sector of Mulhouse: The Fortified Sector of Mulhouse (\"Secteur Fortifié de Mulhouse\") was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the French frontier with Germany in the vicinity of Mulhouse. The sector's principal defense was the Rhine itself, which could be crossed only by boat or by seizing a bridge crossing. The sector's fortifications chiefly took the form of casemates and blockhouses. The sector did not see significant action during the Battle of France, since the German crossings of the Rhine took place further north, near Colmar. The fortifications in the sector were built as part of the overall plan for the Maginot Line, but did not include the major fortified positions that characterized the Maginot Line of northeastern France. The sector did not see significant fighting in World War II. It was bordered to the north by the Fortified Sector of Colmar and on the south by the Fortified Sector of Altkirch.\n\n[8] Fort de Tournoux: The Batterie du Clos des Caurres is even higher than Fort Supérieur, at and contains the main armament of the complex. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Séré de Rivières system fort was planned to mount six de Bange 155mm guns. The underground gallery linking to Fort Supérieur was completed between 1880 and 1883. The deep ditch around the position was completed in 1890, and from then until 1897 a wall was built connecting to Fort Supérieur. The position was manned by 656 men under 7 officers. Prior to World War I, efforts were made to provide concrete cover over critical areas, which were not completed in 1914. A casemate for two 75mm guns was built to cover the flank of the Vallon Claus battery, and the fort was re-armed with eight 95mm guns and four 120 mm guns. Other sources give an armament of four 75mm guns, four 155mm guns and three 81mm mortars.\n\n[9] Fortified Sector of Lille: The Fortified Sector of Lille (\"Secteur Fortifié de Lille\") was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the French border with Belgium opposite Lille. The sector was part of a system of fortifications that included the Maginot Line in other sectors. In the case of the Lille sector, no large fortifications of the kind typified by the Maginot Line were built in the area. Fortifications were confined to a total of 65 blockhouses and 23 infantry shelters within a few kilometers of the border, mainly between Roubaix and Tourcoing and the border. The Fortified Sector of Lille was bordered on the east by the Fortified Sector of the Escaut and on the west by the Fortified Sector of Flanders. The sector figured in the Pillbox affair of 1939-40. It was quickly overrun by German forces during the Battle of France.\n\n[10] Fortified Sector of the Vosges: The Fortified Sector of the Vosges (\"Secteur Fortifiée des Vosges\") was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the Maginot Line at the northern end of the Vosges Mountains in northeastern France. The sector was bordered to the west by the Fortified Sector of Rohrbach and to the east by the Fortified Sector of Haguenau. The sector featured two \"gros ouvrages\" mounting heavy artillery at either end of the sector and one \"petit ouvrage\" mounting infantry weapons, linked by a line of casemates. The sector was attacked in 1940 by German forces in the Battle of France. German forces penetrated the casemate line and moved behind French lines. Despite the withdrawal of the mobile forces that supported the fixed fortifications, the three \"ouvrages\" successfully fended off German assaults before the Second Armistice at Compiègne, but were unable to hinder German activities to their south. The positions and their garrisons finally surrendered on 1 July 1940. Following the war several positions were reactivated for use during the Cold War. One position, Ouvrage Four-à-Chaux, is open to the public and may be visited.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is located in the Misraqawi Zone at longitude and latitude , with an elevation of above sea level and below a high ridge to the west. Adigrat is the last important Ethiopian city south of the border with Eritrea, and is considered to be a strategically important gateway to Eritrea and the Red Sea. Adigrat was part of Ganta Afeshum woreda before a separate woreda was created for the city. Currently, Adigrat serves as the capital of the Eastern Tigray zone.\n\n[2] Adigrat: Adigrat is located along Ethiopian Highway 2, which connects the city with Addis Abeba and Mekelle. In Adigrat, Ethiopian Highway 2, turns off the main highway to the west in the direction of Adwa. To the north of Adigrat, Ethiopian Highway 20 connects the city to Kokobay and to Asmara in Eritrea.\n\n[3] Cathedral of the Holy Saviour, Adigrat: The Cathedral of the Holy Saviour (), also called Adigrat Cathedral, is a Catholic church located in Adigrat, Ethiopia. It is the main place of worship of the Ethiopian Catholic Church. The cathedral is the mother church of the Eparchy of Adigrat (\"Eparchia Adigratensis\"). It belonged to the archeparchy of Addis Ababa (\"Archieparchia Neanthopolitana\"), which was elevated to its current status in 1961 by Pope John XXIII through the bull \"Quod Venerabiles\".\n\n[4] Adigrat: Gunda Gunde is an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo monastery located to the south of Adigrat in the Misraqawi (Eastern) Zone of the northern Tigray Region in Ethiopia. It is known for its prolific scriptorium,as well as its library of Ge'ez manuscripts. This collection of over 220 volumes, all but one dating from before the 16th century, is one of the largest collections of its kind in Ethiopia.\n\n[5] Adigrat: Adigrat emerged as the political capital of Tigray when \"dejazmach\" Sabagadis Woldu of Agame assumed the governorship of the region in the period 1822-30. Sabagadis set up some palaces, churches and markets. This increasingly attracted both natives and foreigners to establish permanent residences and a few shops in the town. Adigrat was an important market-center for salt, which was mined in the Afar districts of Areho and Berale in eastern Tigray. However, it declined after the death of its patron, Sabagadis, in 1830. It was repeatedly attacked, sacked and plundered by the lowlanders and political rivals of Sabagadis. Samuel Gobat had joined countless Ethiopians in fleeing there for safety in the days immediately after Sabagadis' death.\n\n[6] Adigrat: Adigrat is one of the most important cities of Tigray, which evolved from earlier political centers and camps of regional governors. Antalo, Aläqot and Adigrat were a few of them. The decline of Antalo was followed by the rise of Adigrat as another prominent, yet short-lived, capital of Tigray. It used to serve as the capital of Agame.\n\n[7] Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat: The Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat () is a Catholic eparchy located in the city of Adigrat, Ethiopia. It is in the ecclesiastical province of Addis Ababa.\n\n[8] Adigrat: Surrounded by a range of mountains (the peak of which is Alaqwa), Adigrat held a strategic position at the junction of the crossroads between Adwa in the west, Asmara and Massawa in the north and Mekelle in the south. Towards the east, it is delimited by the spectacular edge of the north-eastern Ethiopian escarpment dropping into the lowlands. Adigrat was interconnected with the prominent trade routes linking Tigray and the Red Sea, on the one hand, and such old market-towns as Adwa, Hawzen, Antalo and Mekelle, on the other.\n\n[9] Adigrat: The Huga river runs through Adigrat. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river. Adigrat is located at altitude ranges from 2000 to 3000 m above sea level. The city has several prominent hills; one of the most prominent is Debre Damo which has a monastery at its peak.\n\n[10] Adigrat: Adigrat, the capital of the Agamé district, has a rich aristocratic and political history. In town are the remnants of two castles from the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of Princes\"),(ዘመነ መሳፍንት) one owned by Dej Desta, the other by the Ras Sebhat Aregawi.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the most significant side venture the popular firearms company, Remington, has pursued?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Remington Products: The origins of the \"Remington\" name date back to the formation of E. Remington and Sons, a firearms maker founded in 1816. E. Remington & Sons made occasional forays into products other than firearms, such as sewing machines and farm implements — but its most significant side venture was when inventor Christopher Sholes persuaded the firearms company to help him develop the typewriter with the QWERTY keyboard, which is still the standard today. In 1886, E. Remington & Sons sold the typewriter company, which became Remington Typewriter Company. This in turn merged with the Rand Kardex Corporation in 1927 to become Remington Rand. Remington Rand branched out into making adding machines, filing cabinets, punched card tabulating machines, and other office equipment to become a leading office equipment company.\n\n[2] Remington Arms: Remington Arms Company, LLC is an American manufacturer of firearms and ammunition in the United States. It was founded in 1816 by Eliphalet Remington in Ilion, New York, as E. Remington and Sons. Remington is America's oldest gun maker and is claimed to be America's oldest factory that still makes its original product.  Remington is the largest U.S. producer of shotguns and rifles. The company has developed or adopted more cartridges than any other gun maker or ammunition manufacturer in the world.\n\n[3] .35 Remington: Over the years, the .35 Remington has been chambered in a variety of rifles by most firearms manufacturers, and continues in popularity today in the Marlin Model 336 lever-action. It is also a popular cartridge for single-shot hunting pistols like the Thompson/Center Contender and the Remington XP-100. For hunters looking for a good woods gun, (\"i.e.\", a medium power rifle with moderate recoil, for short to medium ranges) the .35 Remington is popular, taking second place to the .30-30 Winchester. It has a small but loyal following in the northeast and areas of the southern United States.\n\n[4] Marlin Firearms: In November 2000, Marlin purchased the assets of H&R 1871, Inc., a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of shotguns and rifles (New England Firearms branded), founded in 1871, and now located in Gardner, Massachusetts. Marketing its products under the brand names of Harrington & Richardson and New England Firearms, H&R 1871 claimed to be the largest manufacturer of Single-shot shotguns and rifles in the world. In December 2007 Remington Arms Company purchased Marlin. Remington announced in April 2008 that it would close the Gardner manufacturing plant by the end of 2008 affecting 200 workers. In March 2010, Marlin announced that it would close its North Haven plant, and move the work to Remington plants in Ilion, New York, and Mayfield, Kentucky.\n\n[5] .44 Special: Elmer Keith, one of the most famous and popular firearms related authors at the time, developed a number of classical heavy handloads for the .44 Special; many are still highly regarded today. He also championed the concept of higher powered big-bore revolvers with Smith & Wesson and Remington Arms, eventually leading to the development of the .357, .41, and .44 Magnums. Keith's suggested designation for the proposed .44 caliber round was the \".44 Special Magnum,\" but when Remington Arms developed the cartridge they chose to name it the .44 Remington Magnum. Nonetheless, the new cartridge was developed directly from the .44 Special design by simply lengthening the older case by .125 inch. Remington's stated rationale for the making of this change was to preclude higher pressured Magnum loads from being chambered in .44 Special revolvers.\n\n[6] Remington Arms: In 1962 Remington introduced the Model 700 bolt-action rifle. The rifle became one of Remington's most successful firearms, and quickly lent itself to developments of many sub-variants, including the Remington 700 BDL, Remington 700PSS for police and law enforcement agencies (the rifle, later renamed 700P, is very popular among law enforcement agencies) and the military M24 SWS, which was the United States Army standard sniper rifle between 1988–2010. It is still used by other armed forces around the world, such as the IDF. Other firearms companies designed and manufactured sniper rifles based on the reliable and accurate Remington Model 700 action.\n\n[7] E. Remington and Sons: In 1839 Eliphalet was joined by his oldest son, Philo Remington (to make the business \"E. Remington & Son\"), and in 1845 his second son, Samuel, also joined the company, afterwards called \"E. Remington & Sons\". Remington's third son, Eliphalet III, would later join the company as well. During this period, the Remingtons specialized almost exclusively in the manufacture of rifle barrels. These barrels, marked with the distinctive \"REMINGTON\" stamp near their breeches, were recognized for their quality and reasonable price. Many, if not most, of the independent gunsmiths in the Mohawk Valley purchased completed (but not rifled) barrels from Remington and assembled them into firearms custom ordered by their customers. As demand increased, the Remingtons added other parts to their inventory, first percussion locks made in Birmingham, England but marked with their stamp \"REMINGTON\", and later sets of brass gun furniture, including trigger guards, butt plates, and patch boxes. After 1846, first martial longarm and then revolver production dominated the company's workforce.\n\n[8] Remington Model 760: Following World War II, many of Remington's pre-war firearms resumed production. This created a dilemma for the company as it had produced martial arms during the war. Production of military arms had forced manufacturers to streamline production and use more economical methods and materials that were not adaptable to most earlier designs. Remington set about creating families of firearms that shared a common design and parts. This trend began with the Model 11-48 and continues to this day. The Model 870 and 1100 shotguns share similar construction, styling, and share many parts with the Model 760 and 740 rifles.\n\n[9] E. Remington and Sons: Remington in addition was one of the most successful gun manufacturers in the world arms trade between 1867 and 1900, specifically through the export of the Remington Rolling Block action rifle. This single-shot, large-caliber black-powder cartridge rifle was exported in the millions all over the world, including shipments to France, Egypt, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Argentina, Mexico and the Papal States. It was an important gun supplier of small arms used by the United States government in World War I (U.S. involvement 1917 to 1918) and World War II (U.S. involvement 1941 to 1945)\n\n[10] .357 Remington Maximum: The .357 Maximum, formally known as the .357 Remington Maximum or the .357 Max, is a super magnum handgun cartridge originally developed by Elgin Gates as the wildcat .357 SuperMag. The .357 Maximum was introduced into commercial production as a joint-venture by Remington Arms Company and Ruger in 1983 as a new chambering for the Ruger Blackhawk. Shortly thereafter, Dan Wesson Firearms and Thompson/Center Arms introduced firearms in this cartridge. United Sporting Arms chambered it in their Silhouette series single-action revolvers. It is a .357 Magnum case lengthened . Based on the .357 Magnum cartridge, a revolver or single-shot pistol designed for the .357 Max can fire .357 Magnum, .38 Special, .38 Long Colt, and .38 Short Colt rounds. Intended primarily as a silhouette cartridge, such high velocity and energy levels have hunting applications. SAAMI pressure level for this cartridge is set at .  Despite good performance, the high pressure and velocity of the cartridge caused flame cutting of revolver top straps (due to the use of light bullets), and the cartridge has since been dropped by all manufacturers who so chambered their revolvers. Single shot pistols and rifles (e.g., Thompson/Center Contender) are still available in this caliber, and remain popular among handloaders. Unprimed brass is still produced every few years by Remington, and is also a stock item from Starline.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird and the fastest member of the animal kingdom with a diving speed of . The fastest animal in the sea is the black marlin, which has a recorded speed of .\n\n[2] Paratarsotomus macropalpis: The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second (). This is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle \"Cicindela eburneola\", the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land animal, which has been clocked at a peak of , scores at only 16 body lengths per second.\n\n[3] Fastest animals: While comparing between various classes of animals, a different unit is used, body length per second for organisms. The fastest organism on earth, relative to body length, is the South Californian mite \"Paratarsotomus macropalpis\", which has a speed of 322 body lengths per second. The equivalent speed for a human running as fast as this mite would be . This is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle, \"Cicindela eburneola\", the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16 body lengths per second while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate\n\n[4] Pronghorn: The pronghorn is the fastest land mammal in the Western Hemisphere, being built for maximum predator evasion through running. The top speed is very hard to measure accurately and varies between individuals; it can run 35 mph for 4 mi (56 km/h for 6 km), 42 mph for 1 mi (67 km/h for 1.6 km), and 55 mph for 0.5 mi (88.5 km/h for 0.8 km). It is often cited as the second-fastest land animal, second only to the cheetah. It can, however, sustain high speeds longer than cheetahs. University of Idaho zoologist John Byers has suggested the pronghorn evolved its running ability to escape from extinct predators such as the American cheetah, since its speed greatly exceeds that of extant North American predators. Compared to its body size, the pronghorn has a large windpipe, heart, and lungs to allow it to take in large amounts of air when running. Additionally, pronghorn hooves have two long, cushioned, pointed toes which help absorb shock when running at high speeds. They also have an extremely light bone structure and hollow hair. Pronghorns are built for speed, not for jumping. Their ranges are sometimes affected by sheep ranchers' fences. However, they can be seen going under fences, sometimes at high speed. For this reason, the Arizona Antelope Foundation and others are in the process of removing the bottom barbed wire from the fences, and/or installing a barbless bottom wire.\n\n[5] Thermoregulation: In April 2014, the South Californian mite \"Paratarsotomus macropalpis\" has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length, at a speed of 322 body lengths per second. Besides the unusually great speed of the mites, the researchers were surprised to find the mites running at such speeds on concrete at temperatures up to , which is significant because this temperature is well above the lethal limit for the majority of animal species. In addition, the mites are able to stop and change direction very quickly.\n\n[6] Petrified Forest National Park: Some of the larger animals roaming the grasslands include pronghorns, black-tailed jackrabbits (hares), Gunnison's prairie dogs, coyotes, bobcats and foxes. Pronghorns, the fastest land animals in North America, are capable of sprints. They are the second fastest land animal on Earth. The blood vessels in the huge, thin-walled ears of the jackrabbits act as heat exchangers. These hares are known for their bursts of speed, long leaps, and zigzag routes, all of which protect them from being eaten by golden eagles and other predators. The prairie dogs live in large colonies or \"towns\", near which many other species find food and shelter. Coyotes dine largely on rodents but also eat fruits, reptiles, insects, small mammals, birds, and carrion.\n\n[7] Paratarsotomus macropalpis: Paratarsotomus macropalpis is a species of mite belonging to the family Anystidae. The mite is endemic to Southern California and is usually observed darting amongst sidewalks and in rocky areas. Earlier classified as belonging to genus \"Tarsotomus\", it was reclassified in 1999, along with four other species, to genus \"Paratarsotomus\". It is quite small—0.7 mm—but has been recorded as the world's fastest land animal relative to body length.\n\n[8] What Is the Fastest Thing in the World?: A brother argue over how they should split their land, some of which was good and some bad. The king set riddles to them: whoever guessed the riddles would get good land. The first riddle was what was the fastest thing in the world. The stupid brother's daughter told him what to say; his brother guessed a bird or a horse, and the stupid brother said the mind. The second riddle was what was the heaviest thing in the world; the clever brother guessed stone or iron, and the stupid brother repeated his daughter's answer: fire because no one could lift it. The third was what was the most important thing in the world; the clever brother guessed bread or money, and the stupid brother repeated his daughter's answer: ground, because they needed it to stand on.\n\n[9] Fastest animals: This is a list of the fastest animals in the world, grouped by types of animal.\n\n[10] List of heaviest land mammals: The heaviest land mammal has a weight up to , the African bush elephant. This enormous mammal measures approximately , and eats of vegetation like grasses and leaves a day. Their two elongated teeth-tusks can grow continuously during their lives and reach about in length.

This basic structure is set out in Chapter V of the UN Charter. Security Council members must always be present at UN headquarters in New York so that the Security Council can meet at any time.\n\n[2] List of members of the United Nations Security Council: As of July 2011, there are currently 193 members of the United Nations and five permanent members of the Security Council. The other ten seats are assigned amongst the remaining 188 members. As a result, many members have never been on the Security Council. The following list is a summary of all countries, currently 68 modern nations and three historical ones, that have never been a member of the United Nations Security Council. The three historical UN members listed are Tanganyika, Zanzibar, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\n[3] Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council: The permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (also known as the Permanent Five, Big Five, or P5) are the five states which the UN Charter of 1945 grants a permanent seat on the UN Security Council: China (formerly the Republic of China), France, Russia (formerly the Soviet Union), the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries were all allies in World War II, which they won. They are also all nuclear weapons states. A total of 15 UN member states serve on the UNSC, the remainder of which are elected. Any one of the five permanent members have the power of veto, which enables them to prevent the adoption of any \"substantive\" draft Council resolution, regardless of its level of international support.\n\n[4] List of members of the United Nations Security Council: Membership of the United Nations Security Council is held by the five permanent members and ten elected, non-permanent members. Prior to 1966, there were six elected members, while the permanent members have in essence not changed since the creation of the United Nations in 1945, apart from the representation of China. Elected members hold their place on the Council for a two-year term, and half of these places are contested each year. To ensure geographical continuity, a certain number of members is allocated for each of the five UN regional groupings.In addition, one of the non-permanent members of the council is an Arab country, alternately from the African or Asia-Pacific groups. This rule was added to the system in 1967 for it to be applied beginning with 1968.\n\n[5] G4 nations: The UN currently has five permanent members with veto power in the Security Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States- comprising the victors of World War II. The G4 nations are regularly elected to two-year terms on the Security Council as non-permanent members by their respective regional groups: in the 24-year period from 1987 to 2010, Brazil and Japan were elected for five terms each, Germany for four terms (one term as West Germany and three terms as unified Germany) and India for four terms. Cumulatively, the G4 has spent 64 years on the Security Council since the UN's inception, with each country serving at least a decade. By comparison, the three permanent members of the Security Council who have maintained their seats since the UN's founding (France, the UK, and the US) have each accrued years of membership. The People's Republic of China has held its permanent seat for years, since it replaced the Republic of China in 1971, and Russia has held its permanent seat for years, since it replaced the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\n[6] List of members of the United Nations Security Council: This list contains the 130 United Nations member states so far elected to the United Nations Security Council, including the five permanent members, all listed by number of years each country has so far spent on the UNSC. Of all the members, 6 have so far ceased to exist, leaving the list with 124 modern nations. These, combined with the 69 modern nations that have never been elected to the UNSC to date (see Non-members, below), make up the entirety of the 193 current members of the UN.\n\n[7] United Nations Security Council: Along with the five permanent members, the Security Council of the United Nations has temporary members that hold their seats on a rotating basis by geographic region. Non-permanent members may be involved in global security briefings. In its first two decades, the Security Council had six non-permanent members, the first of which were Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Poland. In 1965, the number of non-permanent members was expanded to ten.\n\n[8] United Nations Security Council: The Security Council consists of fifteen members. The great powers that were the victors of World War II—the Soviet Union (now represented by Russia), the United Kingdom, France, China, and the United States—serve as the body's five permanent members. These permanent members can veto any substantive Security Council resolution, including those on the admission of new member states or candidates for Secretary-General. The Security Council also has 10 non-permanent members, elected on a regional basis to serve two-year terms. The body's presidency rotates monthly among its members.\n\n[9] United Nations: The Security Council is made up of fifteen member states, consisting of five permanent members—China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms by the General Assembly (with end of term date)—Bolivia (term ends 2018), Côte d'Ivoire (2019), Equatorial Guinea (2019), Ethiopia (2018), Kazakhstan (2018), Kuwait (2019), Netherlands (2018), Peru (2019), Poland (2019), and Sweden (2018). The five permanent members hold veto power over UN resolutions, allowing a permanent member to block adoption of a resolution, though not debate. The ten temporary seats are held for two-year terms, with five member states per year voted in by the General Assembly on a regional basis. The presidency of the Security Council rotates alphabetically each month.\n\n[10] Kazakhstan's membership in the United Nations Security Council: On June 28, 2016, at a vote at UN headquarters in New York, Kazakhstan, having won 138 votes out of 193 UN member states, for the first time was elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2017–2018. Kazakhstan's work in the UN Security Council began on January 1, 2017. Kazakhstan is the first state of Central Asia region that was elected to UN Security Council. As a non-permanent member of UN Security Council Kazakhstan pays a great attention to the regional challenges and the issue of Afghanistan, in particular such threats like terrorism growth, illegal drugs production, human trafficking, and also the presence of \"Islamic State\" and Al-Qaida. The UN Security Council is a standing body of the United Nations, which is entrusted with the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. The Security Council consists of 15 members, 5 of which are permanent (United Kingdom, China, Russia, United States, France), and 10 are non-permanent, elected by the UN General Assembly for a two-year period for 5 countries each year. In 2017, non-permanent members of the UN Security Council include Bolivia, Egypt, Italy, Kazakhstan, Senegal, Ukraine, Uruguay, Sweden, Ethiopia, Japan. Kazakhstan became a member of the UN on March 2, 1992. On April 15, 1992 Ms Akmaral Arystanbekova was appointed as the first Permanent Representative of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the United Nations by the decree of the President of Kazakhstan. On June 5, 1992 was signed the Presidential Decree on the establishment of the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the UN. On February 16, 1993, the UN Office in Kazakhstan was opened.

The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the stapes in the middle ear.\n\n[2] Skeleton: The human skeleton consists of both fused and individual bones supported and supplemented by ligaments, tendons, muscles and cartilage. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the brain, lungs, heart and spinal cord. Although the teeth do not consist of tissue commonly found in bones, the teeth are usually considered as members of the skeletal system. The biggest bone in the body is the femur in the upper leg, and the smallest is the stapes bone in the middle ear. In an adult, the skeleton comprises around 14% of the total body weight, and half of this weight is water.\n\n[3] Stapes: The stapes is the third bone of the three ossicles in the middle ear. The stapes is a stirrup-shaped bone, and the smallest in the human body. It rests on the oval window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament. The stapes is described as having a base, resting on the oval window, as well as a head that articulates with the incus. These are connected by anterior and posterior limbs (). The stapes articulates with the incus through the incudostapedial joint. The stapes is the smallest bone in the human body, and measures roughly 3 x 2.5mm, greater along the head-base span.\n\n[4] Stapedius muscle: The stapedius is the smallest skeletal muscle in the human body. At just over one millimeter in length, its purpose is to stabilize the smallest bone in the body, the stapes.\n\n[5] Trapezoid bone: The trapezoid bone (lesser multangular bone) is a carpal bone in tetrapods, including humans. It is the smallest bone in the distal row of carpal bones that give structure to the palm of the hand. It may be known by its wedge-shaped form, the broad end of the wedge constituting the dorsal, the narrow end the palmar surface; and by its having four articular facets touching each other, and separated by sharp edges. It is homologous with the \"second distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n[6] Capitate bone: The capitate bone is found in the center of the carpal bone region, colloquially known as the wrist, which is at the distal end of the radius and ulna bones. It articulates with the third metacarpal bone (the middle finger) and forms the third carpometacarpal joint. The capitate bone is the largest of the carpal bones in the human hand. It presents, above, a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the scaphoid and lunate bones; a constricted portion or neck; and below this, the body. The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the \"third distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n[7] Bone marrow: Bone marrow is a semi-solid tissue which may be found within the spongy or cancellous portions of bones. In birds and mammals, bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis. It is composed of hematopoietic cells, marrow adipose tissue, and supportive stromal cells. In adult humans, bone marrow is primarily located in the ribs, vertebrae, sternum, and bones of the pelvis. On average, bone marrow constitutes 4% of the total body mass of humans; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass (143 lb), bone marrow typically accounts for approximately .\n\n[8] Zygomatic bone: In the human skull, the zygomatic bone (cheekbone or malar bone) is a paired irregular bone which articulates with the maxilla, the temporal bone, the sphenoid bone and the frontal bone. It is situated at the upper and lateral part of the face and forms the prominence of the cheek, part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, and parts of the temporal fossa and the infratemporal fossa. It presents a malar and a temporal surface; four processes (the frontosphenoidal, orbital, maxillary, and temporal), and four borders.\n\n[9] Beishanlong: \"Beishanlong\" is of a considerable size, approximating the largest known individuals of \"Gallimimus\", which have been estimated to reach eight metres. According to the description, \"Beishanlong\" \"is one of the largest definitive ornithomimosaurs yet described, though histological analysis shows that the holotype individual was still growing at its death.\" Extrapolating from the sixty-six centimetres long thighbone, the describers estimated the weight at 626 kilogrammes. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 gave an estimate of seven metres length and five hundred fifty kilogrammes. A histological study of the bone structure of the fibula found thirteen or fourteen growth lines, indicating the individual was subadult, though growth had already slowed.\n\n[10] Bodo cranium: This specimen has an unusually large cranial capacity for its age that is estimated at around 1250 cc (in the range between ∼1,200–1,325 cc)  within the (lower) range of modern \"Homo sapiens\". The cranium includes the face, much of the frontal bone, parts of the midvault and the base anterior to the foramen magnum. The cranial length, width and height are 21 cm (8.3 in), 15.87 cm (6.2 in) and 19.05 cm (7.5 in) respectively. Researchers have suggested that Bodo butchered animals because Acheulean hand axes and cleavers, along with animal bones, were found at the site. The cranium has cut marks, which indicates that immediately after the death of this individual stone tools were used to remove the flesh from the bone.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Pizza is the most popular and best known creation of all Neapolitan cuisine. It soon became very popular among the people as well as barons or princes: it was present in the Bourbon court. King Ferdinand I experienced cooking pizza in Capodimonte's porcelain ovens. After Italian unification, the new kings were also attracted by this southern food. The \"pizzaiolo\" Raffaele Esposito created in 1889, in honour to queen Margherita of Savoy a nationalistic pizza, where the colours of the Italian flag were represented by the mozzarella (white), tomato (red) and basil (green). Since then this pizza is called the \"pizza Margherita\". Pizza can be cheap and nutritious, so it had great success very quickly. Sometimes pizza is made in home ovens, but the real Neapolitan pizza must be cooked in a wood-fired oven, hand-made by an able \"pizzaiolo\" who makes the dough disk thinner in the centre and thicker in the outer part; the ingredients and olive oil are rapidly spread on the disk, and with a quick movement the pizza is put on the shovel and then slid in the oven where it is turned around a few times for uniform cooking.\n\n[2] Pizza: The term \"pizza\" was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. Today it is one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via pizza delivery. Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven.\n\n[3] Pizza: Standard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust, called \"media masa\" (half dough) than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Argentine gastronomy tradition, served pizza with fainá, which is a Genovese chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza, and moscato wine. The most popular variety of pizza is called \"muzarela\" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato sauce and cheese) but made with a thicker \"media masa\" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives. It can be found in nearly every corner of the country; Buenos Aires is considered the city with the most pizza bars by person of the world. Other popular varieties include jam, tomato slices, red pepper and longaniza. Two Argentine-born varieties of pizza with onion, are also very popular: fugazza with cheese and fugazzetta. The former one consists in a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions; the later has the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top.\n\n[4] List of pizza varieties by country: In 1905, the first pizza establishment in the United States was opened in New York's Little Italy. Due to the influx of Italian immigrants, the U.S. has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. Chicago has its own style of a deep-dish pizza and New York City's style of pizza are well-known. New York-style pizza refers to the thin crust pizza popular in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Philadelphia provides sauce on top of the cheese; St. Louis and other Midwest pizzas use thin crusts and rectangular slices in its local pizzas. Detroit-style pizza is a square pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust, and is generally served with the sauce on top of the cheese. The square shape is the result of an early tradition of using metal trays originally meant to hold small parts in factories. The jumbo slice is an oversized New York-style pizza sold by the slice to go, especially in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The white clam pie is a pizza variety that originated at the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut. Also popular in the Southern United States and in California is the barbecue chicken pizza, first invented by Ed LaDou in 1985.\n\n[5] List of pizza varieties by country: Standard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust, called \"media masa\" (half dough) than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Argentine gastronomy tradition, served pizza with fainá, which is a Genovesi chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza, and moscato wine.

The former one consists in a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions; the later has the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top.\n\n[6] List of pizza varieties by country: São Paulo has 6,000 pizza establishments and 1.4 million pizzas are consumed daily. It is said that the first Brazilian pizzas were baked in the Brás district of São Paulo in the late part of the 19th century. Until the 1940s, almost only found in the Italian communities around the country. Since then, pizza became increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga (official name: Bela Vista). Both Neapolitan (thick crust) and Roman (thin crust) varieties are common in Brazil, with traditional versions using tomato sauce and mozzarella as a base. Brazilian pizza in general, though, tends to have less tomato sauce than the authentic (Italian) pizza, or uses slices of tomato in place of sauce. Brazilian pizzerias offer also Brazilian variants such as \"pizza com catupiry\". July 10 is \"Pizza Day\" in São Paulo, marking the final day of an annual competition among \"pizzaiolos\". In Brazil, pizza quatro queijos (\"pizza quattro formaggi\") uses mozzarella, provolone, parmesan and gorgonzola, and there is also a variety with five cheeses, which adds Catupiry brand soft cheese.\n\n[7] Patsy's Pizzeria: Patsy's Pizzeria was founded in what used to be the predominantly Italian neighborhood of East Harlem in 1933 by Pasquale \"Patsy\" Lanceri. When it opened it was one of New York's earliest pizzerias along with Lombardi's, Totonno's and John's. Patsy's claims to have originated the idea of selling pizza by the slice. Lancieri is said to have learned his craft at Lombardi's brick-walled coal oven. New York's pizza dynasties are now in their third and fourth generations, and counting. And in its neighborhood of Spanish Harlem (which at the time the restaurants were started was known as Italian Harlem), two restaurants \"vie for the title of El Barrio's best bite\": Patsy's Pizzeria \"where — so they say — the archetypal thin-crust New York pizza was first invented\" and nearby Rao's, which was run by legendary restaurateur/ \"Sopranos\" actor Frank Pellegrino until his death in 2017.\n\n[8] Pizza: Pizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign after being introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready market for pizza in particular. Since then pizza consumption has exploded in the U.S. Pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide. 13% of the US population consumes pizza on any given day.\n\n[9] Pizza Land: Pizza Land is an American owned pizzeria located at 260 Belleville Turnpike in North Arlington, New Jersey, which featured in the opening credits of \"The Sopranos\". Additionally, in \"Law & Order\" episode 10.6, \"Marathon\" (1999), a pizza box from the restaurant was used by a suspect to transport and conceal firearms. The pizzeria was opened in 1965 by Italian immigrant Frank Di Piazza, who died in 1991. It was owned by Frank's son Tony Di Piazza . Tony and Debra Hunkele always had the pizzeria packed but later on sold to pizza maker Al Pawlowicz until his death in 2010, who purchased the restaurant from DiPiazza's son. The store is now owned by Eddie Twdroos.\n\n[10] New Haven, Connecticut: New Haven's greatest culinary claim to fame may be its pizza, which has been claimed to be among the best in the country, or even in the world. New Haven-style pizza, called \"apizza\", made its debut at the iconic Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana (known as Pepe's) in 1925. Apizza is baked in coal- or wood-fired brick ovens, and is notable for its thin crust. Apizza may be red (with a tomato-based sauce) or white (with a sauce of garlic and olive oil), and pies ordered \"plain\" are made without the otherwise customary mozzarella cheese (originally smoked mozzarella, known as \"scamorza\" in Italian). A white clam pie is a well-known specialty of the restaurants on Wooster Street in the Little Italy section of New Haven, including Pepe's and Sally's Apizza (which opened in 1938). Modern Apizza on State Street, which opened in 1934, is also well-known. A second New Haven gastronomical claim to fame is Louis' Lunch, which is located in a small brick building on Crown Street and has been serving fast food since 1895. Though fiercely debated, the restaurant's founder Louis Lassen is credited by the Library of Congress with inventing the hamburger and steak sandwich. Louis' Lunch broils hamburgers, steak sandwiches and hot dogs vertically in original antique 1898 cast iron stoves using gridirons, patented by local resident Luigi Pieragostini in 1939, that hold the meat in place while it cooks.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nGlossectomy is the removal of all of or part of which body part?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Glossectomy: A glossectomy is the surgical removal of all or part of the tongue. It is performed in order to curtail malignant growth such as oral cancer. Often only a portion of the tongue needs to be removed, in which case the procedure is called a partial removal, or hemiglossectomy.\n\n[2] List of surgical procedures: Many surgical procedure names can be broken into parts to indicate the meaning. For example, in gastrectomy, \"ectomy\" is a suffix meaning the removal of a part of the body. \"Gastro-\" means stomach. Thus, \"gastrectomy\" refers to the surgical removal of the stomach (or sections thereof). \"Otomy\" means cutting into a part of the body; a \"gastrotomy\" would be cutting into, but not necessarily removing, the stomach. And also \"pharyngo\" means pharynx, \"laryngo\" means larynx, \"esophag\" means esophagus. Thus, \"pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy\" refers to the surgical removal of the three.\n\n[3] Laryngectomy: Laryngectomy is the removal of the larynx and separation of the airway from the mouth, nose and esophagus. In a total laryngectomy, the entire larynx is removed (including the vocal folds, hyoid bone, epiglottis, thyroid and cricoid cartilage and a few tracheal cartilage rings). In a partial laryngectomy, only a portion of the larynx is removed. Following the procedure, the person breathes through an opening in the neck known as a stoma. This procedure is usually performed by an ENT surgeon in cases of laryngeal cancer. Many cases of laryngeal cancer are treated with more conservative methods (surgeries through the mouth, radiation and/or chemotherapy). A laryngectomy is performed when these treatments fail to conserve the larynx or when the cancer has progressed such that normal functioning would be prevented. Laryngectomies are also performed on individuals with other types of head and neck cancer. Post-laryngectomy rehabilitation includes voice restoration, oral feeding and more recently, smell and taste rehabilitation. An individual's quality of life can be affected post-surgery.\n\n[4] Embolectomy: Embolectomy is the emergency surgical removal of emboli which are blocking blood circulation. It usually involves removal of thrombi (blood clots), and is then referred to as thrombectomy. Embolectomy is an emergency procedure often as the last resort because permanent occlusion of a significant blood flow to an organ leads to necrosis. Other involved therapeutic options are anticoagulation and thrombolysis.\n\n[5] Colectomy: Colectomy (\"col-\" + \"-ectomy\") is bowel resection of the large bowel (colon). It consists of the surgical removal of any extent of the colon, usually segmental resection (partial colectomy). In extreme cases where the entire large intestine is removed, it is called total colectomy, and proctocolectomy (\"procto-\" + \"colectomy\") denotes that the rectum is included.\n\n[6] Dextro-Transposition of the great arteries: An atrial septectomy is the surgical removal of the atrial septum; this is performed when a patent foramen ovale ( PFO ), or atrial septal defect ( ASD ) are not present and additional shunting is required to raise the oxygen saturation of the blood flowing eventually into the aorta.In recent years, it is quite rare for palliative procedures to be done via median sternotomy. However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time.An NG tube is used to deliver nourishment, and occasionally medication, to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the stomach, it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is digesting their \"food\". Paediatric units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to pump their breastmilk, which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use.\n\n[7] Hysterectomy: Hysterectomy, in the literal sense of the word, means merely removal of the uterus. However other organs such as ovaries, fallopian tubes and the cervix are very frequently removed as part of the surgery.Subtotal (supracervical) hysterectomy was originally proposed with the expectation that it may improve sexual functioning after hysterectomy, it has been postulated that removing the cervix causes excessive neurologic and anatomic disruption, thus leading to vaginal shortening, vaginal vault prolapse, and vaginal cuff granulations. These theoretical advantages were not confirmed in practice, but other advantages over total hysterectomy emerged. The principal disadvantage is that risk of cervical cancer is not eliminated and women may continue cyclical bleeding (although substantially less than before the surgery). These issues were addressed in a systematic review of total versus supracervical hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions, which reported the following findings:In the short-term, randomized trials have shown that cervical preservation or removal does not affect the rate of subsequent pelvic organ prolapse.\n\n[8] Glaucoma surgery: An iridectomy, also known as a corectomy or surgical iridectomy, involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue. A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; and a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.\n\n[9] Discectomy: A discectomy (also called open discectomy, if done through a 1/2 inch or larger skin opening) is the surgical removal of abnormal disc material that presses on a nerve root or the spinal cord. The procedure involves removing a portion of an intervertebral disc, which causes pain, weakness or numbness by stressing the spinal cord or radiating nerves. The traditional open discectomy, or Love's technique, was published by Ross and Love in 1971. Advances have produced visualization improvements to traditional discectomy procedures (e.g. microdiscectomy, an open discectomy using an external microscope typically done through a 1 inch or larger skin opening), or endoscopic discectomy (the scope passes internally and typically done through a 2 mm skin opening or larger, up to 12 mm). In conjunction with the traditional discectomy or microdiscectomy, a laminotomy is often involved to permit access to the intervertebral disc. Laminotomy means a significant amount of typically normal bone (the lamina) is removed from the vertebra, allowing the surgeon to better see and access the area of disc herniation.\n\n[10] Coccygectomy: Coccygectomy is a surgical procedure in which the coccyx or tailbone is removed. It is considered a required treatment for sacrococcygeal teratoma and other germ cell tumors arising from the coccyx. Coccygectomy is the treatment of last resort for coccydynia (coccyx pain) which has failed to respond to nonsurgical treatment. Non surgical treatments include use of seat cushions, external or internal manipulation and massage of the coccyx and the attached muscles, medications given by local injections under fluoroscopic guidance, and medications by mouth.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Film and media critics have alleged that Dittman's reviews are intended to get him mentioned in international advertising and press material for movies, which has given him the pejorative title of a quote whore. Critics have also noted that some of his quotes have been included in advertisements for movies that had not been pre-screened for critics. Dittman was named as one of top ten \"movie quote whores\" of 2005.\n\n[3] Adrian (costume designer): Adrian Adolph Greenburg (March 3, 1903 — September 13, 1959), widely known as Adrian, was an American costume designer whose most famous costumes were for \"The Wizard of Oz\" and hundreds of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films between 1928 and 1941. He was usually credited onscreen with the phrase \"Gowns by Adrian\". Early in his career he chose the professional name Gilbert Adrian, a combination of his father's forename and his own.\n\n[4] Apartment Zero: Adrian LeDuc (Firth) is the British owner of a revival house in Buenos Aires. Adrian is emotionally repressed, prone to suspicion and paranoia, devoted to old movies and to his mother, who resides in a nursing home, suffering from dementia. Adrian visits her frequently, holding conversations that, as her illness progresses, become increasingly one-sided. Adrian resides as a tenant in a rundown apartment building; he lives in apartment 10, although the 1 is missing from his door (hence the film's title). Apart from his mother, the core of his emotional life is movies, specifically classic American movies and stars. The story begins with Adrian in his theater, watching the final scene of \"Touch of Evil\".\n\n[5] Jayan quotes: Jayan quotes (ജയൻ ചൊല്ലുകൾ) or Jayan dialogues (ജയൻ ഡയലോഗുകൾ) are satirical quotes of superhuman strength in Malayalam that are based on the late action star Jayan who was a famed stunt performer during his movie career. Jayan worked in malayalam cinema, a sector of the Indian movie industry based in Kerala and was a highly popular stunt actor of his time. Jayan quotes began as an internet & sms phenomenon amongst malayalees around the world in the early 2000s as part of the Jayan phenomenon & resurgence which started in the late 1990s. These satirical quotes are the first known collection of its kind from anywhere in the world (other factoids like those on Chuck Norris, Kyle Katarn, Rajnikanth, Dharmendra etc. emerged later after 2004). Soon the quotes attained mainstream popularity and have become an integral part of popular culture in Kerala.\n\n[6] List of The Secret Life of the American Teenager characters: Portrayed by Francia Raisa, Adrian is the daughter of Ruben Enriquez and Cindy Lee, and the ex-wife of Ben. She is 20 years old. Adrian is both book smart and street smart, hard-edged and emotional. Although she is a straight-A student and a majorette, she has a reputation for being a drama queen and the \"school slut\". She also has strong feelings for Ricky despite claiming she doesn't anymore since they stopped speaking to each other. Adrian grew up never knowing who her father was, until she went on a search to find him. Her father ended up marrying her mother after 16 years of being apart from each other. Adrian and her parents now live next door to the Juergens family. Her mother is a flight attendant and her father is a District Attorney. Like Ricky, Adrian is also known to use sex to deal with pain. In the episode \"Be My, Be My Baby\", she reveals that she first had sex when she was fifteen, with her childhood best friend Antonio, who was moving away in order to get cancer treatments. Adrian was infuriated after she found out that Ricky kissed Amy, believing that it went beyond kissing, even though it was a mostly innocent encounter. Adrian had a one-night-stand with Ben in retaliation, and ended up becoming pregnant with his child. She had her mind set on abortion, but she eventually backed out and decided to keep the baby. Adrian's decision to keep the baby received a lot of positive support from her father and even Amy, who had called her to let her know that she was giving Adrian the same offer of a friendship between them that she had given her in the past, because their children might end up becoming friends. Adrian later finds out that she is having a baby girl, which both she and Ben are excited about, and she and Ben\n\n[7] Slađana Milošević: As a director and a screenwriter, Aleksandra promoted the book, putting up an outdoor theatrical performance in Belgrade’s Knez Mihailova Street. One of the critic’s highlights of the book \"Adam Don't Get Mad\" is the commentary made by one of the world most famous living authors Paulo Coelho: “When I first met Alexandra in ‘97, I was struck by the boldness and originality of her self-expression. Then I spoke to her and quickly noticed her acumen and sharp wit. Over the years we've kept in touch. I've learned that Alexandra is not only a versatile and eclectic person, but a highly resourceful individual as well. She has something that I've always admired in people: a heart to dream and courage to make her dreams come true. I hope that this book will just be the beginning of a long and rewarding writing career”.\n\n[8] Joko Anwar: During an interview with Nia Dinata for The Jakarta Post, the film producer was impressed and asked him to write for her new project which was later titled \"Arisan!\" (2003). The film earned commercial and critical success and won numerous awards including \"Best Film\" at the 2005 Indonesian Film Festival and \"Best Movie\" at the 2004 MTV Indonesia Movie Awards. He went on to direct a feature film, the romantic comedy \"Janji Joni\" (\"Joni's Promise\") (2005), which he wrote when he was in college in 1998. This feature directorial debut was the #1 box office hit in Indonesia that year and won \"Best Movie\" at the 2005 MTV Indonesia Movie Awards. SET Foundation which is chaired by renowned Indonesian filmmaker Garin Nugroho gave him a special award for innovative storytelling in a movie. \"Janji Joni\" (Joni's Promise) was selected in several prestigious international film festivals including by Sydney Film Festival and Pusan International Film Festival. The film revived the career of Barry Prima, an international cult martial-art actor, who is Anwar's childhood hero.\n\n[9] Paul Y. Anderson: The most moving tribute to Anderson came from Heywood Broun, who took exception to an article in \"Time\" calling attention to Anderson's drinking. Anderson, Broun wrote, had worked \"constantly under punishing tension\" and had worn \"a hair shirt of complete dedication to the things in which he believed,\" adding: But just about the last person in the world with any right to mention the matter is some little snip sitting with scissors and paste pot in the office of Time piecing out the curious sign language in which that magazine is written for the delectation of commuters and clubwomen. Paul Y. Anderson, drunk or sober, was by so much the finest journalist of his day that it is not fitting for any moist-eared chit even to touch the hem of his weakness. It is not necessary for anybody to make apologies for Paul Y. Anderson. Taken in his entirety, he stands up as a man deserving love and homage from every working newspaperman and woman in the United States. We will carry on.\n\n[10] Anthony Monday (series): Anthony Monday is a fictional 14-year-old American boy featured in a series of four children's gothic horror novels by John Bellairs that were published from 1978 to 1992. Anthony and his friends generally overcome evil forces bent on ending the world. Alternatively, Anthony Monday is the book series, as in ISFDB.. Brad Strickland, who has completed Bellairs' works posthumously and written new novels based on his characters has noted that Anthony Monday was disliked by those in charge of publishing and any book ideas with Anthony as the character were rejected. This is why there has not been an Anthony Monday book since John Bellairs died.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He has also provided his voice to films, television series and video games, including Mr. Krabs in \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" (1999–present), Lex Luthor in various media, Doctor Neo Cortex in the \"Crash Bandicoot\" video games (1997–2003), Surtur in \"\" (2017) and Lt. Hank Anderson in \"\" (2018).\n\n[2] Clarence Brown: In 1957, Brown was awarded The George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film. Brown retired a wealthy man due to his real estate investments, but refused to watch new movies, as he feared they might cause him to restart his career. The Clarence Brown Theater, on the campus of the University of Tennessee, is named in his honor. He holds the record for most nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director without a win, with six.\n\n[3] Clarence John Brown: Clarence John Brown was a Vice Admiral in the United States Navy.\n\n[4] Larry Buchanan: Buchanan is perhaps best known for exploitation, science fiction, and other genre films, including \"Free, White and 21\", \"High Yellow\", \"The Naked Witch\" (made for $8,000), \"The Loch Ness Horror\", and \"Mistress of the Apes\". Among Buchanan's work, eight direct-to-television films he wrote, produced, and directed under his own Azalea Films production entity in the mid- and late-1960s, for American International Pictures, still generate a good degree of fan adoration. The titles − \"The Eye Creatures\", \"Zontar, The Thing from Venus\", \"Creature of Destruction\", \"Mars Needs Women\", \"In the Year 2889\", \"Curse of the Swamp Creature\", \"Hell Raiders\", and \"It's Alive!\" − were largely remakes of AIP films from a decade earlier. Buchanan's instructions from AIP were: \"We want cheap color pictures, we want half-assed names in them, we want them eighty minutes long and we want them now\".\n\n[5] Clarence Williams (tight end): Clarence Williams III (born August 7, 1969) is a former professional American football tight end and running back who played in the National Football League for the Cleveland Browns. His father was Washington State All-American and Los Angeles Rams standout Clarence \"Clancy\" Williams. Like his father, Clarence III also played college football for the Washington State Cougars football. He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the 7th round (169th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft.\n\n[6] Bryan Brown: Brown had the lead in the low budget film \"Third Person Plural\" (1979) from James Ricketson and a key role in Jeffrey's \"The Odd Angry Shot\" (1979) and Crombie's \"Cathy's Child\" (1979). He played the lead in a short for Wallace, \"Conman Harry and the Others\" (1979), and had a leading role in Albie Thoms' \"Palm Beach\" (1980).\n\n[7] Bryan Brown: Brown was given the lead role in a US action film, \"F/X\" (1986), which was a hit. However \"Tai-Pan\" (1986), directed by Daryl Duke from \"The Thorn Birds\", was a huge flop, despite being based on a best seller by James Clavell.\n\n[8] Edward Burns: Burns is also known for his acting work on movies such as \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998), \"Life or Something Like It\" (2002), and \"Confidence\" (2003). \"Looking for Kitty\" (2004), which Burns wrote, directed and starred in, was shot with a hand-held $3,000 digital Panasonic AG-DVX100 camera with a Mini35 adapter. The film's entire budget was $200,000 and was filmed in New York City with a tiny crew and without standard permits. Burns discussed this unusual film-making process in the director's commentary on the DVD and wrote in the Director's Letter \"If you are an aspiring filmmaker, in this day of inflating budgets and runaway production, the truth is you can make a movie for no money in New York... and have a blast\".\n\n[9] Bill McKinney: Other memorable roles include Jay Cobb, who is done in by John Wayne's \"The Shootist\". He also appeared in such later films as \"First Blood\", \"Back to the Future Part III\" and \"The Green Mile\". He appeared in the TV movie \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" (1974) and guest-starred on such television shows as the 1976 western \"Sara\", \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\", \"Starsky and Hutch\", \"The A-Team\", \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"Columbo: Swan Song\" and \"In The Heat of The Night\".. He had an uncredited role in the TV miniseries \"Roots\" (1977), playing alongside Georg Stanford Brown, Lloyd Bridges and Burl Ives.\n\n[10] Nicholas Brown III: Nicholas Carter Brown III was born on October 2, 1792, in Providence, Rhode Island, the eldest of three surviving children born to Nicholas Brown, Jr. (1769–1841), the namesake patron of Brown University, and Ann Carter, daughter of John Carter, a prominent printer in Providence. His younger brother was John Carter Brown II (1797–1874). His grandfather was Nicholas Brown, Sr. (1729–1791), brother of John Brown, Moses Brown, and Joseph Brown, who was a merchant and slavetrader who co-founded the College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations which is today known as Brown University.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Since its completion in 1973 the city's Opera House has become a World Heritage Site and one of the world's most renowned pieces of Modern design. It was conceived by Jørn Utzon with contributions from Peter Hall, Lionel Todd, and David Littlemore. Utzon was awarded the Pritzker Prize in 2003 for his work on the Opera House. Sydney is home to Australia's first building by renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry, the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building (2015), based on the design of a tree house. An entrance from The Goods Line–a pedestrian pathway and former railway line–is located on the eastern border of the site.\n\n[2] Postmodern architecture: The Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia, by the Danish architect Jørn Utzon (1918–2008) is one of the most recognizable of all works of postwar architecture, and spans the transition from modernism to postmodernism. Construction began in 1957 but it was not completed until 1973 due to difficult engineering problems and growing costs. The giant shells of concrete soar over the platforms which form the roof of the hall itself. The architect resigned before the structure was completed, and the interior was designed largely after he left the project. The influence of the Sydney Opera House, can be seen in later concert halls with soaring roofs made of undulating stainless steel.\n\n[3] Architecture of Sydney: Opened in 1973, the Sydney Opera House was designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon. Its construction was partly financed by the Opera House Lottery. Utzon left under acrimonious circumstances before the building was finished; later work was completed by other architects. Located on Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, the building is a World Heritage Site. The tallest point in the city is the Sydney Tower built in the late 1970s-early 1980s, when height restrictions were far more lenient. The observation tower provides views of the entire city.\n\n[4] Sydney Opera House: The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n[5] Joseph Cahill: It was in November 1954 that Cahill first began to champion the idea of an opera house in Sydney on the site of the old Fort Macquarie Tram Depot at Bennelong Point, announcing an international competition for its design in September 1955, which was subsequently won by Danish Architect, Jørn Utzon in January 1957. In August 1957, Cahill responded to criticisms that the opera house was an extravagance and inaccessible to the ordinary public by noting that, \"the building when erected will be available for the use of every citizen, that the average working family will be able to afford to go there just as well as people in more favourable economic circumstances, that there will be nothing savouring even remotely of a class conscious barrier and that the Opera House will, in fact, be a monument to democratic nationhood in its fullest sense.\"\n\n[6] Circular Quay: In 1984, Lionel Todd (Sydney Opera House Stage 3 Architect), proposed his semi-circular quay concept to enhance views of the opera house from the main pedestrian approach, and extend the Royal Botanic Gardens over Macquarie Street, to Sydney Cove. In 1994 the Anti-Wall Committee was formed to protect the Sydney Opera House from nearby urban development. In 1997 the \"Save East Circular Quay Committee\" was convened by Tony Rodi and Paul Johnson, and chaired by Neville Gruzman, and later by Jack Mundey in the battle to stop the desecration of the Sydney Opera House precinct. Mundey, Doug Sutherland, Todd, and Kell Hutchence, joined the battle, urged by an unprecedented public outcry against an apartment development, which obliterated views of the Sydney Opera House from the main pedestrian approach. In the final stages, the controversial development attracted international attention which included \"The New York Times\" and \"Christian Science Monitor\". The resulting development of Bennelong Apartments (coined as \"The Toaster\") dominates the eastern shore of Circular Quay and is highly controversial for its positioning, encroachment onto previously public space, and mediocre design quality, and primarily for obscuring views of the Sydney Opera House, from the main pedestrian approach.\n\n[7] Sydney Opera House: Planning began in the late 1940s, when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD.\n\n[8] Joseph Cahill: On 5 February 1959, Cahill signed the contract for the first stage of building works for the Opera House with the Chairman of Lendlease Corporation and Civil & Civic, Dick Dusseldorp, and the managing director of Brederos, Jan de Vries. On the occasion of the official start of building and the laying of the foundation plaque on 2 March 1959, Cahill declared that the Sydney Opera House, \"will stand not merely as an outstanding example of modern architecture or even as a world famous opera house, but as a shrine in which the great artists of the world may be seen and heard and our own artists may display the flowering of Australian culture.\"\n\n[9] Sydney Opera House Grand Organ: The Sydney Opera House Grand Organ is the world's largest mechanical tracker-action pipe organ. It is located in the concert hall of Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia and was designed by Ronald Sharp, who was assisted by Mark Fisher, Myk Fairhurst and Raymond Bridge.\n\n[10] Swan House, Chelsea Embankment: The house built in 1875-76 made a home for solicitor and art collector Wickham Flower and his artist wife Elizabeth. Norman Shaw, known for the Piccadilly Hotel in Piccadilly Circus, Cragside in Northumberland and Lowther Lodge in Kensington, now headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society, served as the architect. Shaw designed the lower part of the building in the Queen Anne Revival style popular during the Victorian Era. He incorporated bay windows on the second floor and dormer windows at the top floor for an unusual look. On the third floor, Shaw alternated flat narrow windows with caged oriel windows. In 1892, \"The British Architect\" hailed Swan House and the six other homes Shaw designed in the Chelsea Embankment as “masterpieces.”\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He first appeared on 13 October 1958 in the children's book \"A Bear Called Paddington\" and has been featured in more than twenty books written by British author Michael Bond and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum and other artists. The friendly bear from Peru—with his old hat, battered suitcase (complete with a secret compartment, enabling it to hold more items than it would appear to), duffle coat and love of marmalade—has become a classic character from English children's literature. Paddington books have been translated into 30 languages across 70 titles and sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. A much loved fictional character in British culture, a Paddington Bear soft toy was chosen by British tunnellers as the first item to pass through to their French counterparts when the two sides of the Channel Tunnel were linked in 1994.\n\n[2] Peggy Fortnum: Her best-known illustrations are of Michael Bond's character, Paddington Bear. The first illustrations of Paddington were made by Fortnum for \"A Bear called Paddington\". Fortnum's original illustrations were used for HarperCollins's 1998 reissue of \"A Bear Called Paddington\", which celebrated the first Paddington book's 40th anniversary.\n\n[3] Paddington Bear: The fourteenth collection of the main series includes these stories: This picture book is the finale of the original Paddington series.It was finished before Michael Bond's death. The final book in the \"Paddington\" series to be written by the creator himself was released on 27 June 2018 to mark the anniversary of the day that Michael Bond died and the 60th anniversary of \"A Bear Called Paddington\".Author Michael Bond was also a BBC TV cameraman who worked on the popular children's television programme \"Blue Peter\". After this was revealed in 1965, a special Paddington story, in which he got mixed up in the programme itself, appeared in the \"Blue Peter Annuals\" for many years. They were collected in the novel-length \"Paddington's Blue Peter Story Book\" in 1973. A second book based around \"Blue Peter\" was titled \"Paddington on Screen\".\n\n[4] Statue of Paddington Bear: The author Michael Bond introduced Paddington Bear to the world in 1958. Inspired by his purchase of a teddy bear as a Christmas present for his wife, and naming the bear Paddington as the couple lived near Paddington Station, Bond imagined the arrival of a real bear at the station in his first novel, \"A Bear Called Paddington\". Paddington travels to London from Lima, Peru, stowed away in the life boat of a transatlantic vessel, equipped only with a small suitcase, some marmalade sandwiches and a note attached to his coat which reads, \"Please look after this bear. Thank you\". Adopted by the Brown family, he undergoes a series of adventures, published in fourteen volumes between 1958 and 2018. The last in the series, \"Paddington's Finest Hour\", was published posthumously, following Bond's death at the age of 91 on 27 June 2017.\n\n[5] Paddington (film): Paddington is a 2014 live-action animated comedy film written and directed by Paul King from a story by King and Hamish McColl and produced by David Heyman. Based on the stories of the character Paddington Bear created by Michael Bond, the film stars Ben Whishaw as the voice of the title character, with Hugh Bonneville, Sally Hawkins, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent, Peter Capaldi, and Nicole Kidman in live-action roles. The film tells the story of the eponymous character Paddington, an anthropomorphic bear who migrates from the jungles of Peru to the streets of London, where he is adopted by the Brown family. Kidman plays the role of a taxidermist, who attempts to add him to her collection.\n\n[6] Paddington Bear: Michael Bond based Paddington Bear on a lone teddy bear he noticed on a shelf in a London store near Paddington Station on Christmas Eve 1956, which he bought as a present for his wife. The bear inspired Bond to write a story; and, in ten days, he had written the first book. The book was given to his agent, Harvey Unna. \"A Bear Called Paddington\" was first published on 13 October 1958 by William Collins & Sons.\n\n[7] Exercise Paddington Diamond: In early 1987 the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) arranged a group of adventure training exercises for military personnel in the high Andes of Peru and Bolivia. These exercises were identified by the group name ‘Paddington’ (a reference to Paddington Bear, a fictional children’s character created by author Michael Bond and said to be from Peru). Under that umbrella were a number of expedition groups pursuing different activities: hiking, caving etc. The designations identifying individual groups were ‘Paddington’ followed by the name of a geometric shape. The caving group in Peru was ‘Paddington Triangle’. The diving expedition to the Bolivian waters of Lake Titicaca was Paddington Diamond.\n\n[8] Michael Bond: Thomas Michael Bond (13 January 1926 – 27 June 2017) was a British author. He is best known for a series of fictional stories for children, featuring the character of Paddington Bear. More than 35 million Paddington books have been sold around the world, and the characters have also been featured in film and on television. His first book was published in 1958 and his last in 2017, a span of 59 years.\n\n[9] Paddington Bear (TV series): Paddington Bear is an American/British animated television series. It  was the second television adaptation of the children's book series and made by Hanna-Barbera in association with Central Independent Television. The character of an American boy named David, Jonathan and Judy Brown's cousin who arrived in London on the same day as Paddington, was added to the stories in this incarnation, it was part of \"The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera\" in 1989 and lasted 13 episodes.\n\n[10] Paddington Bear: Paddington is an anthropomorphised bear. He is always polite – addressing people as \"Mr\", \"Mrs\" and \"Miss\", rarely by first names – and kindhearted, though he inflicts hard stares on those who incur his disapproval. He has an endless capacity for innocently getting into trouble, but he is known to \"try so hard to get things right.\" He was discovered in Paddington Station, London, by the (human) Brown family who adopted him, and thus he gives his full name as \"Paddington Brown\". As of June 2016, the Paddington Bear franchise is now owned by Vivendi's StudioCanal. Bond, however, continued to own the publishing rights to his series (until his death on 27 June 2017), which were licensed to HarperCollins in April 2017 for the next six years.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The bubon consists of a wooden ring with a diameter of up to which has a skin (often from a dog) tightened over one or sometimes both sides. Occasionally, and increasingly in more modern times (late 20th century) holes are made in the wooden sides into which metal (brass) rings are placed which rattle when the bubon is struck with the hand or a stick. The first mentions of the bubon date back to the 11th century. It was also a popular instrument among the Ukrainian Cossacks.\n\n[2] Tambourine: Buben (Бубен in Russian, Бубон in Ukrainian, \"boben\" in Slovenian, \"buben\" in Czech, \"bęben\" in Polish) is a musical instrument of the percussion family similar to a tambourine. A buben consists of a wooden or metal hoop with a tight membrane stretched over one of its sides (some bubens have no membrane at all). Certain kinds of bubens are equipped with clanking metal rings, plates, cymbals, or little bells. It is held in the hand and can be played in numerous ways, from stroking or shaking the jingles to striking it sharply with hand. It is used for rhythmical accompaniment during dances, soloist or choral singing. Buben is often used by some folk and professional bands, as well as orchestras.\n\n[3] Tsymbaly: The instrument is often used in folk ensembles known as \"Troyista muzyka\", usually made up of 3 instruments played in an ensemble with the violin, basolia, sopilka or bubon.\n\n[4] Music of Barbados: The Barbadian folk tradition is home to a great variety of musical instruments, imported from Africa, Great Britain or other Caribbean islands. The most central instrument group in Barbadian culture is the percussion instruments. These include numerous drums, among them the \"pump\" and the \"tum tum\", made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, the side snare drum and a double-headed bass drum of tuk bands. Folk musicians also use gongs made from tree trunks, bones, rook jaw, triangle, cymbals, bottles filled with water, and xylophones. Rattles are also widespread, and include the pan-Antillean \"shak-shak\" and the calabash, \"de shot and rattle\". More recently imported folk percussion instruments include the conga and bongo from Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Cuba, and the tambourine.\n\n[5] God's Trombones: Johnson observed an absence of attention in folklore studies to what he called a \"folk sermon,\" then went on to describe its nature and specific examples from his memory: Johnson explains the title's use of the trombone by discussing the vocal and rhetorical qualities of a preacher he had recently heard who, he felt, exemplified the compelling and persuasive nature of the folk preacher, naming the trombone as \"the instrument possessing above all others the power to express the wide and varied range of emotions encompassed by the human voice — and with greater amplitude.\" He also cited a dictionary definition that noted the trombone as being the brass instrument most resembling the range and sound of the human voice.\n\n[6] When (band): 1992 saw the release of \"Svartedauen\" (Norwegian for \"The Black Death\"), a 38-minute musical description of the ravages of the bubonic plague in Norway around 1349. The album borrows elements from Norwegian folk music, and features a host of disturbing sounds: hearses, moans of the dying, rats, flagellants' whips and a scythe being sharpened, to name but a few.\n\n[7] Comparative Anatomy (band): Comparative Anatomy use only two bass guitars for the main lines of their music, one referred to as the 'treble bass' due to its unusual tuning, special amplifier, settings, and pedals. Sir Puffers typically keeps his bass tuned higher than Ron Chickenbaby's, restricting himself to simple structures and chords. This is then offset with the other bass guitar, complex drum programming, and samples. Ron Chickenbaby plays what is referred to as the 'bass bass', a five-string which is tuned a variety of ways depending on the song, though they tend to play on octaves. Other instruments in recent work include grand pianos, church organs, and a variety of source-recorded objects. One of the biggests differences between Comparative Anatomy and other acts, however is that they never sing. Vocals were replaced early on with source recordings of animals, which the band admitted was due to \"the fact that [they] can't play and sing at the same time\". This is perhaps the most distinct piece of their music, creating a strange landscape of animal sounds along with their grind-styled riffs. Each song follows a particular animal, and sounds from each animal are used in its particular song. Their songs also often incorporate clips from popular culture, programmed along with the drum patterns to create odd, driving landscapes of screeching animals, bizarre electronics, eccentric humor, and textured bass lines.\n\n[8] Culture of Basilan: The gabbang is a bamboo split into five, and arranged like a xylophone. Small children near the fields played it in order to guard the crops against prying animals. The kwintangan batakan is an earlier form of gabbang which has six, seven, or nine bamboo pieces. The suling is a bamboo mouth flute used by the men in courting women. Another bamboo instrument used by the men in expressing love or admiration is the kulaing. The Kulintangan or kwintangan consists of several bronze gongs arranged according to size, and used during celebrations such as weddings and graduations. Any individual played it in the home and after work, for self-expression and relaxation. The agong is a percussion instrument used to announce marriage or for tolling the dead. The jabujabu (djabu-djabu) is a type of drum that summons the people to prayer (Nicolas 1977: 100–108; Sherfan 1976:195–199).\n\n[9] Bones (instrument): The bones are a musical instrument (more specifically, a folk instrument) which, at the simplest, consists of a pair of animal bones, or pieces of wood or a similar material. Sections of large rib bones and lower leg bones are the most commonly used true bones, although wooden sticks shaped like the earlier true bones are now more often used. If metal spoons are used instead, as is common in the United States, this is called \"playing the spoons\". The technique probably arrived in the U.S. via Irish and other European immigrants, and has a history stretching back to ancient China, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. They have contributed to many music genres, including 19th century minstrel shows, traditional Irish and Scottish music, the blues, bluegrass, zydeco, French-Canadian music, and music from Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. The clacking of the loose rib bones produces a much sharper sound than the zydeco washboard or frottoir, which mimics rattling a bone up and down a fixed ribcage.\n\n[10] Bob Burns (humorist): Practicing in the back of Hayman's Plumbing Shop one night, he picked up a length of gas pipe and blew into it, creating an unusual sound. With modifications, this became a musical instrument he named a \"bazooka\" (after \"bazoo\", meaning a windy fellow, from the Dutch \"bazuin\" for \"trumpet\"). A photograph shows him playing his invention in the Silver Cornet Band. Functioning like a crude trombone, the musical bazooka had a narrow range, but this was intentional.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Subsequently, the STAR TV network dropped the BBC channels from its satellite offer. This, and many ensuing declarations from Murdoch, led critics to believe the businessman was striving to appease the Chinese government in order to have the ban lifted. It is also alleged that the PRC government was unhappy with BBC coverage and threatened to block STAR TV in the huge mainland Chinese market if the BBC was not withdrawn. This is despite technology that is capable of blocking BBC World in China, while making it available in other countries they serve.\n\n[2] BBC News: The BBC was banned in Burma (officially Myanmar) after their coverage and commentary on anti-government protests there in September 2007. The ban was lifted four years later in September 2011. Other cases have included Uzbekistan, China, and Pakistan. The BBC online news site's Persian version was blocked from the Iranian internet in 2006. The BBC News website was made available in China again in March 2008, but , was blocked again.\n\n[3] Yousaf Raza Gillani: Gillani followed the cultural and television policy of Benazir Bhutto and in the light of Supreme Court verdict, Gillani ordered PEMRA to blackout of Indian television channels, though he ordered the restoration of religious channels. Gillani emphasised the role of Pakistan's media and encouraged the film, drama, and national performing art industry to promote national spirit in the country. In 2011, after the \"Secret Pakistan\" went on-air, Gillani ordered the blocking out of the BBC World and banned the channel in the country. Banning of BBC World deeply concerned the BBC authorities and the BBC executives immediately met with Gillani to resolve the issue. The BBC World was restored after BBC world ordered a full-fledged investigation into the matter.\n\n[4] International BBC television channels: In mid-1994, there was a commercial dispute between BBC World Service Television and STAR TV, where the proposed joint venture by the latter was inconclusive and News Corporation didn't pay for the support and services that BBC News provided after over 3 years. As a result, their license for using the name BBC Television would initially expire. At British Broadcasting Corporations request, the deadline was extended twice from 1 February and finally on 30 April 1994. Following that, Rupert Murdoch is asking for a compensation of about HK$102.5 trillion (US$250 million) from the said company. This situation is said to benefit new look and rebranded which may become the next service that completely replaces BBC News. The dispute also caused BBC World Service Television to lose its monopoly to broadcast the STAR News.\n\n[5] BBC Scotland: On 22 February 2017, director general Tony Hall announced plans to launch a dedicated English-language BBC Scotland channel in 2018, which would replace the current BBC Two Scotland opt-out. It would broadcast from 7:00 p.m. to midnight nightly, and feature a lineup composed entirely of new and archived Scottish programming, including a new hour-long 9:00 p.m. weeknight newscast that will be produced from Scotland. The proposed newscast been considered a response to the perennial proposals for a local opt-out of the \"BBC News at Six\". Hall also announced that the BBC would increase its overall spending on factual and drama productions in Scotland by £20 million annually. The BBC Scotland channel was approved by Ofcom in June 2018, and was subsequently scheduled to launch February 2019. The channel will be allocated £32 million in annual funding, and it is proposed that it would displace BBC Four on the EPG.\n\n[6] 2021 FIFA Confederations Cup: On 25 February 2015, this resulted in FIFA officially announcing that it would move the 2021 Confederations Cup to another country of the Asian Football Confederation, so it could still be held during the traditional window of June/July 2021, without interrupting domestic leagues. As compensation, another FIFA tournament, potentially the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, would be held in Qatar in November/December 2021, as the test event for the 2022 World Cup.\n\n[7] BBC OS: The programme was launched on BBC World Service on 28 October 2013; and on BBC World News on 17 February 2014. It began being broadcast in the UK on 1 June 2015, though it has been broadcast during major stories in the past. In March 2017 the radio programme was renamed \"BBC OS\". In 2017, the radio programme was moved to 16:00GMT to go out at the same time as the TV version. But in July, this was changed to 19:00GMT to allow an edition of \"World News Today\" to be broadcast at 19:00 UK Time.\n\n[8] Daniela Ritorto: Since starting at BBC World News Ritorto has been the presenter for a number of programmes including the main weekend overnight presenter of \"BBC World News\" which is broadcast on BBC News in the UK, around the world on BBC World News and on public television in America, live from the 'World's Newsroom in London'. Other roles she has held for the BBC are; the London presenter of \"Newsday\", \"World News Today\", \"Newsnight\", & \"Outside Source\" primarily on a relief/need-by-need basis. However, in January 2016 Ritorto posted onto Twitter that she had returned to Australia and had left the BBC after 3 years of service. Daniela joined the Special Broadcasting Service's political team in Canberra on 1 February 2016.\n\n[9] BBC World News: Another BBC World News programme, the hour-long \"BBC World News America\", aired on BBC America at 19:00 Eastern Time. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that \"BBC World News America\" would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local PBS stations in the United States as a 30-minute program.\n\n[10] BBC America: From 2007 to 2011, BBC America broadcast \"BBC World News America\", a live Washington, D.C.–based program anchored by Matt Frei. Katty Kay served as a Washington-based correspondent. On February 18, 2011, network management announced that \"BBC World News America\" would be dropped from BBC America and would instead be broadcasting only on the BBC World News channel and PBS member stations in the United States.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", the art historian Martin Kemp says there are some difficulties in confirming the actual dates with certainty. In addition, many Leonardo experts, such as Carlo Pedretti and Alessandro Vezzosi, are of the opinion that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513. According to Leonardo's contemporary, Giorgio Vasari, \"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\". Leonardo, later in his life, is said to have regretted \"never having completed a single work\". Circa 1504, Raphael executed a pen and ink sketch, today in the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns. Experts universally agree it is based on Leonardo's portrait of \"Mona Lisa\". Other later copies of the \"Mona Lisa\", such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the \"Mona Lisa\" in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut. However, as early as 1993, Zöllner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed. This was confirmed through a series of tests conducted in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version, while Frank Zöll\n\n[2] Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations: At the start of the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci was commissioned by Florentine nobleman Francesco del Giocondo to paint a portrait of his wife, Lisa. The painting is believed to have been undertaken between 1503 and 1506. Leonardo's portrait of \"Mona Lisa\" (\"Mona\" or \"Monna\" being the Italian honorific for \"Madame\") has been on display as part of the permanent collection at Paris' Louvre museum since 1797. It is also known as \"La Joconde\" in French and \"La Gioconda\" in Italian, and has been known by other names in the past. There is a new study setting the beginning of the Mona Lisa to an earlier date that thought before, pre-1478, contrary to Vasari's narrative. Replicas of \"Mona Lisa\" date back to the 16th century, including sculptures and etchings inspired by the painting. But even by the start of the 20th century, historian Donald Sassoon has stated, \"Mona Lisa\" was still \"just a well-respected painting by a famous old master, hanging in one of the great museums of the world.\" The image had yet to gain iconic status, and, Sassoon adds, was \"not even the most valued painting in the Louvre.\" The painting's theft on August 11, 1911, and the subsequent media frenzy surrounding the investigation and its recovery are contributing factors which ignited public interest and catapulted \"Mona Lisa\" to its current standing.\n\n[3] Isleworth Mona Lisa: According to Leonardo's early biographer Giorgio Vasari, Leonardo had started to paint \"Mona Lisa\" in 1503, but \"left it unfinished\". However, a fully finished painting of a \"certain Florentine lady\" surfaced again in 1517, shortly before Leonardo's death and in his private possession. The latter painting almost certainly is the one that now hangs in the Louvre. Based on this contradiction, supporters of the authenticity of the \"Isleworth Mona Lisa\" claim it is the unfinished \"Mona Lisa\", made at least partially by Leonardo, and the Louvre \"Mona Lisa\" a later version of it, made by Leonardo for his own use.\n\n[4] Mona Lisa's Revenge: Luke enters Clyde's painting for a competition and Clyde wins first prize. The prize is a trip to see the first showing of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" in Britain for Clyde and his class but Sarah Jane Smith is unaware of this as she and Luke have argued over the untidiness of his room. While the class is at the International Gallery with its director, Mr Harding, something causes the image of Mona Lisa to come to life and step out of the painting, and to replace herself with Harding's assistant, Miss Trupp. She also has the ability to make other people and objects from paintings come to life and able to make real people become part of paintings, and does this with some of the gallery staff. Believing the painting to be stolen, the gallery calls the police, who arrive. They have not been there long before the Mona Lisa also puts them into paintings. She removes a Sontaran blaster gun that Clyde has unwisely painted from his winning picture and commands the gallery's director to take her to find her 'brother'. Seeing the coverage of the apparent theft of the painting on television, Sarah Jane Smith arrives at the gallery and argues with the Mona Lisa to let the painting people come back to life. Instead, she puts Sarah Jane into a painting.\n\n[5] Mona Lisa: A version of the \"Mona Lisa\" known as the \"Isleworth Mona Lisa\" and also known as the \"Earlier Mona Lisa\" was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation. It is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The painting is claimed by a majority of experts to be mostly an original work of Leonardo dating from the early 16th century. Other experts, including Zöllner and Kemp, deny the attribution.\n\n[6] Roberto Vittori: The astronaut also had a painting of the artist George Pusenkoff titled \"Single Mona Lisa (1:1)\" with him and took photos with it on the International Space Station. It is the ultimate continuation of the project \"Mona Lisa Travels\" developed by Pusenkoff and could only be realized under difficult conditions. The authorities found the idea good in theory, but constantly put forward new reasons why the project was unrealizable. Only when George Pusenkoff wrote to the then Italian ambassador in Russia, Gianfranco Facco Bonetti, the possibility of realizing the idea arose. The connection between science and art, which was also important in Leonardo da Vinci's life, found here an \"actualization\" in the form of this journey of an image of Mona Lisa into space. For the action, Pusenkoff's painting was removed from the frame so that it could be rolled. On April 25, 2005, Vittori took the painting back to the Earth with him.\n\n[7] Mona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations: \"\"Mona Lisa\" (Two Times),\" \"Four \"Mona Lisa\"s,\" and \"Thirty Are Better Than One\" illustrate Warhol's method of silkscreening an image repetitively within the same work of art. Also in 1963, Fernando Botero – who had already painted \"\"Mona Lisa\", Age Twelve\" in 1959 – painted another, this time in what would become his trademark \"Boterismo\" style of rendering figures disproportionately \"plump\". \"Mona Lisa\" is also referenced in artwork by Contemporary art luminaries such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, adding to the veritable \"who's who\" list of artists putting their own spin on the portrait. A paint by numbers version of \"Mona Lisa\" accompanied artist Suzanne Lacy during her 1977 travelogue \"Travels with Mona\", documenting the painting process at landmark locations throughout Europe and Central America. From the 1980s through the end of the 20th Century, \"Mona Lisa\" continued to be the subject of re-interpretation among a new generation of emerging artists. Street artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, who came into prominence in the 1980s, created \"Federal Reserve Note\" and \"Apocalipse 7\", respectively, juxtaposing \"Mona Lisa\" within compositions suiting their styles. Ballpoint art pioneer Lennie Mace created his \"Mona a'la Mace\" replica in 1993, a ballpoint \"PENting\" commissioned by Pilot pen company and featured on CBS News. Artist Sophie Matisse, great-granddaughter of artist Henri Matisse, in her 1997 \"Monna Lisa (Be Back in Five Minutes)\" faithfully replicated the setting of the original painting, but omitted Mona Lisa from the scene; a concept she\n\n[8] I, Mona Lisa: I, Mona Lisa (UK title Painting Mona Lisa) is a historical novel by Jeanne Kalogridis about Lisa Gherardini, the model for Leonardo da Vinci's painting \"Mona Lisa\". Lisa is portrayed as a young Italian woman who learns about the murder of Giuliano de' Medici, the brother of Lorenzo de' Medici in the Pazzi conspiracy. Guiliano's murder casts a shadow, especially as one of the killers has not been found. She later falls in love with Giuliano's namesake, Lorenzo's son Giuliano in the aftermath of Girolamo Savonarola's uprising in the late 15th century.\n\n[9] Mona Lisa: Salvador Dalí, famous for his surrealist work, painted \"Self portrait as Mona Lisa\" in 1954. In 1963 following the painting's visit to the United States, Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple \"Mona Lisa\"s called \"Thirty are Better than One\", like his works of Marilyn Monroe (\"Twenty-five Coloured Marilyns\", 1962), Elvis Presley (1964) and Campbell's soup (1961–62). The \"Mona Lisa\" continues to inspire artists. A French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader has created versions on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using a mosaic style. A collection of \"Mona Lisa\" parodies may be found on YouTube. A 2014 \"New Yorker\" magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the \"Mona Lisa\" smile in an animation showing progressively maniacal smiles.\n\n[10] Isleworth Mona Lisa: Pulitzer argues in his book that Leonardo's contemporary Raphael made a sketch of this painting, probably from memory, after seeing it in Leonardo's studio in 1504 (the sketch is reproduced in Pulitzer's book; the book says that this sketch is at the Louvre). The Raphael sketch includes the two Greek columns that are not found in the Louvre's \"Mona Lisa\", but are found in the painting bought by Blaker. Pulitzer presents a few pages of art expert testimonials in his book; some of these experts seemed to believe that Leonardo was the painter, others felt the artist was somebody who worked in Leonardo's studio, and still others suggested that other artists may have done it. Supporters of the authenticity of the \"Isleworth Mona Lisa\" include art collector John Eyre, who argued that the bust, face, and hands are autographed.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Birthed from a rec.arts.comics cascade thread in April 1992 , it began as parody of the Legion of Super-Heroes (LSH), and other comic book superheroes. It featured characters like Cheesecake-Eater Lad (based on Matter-Eater Lad) and Super Apathy Lad defending the “Looniverse” from the likes of Lagneto (\"Lag\" spliced with \"Magneto\") and Doctor Killfile. Over time, it has evolved to include comedy, serious drama, character pieces and melodrama. With 181 stories posted in 2007, it is still active.\n\n[2] Legion of Net.Heroes: The headquarters of the LNH (called LNHHQ or LNHQ) is based in Net.ropolis and houses literally hundreds of members. The ever-expanding and out-of-control roster is one of the key conceits of the Legion. The team does lend itself nicely to several less unwieldy sub-groups.\n\n[3] Legion of Net.Heroes: The thread took off, spawning 115 (mostly) on-topic replies and a large and diverse pool of \"net.heroes\". On May 5, Steve Librande, no doubt growing tired of the thread, declared himself \"the ingenious Doctor Killfile\" , threatening to \"release the awesome force of my patented Kill-O-Ray, destroying all posts about you blithering Net.Heroes!!\"\n\n[4] Legion of Net.Heroes: With well over a thousand stories posted by over a hundred authors, the LNH is the predominant Usenet-based shared writing universe, and the most active of all the rec.arts.comics.creative universes. In May 1994, the estimated readership of alt.comics.lnh was 45,000.  The LNH has had writers from places as diverse as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, the Philippines, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand write for it. It is an \"open universe\"—— meaning that anyone can join, providing they abide by basic netiquette and respect the intellectual property of others —— and this openness is probably a key part of its continued life.\n\n[5] Legion of Net.Heroes: Legionnaires (also known as LNHers or LNH'rs) are given free room and board at LNHQ, plus a small allowance for purchases. How one gains membership into the LNH depends on the author writing the story: many stories feature characters rejected by the Legion who go off to form their own teams; other stories, featuring much less powerful characters, find those characters accepted instantly.\n\n[6] Legion of Net.Heroes: During the 1960s, the Net.astic Nine and the Challengers of the Abominable helped protect Net.ropolis and the Looniverse from destructive forces. The LNHer Sig.Lad was formerly a member of the Net.astic Nine. At the end of the 60's, a demon going by the name of Anti-Christ Lad controlled all of Net.ropolis including the LNH that was operating during this time period: The Legion of Net. Hippies. Self-Righteous Preacher, after joining with the Legion of Net.Hippies helped free the LNH from Anti-Christ Lad's control and sent him back to hell. A few Legion of Net. Hippies like Nudist Man, Super Apathy Lad, and Procrastination Boy remained with the current Legion.\n\n[7] Legion of Net.Heroes: Because the LNH is so large, to list all of its members in this article would be nearly impossible. What follows are a half-dozen characters whose names and concepts are the most essentially LNH-like.With the exception of Kid Kirby, all these characters occupy the large pool of characters who can be used freely by any writer, a possible reason for their popularity and the universe's general longevity.\n\n[8] Legion of Net.Heroes: Sometime in the 1920s or 1930s, a hero by the name of Boy Lad formed the Legion of Net. Heroes. During this time, he was the only member (Boy Lad Jr., his sidekick, wasn't allowed to join, due to the \"no sidekicks are allowed to join\" rule). No one knows what ultimately happened to him although someone who claimed to be him made an appearance in the \"Omaha Project\" series.\n\n[9] Legion of Net.Heroes: \"Retcon Hour\", a parody of Zero Hour, was the biggest planned crossover the LNH has ever had. At least fourteen writers took part in it, it touched both the PULP and NTB imprints, and also was linked with the Omaha Project series. During the chaos involved with transferring the Looniverse from alt.comics.lnh to rec.arts.comics.creative, two Time Crappers (post and pre-Cry. Sig), and wReamicus Maximus (wielding the all-powerful Ring of Retcon) washed the Looniverse over with a number of retcons in order to take control of it. Contraption Man was revealed to be the traitor he had been sent to stop. The resurrected and vindicated Myk-El became the consort of the RACCelestial Madonna. After the dust settled a few heroes, like Sig. Lad, left for a new life. And some new heroes, like the Legion of Occult Heroes, joined the LNH.\n\n[10] Legion of Net.Heroes: Many posters on rec.arts.comics.misc were annoyed by the LNH stories in what was primarily a discussion newsgroup.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Under the current government it has \"limited ability of citizens to change their government; increased reports of unlawful killings by security forces; government-sanctioned kidnappings; systematic torture of prisoners and detainees by security forces; life threatening conditions in prisons and detention facilities; impunity; arbitrary arrest, detention, and incommunicado detention; harassment and deportation of foreign residents with limited due process; judicial corruption and lack of due process; restrictions on the right to privacy; restrictions on freedom of speech and of the press; restrictions on the rights of assembly, association, and movement; government corruption; violence and discrimination against women; suspected trafficking in persons; discrimination against ethnic minorities; and restrictions on labor rights.\"\n\n[2] Equatorial Guinea–United States relations: The 2005 U.S. State Department Human Rights report on Equatorial Guinea cited shortcomings in basic human rights, political freedom, and labor rights. Equatorial Guinea attributes deficiencies to excessive zeal on the part of local authorities and promises better control and sensitization. U.S. Government policy involves constructive engagement with Equatorial Guinea to encourage an improvement in the human rights situation and positive use of petroleum funds directed toward the development of a working civil society. Equatoguineans visit the U.S. under programs sponsored by the U.S. Government, American oil companies, and educational institutions. The Ambassador's Self-Help Fund annually finances a number of small grassroots projects.\n\n[3] Corruption in Equatorial Guinea: There is no human-rights organization or anti-corruption group in Equatorial Guinea. The human-rights group EG Justice, which focuses on such issues in the country, is based abroad. Its executive director, Tutu Alicante, has lived in U.S. exile since age 19 and describes his country has having two realities. \"It has the highest GDP per capita but also the widest gap between rich and poor people.\" Despite being \"on paper the richest country on the continent on a per capita basis, on a par with many European nations,\" he told \"The Guardian\" in 2014, Equatorial Guinea has \"one of the highest income and standard of living disparities...The income per capita is one which should allow people to have the same access to healthcare etc. as most European nations. Then you look at the rates of access to water, access to adequate healthcare, access to education, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and you see that we are basically where the DRC is, where Haiti is. The gap between the income and the access to basic needs and rights is astronomical.\" The reason for the absence of human-rights or anti-corruption groups, he has explained, is that the country is small, and any institution, such as a church, \"that the government perceives as sufficiently powerful is immediately co-opted\" or \"completely undermined.\" Also, there are no labor unions, and any meeting of over five people requires a government permit.\n\n[4] Human trafficking in Equatorial Guinea: The Government of Equatorial Guinea demonstrated minimal law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking during the reporting period; the few measures taken were incidental to efforts to tighten border security and to control more closely immigration, emigration, and the issuance of work and travel permits to foreign migrants. Equatorial Guinea prohibits all forms of trafficking through its 2004 Law on the Smuggling of Migrants and Trafficking in Persons, which prescribes penalties of 10 to 15 years’ imprisonment, punishments which are sufficiently stringent. To date, no human trafficking cases were prosecuted under the relevant portion of this law. The government demonstrated no evidence of its forging partnerships with other governments in the region to investigate and prosecute trafficking cases. There was no evidence, however, of government officials’ involvement in or tolerance of trafficking. Under a government-funded contract with a foreign security training company, instructors conducted courses to improve the awareness of military and police officials on human trafficking issues. Two government officials – one from the Ministry of Defense and a sitting Supreme Court justice – assisted in the training. In December 2009, the government signed a new five-year contract with the foreign company that will address maritime security and include instruction on human rights and human trafficking issues.\n\n[5] Equatorial Guinea: The sovereign state totalitarian government is cited as having one of the worst human rights records in the world, consistently ranking among the \"worst of the worst\" in Freedom House's annual survey of political and civil rights. Reporters Without Borders ranks President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo among its \"predators\" of press freedom. Human trafficking is a significant problem; the 2012 U.S. Trafficking in Persons Report stated that Equatorial Guinea \"is a source and destination for women and children subjected to forced labor and forced sex trafficking.\" The report rates Equatorial Guinea as a government that \"does not fully comply with minimum standards and is not making significant efforts to do so.\"\n\n[6] Fabián Nsue: Fabián Nsue Nguema is the most prominent human-rights lawyer in Equatorial Guinea which, under Teodoro Obiang, has been referred to as one of the most repressive regimes in Africa. He is a member of Equatorial Guinea's only legal opposition party, Unión Popular (UP), which frequently denounces human rights violations, and of which he has served as secretary-general. He has defended a number of political prisoners in trials.\n\n[7] Corruption in Equatorial Guinea: In 2011, Freedom House put Equatorial Guinea in its \"worst of the worst\" category for governments that violate human rights and civil liberties, which also includes North Korea, Sudan, and Turkmenistan. In its 2014 world report, Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated: \"Corruption, poverty, and repression continue to plague Equatorial Guinea...Vast oil revenues fund lavish lifestyles for the small elite surrounding the president, while a large proportion of the population continues to live in poverty. Mismanagement of public funds and credible allegations of high-level corruption persist, as do other serious abuses, including arbitrary detention, secret detention, and unfair trials.\"\n\n[8] David T. Killion: In July 2012, Ambassador Killion issued a statement expressing U.S. opposition to UNESCO's decision to award the UNESCO-Equatorial Guinea International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences, which was controversially endowed by Equatorial Guinea. UNESCO's Director-General, Irina Bokova, joined Ambassador Killion in opposing the award; the U.S. considers Equatorial Guinea under President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo to be a dictatorship with an egregious record of human rights violations.\n\n[9] Human rights in Equatorial Guinea: The chart shows Equatorial Guinea's ratings since 1972 in the Freedom in the World reports, published annually by Freedom House. A rating of 1 is \"most free\" and 7 is \"least free\". Equatorial Guinea's stances on international human rights treaties are as follows:\n\n[10] Equatorial Guinea: Some of the motivations for Equatorial Guinea's membership pursuit into the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP) included access to several professional and academic exchange programs and facilitated cross-border circulation of citizens. The adoption of Portuguese as an official language was the primary requirement to apply for CPLP acceptance. In addition, the country was told it must adopt political reforms allowing effective democracy and respect for human rights. The national parliament discussed this law in October 2011.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

What was the song?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] True (Avicii album): Swedish producer Avicii had been making music since he began remixing and producing tracks in his own bedroom at the age of 18. He started life as a professional musician in 2007, and after numerous collaborations with other record producers and DJs, such as John Dahlbäck and David Guetta, Avicii reached international mainstream success with his 2011 single \"Levels\", which reached the top ten in over fifteen countries and topped the charts in Norway, Hungary and Sweden. Subsequent releases \"Silhouettes\", which charted in eleven countries, and \"I Could Be the One\", which charted in twenty-four countries, achieved similar popularity and sales before Avicii entered the recording studio in late 2012 to record a debut studio album to follow up his mainstream success.\n\n[2] Axwell &amp; Ingrosso: After performing at multiple events during the first half of 2018, notably at Ultra Miami 2018 (the festival which also saw their collaboration with Steve Angello, Swedish House Mafia reunited after a five year hiatus), the duo released house single \"Dancing Alone\" on 29 June 2018 featuring vocals from British singer RØMANS. The track's cover art displayed a picture of Paris Hilton which was used to promote the song through Instagram a day before its release. July and August 2018 saw the duo performing at music festivals including Tomorrowland as headliners for their fourth consecutive year. During the set they paid tribute to the late DJ Avicii by mixing his \"Wake Me Up\" with their \"Don't You Worry Child\", a song by the band which Avicii has previously stated to be one of his main influences. In August 2018, Axwell Λ Ingrosso announced that they would be going on hiatus in order to focus on the Swedish House Mafia reunion saying \"We felt it was time, and we missed it\". The three DJs announced that new music would be released in 2019 along with a Swedish House Mafia tour, with Steve Angello also confirming a show in Mexico and that Swedish House Mafia would play Tomorrowland 2019 \"by any means necessary\". Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso announced that they are not disbanded and will return some time in the future.\n\n[3] Stories (Avicii album): In July 2014, Avicii told \"Rolling Stone\" that he had worked on 70 songs for his next album and would include collaborations with Jon Bon Jovi, Billie Joe Armstrong, Chris Martin, Wyclef Jean, Serj Tankian and Matisyahu. Describing the album, Avicii said: \"It's going to be a lot more song-oriented.\" On 2 March 2015, Avicii performed live at Australia's Future Music Festival. A lot of songs were leaked onto the internet from Avicii's UMF 2015 set. These songs include \"Waiting for Love\", \"For a Better Day\", \"City Lights\" and \"Sunset Jesus\", leaked under the name \"Attack\". A complete track listing of the set can be found on Avicii's SoundCloud page.\n\n[4] True (Avicii album): Avicii performed at the 2013 Ultra Music Festival on March 22, 2013, revealing nearly forty minutes of new album material from \"True\", to which he received a mixed to negative response from critics, fans and media alike. The new material, which incorporated bluegrass and country music elements, and included live performances from Aloe Blacc, backed by a banjo and kazoo, saw a negative response at the festival, whose attendees criticized the DJ for bringing the experimental material to a high-profile electronic dance music festival. Some fans and following musicians also took to social media sites like Twitter to bash the performance. Dubstep/electro house musician Jake Stanczak, better known as Kill the Noise, tweeted: \"What are the similarities and differences between Avicii and Al Walser? Discuss.\" Producer Tommie Sunshine tweeted: \"I just listened to @Avicii's @ultramusic Festival Main Stage set; did he jump the #EDM shark?\"\n\n[5] Blessed (Avicii song): \"Blessed\" is a song by Swedish house producer Avicii (credited under the name Tom Hangs) featuring vocals from Shermanology. Like many of Avicii's early tracks this had been leaked on the internet between late 2010 to April 2011. The track was officially released on May 23, 2011 through Spinnin' Records. It was further released on March 6, 2012 in the United States, and then 3 months later in the United Kingdom on June 21, 2012.\n\n[6] Avicii: On 6 May 2015, Bergling released his rework of Nina Simone's version of \"Feeling Good\", composed in 1964 by the English songwriters Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. On 8 May 2015, Bergling previewed his song \"I'll Be Gone\" via episode 422 of Tiësto's Club Life Podcast which has a very similar instrumental to Liar Liar (Avicii by Avicii) albeit different vocals and chord progressions. It was leaked into the internet between 2013–2014 via the name \"Stars\" and is yet to be released. It also shares a similar drop to one of Bergling's ID's \"Black and Blue\". On 22 May 2015, Bergling premiered another single from \"Stories\", \"Waiting for Love\". The track was co-produced by fellow DJ and producer Martin Garrix, and featured vocals from Simon Aldred of Cherry Ghost. On 25 May 2015, Bergling previewed three old tracks on episode 36 of his LE7ELS podcast: \"Tracks of My Tears\", \"Sorry Mr. Atari\" and \"Time to Get lll\", all of which are songs that Bergling had made years ago. \"Tracks of My Tears\" is the original version of Bergling's \"All You Need is Love\". On 27 May 2015, it was confirmed by a Swedish newspaper through an interview with Bergling that his sophomore album \"Stories\" would be released in late 2015.\n\n[7] True (Avicii album): True is the debut studio album by Swedish electronic music producer Avicii, released on 13 September 2013 by PRMD Music and Island Records. Avicii said that sonically, the album would move away from his earlier house music sound on previous records by incorporating elements of other genres such as country music. \"True\" was preceded by the release of the Aloe Blacc-assisted \"Wake Me Up!\" that featured a rare Marantz Enhanced Digital Stereo audio track and topped several charts around the world, and \"You Make Me\", which features vocals from Swedish artist Salem Al Fakir.\n\n[8] The Nights: Furlong noted that he began writing the song as an ode to his father. The inspiration for the “pirate-y fight song” sound came to him while at a bar in Ireland. Furlong recalled: \"I had been going back and forth with Jordan and Gabe about this song idea that merged commercially sound rock music with the signature sound of an Irish drinking song. When I returned to Los Angeles we all went into the studio.\" Furlong sent the original idea, titled \"My Father Told Me\", to Arash Pournouri, Avicii's manager. Pournouri recognised an immediate draw to the track, saying that the song had that same sense of euphoria which characterises so much of Avicii's music. In an interview with Yahoo! Music, Pournouri said: \"It made absolute sense to work on it with Ras...[Avicii and I just needed] to make it more 'us' and that's what [we] did.\"\n\n[9] Silhouettes (Avicii song): \"Silhouettes\" is a song by Swedish house producer and DJ Avicii featuring vocals from Swedish singer Salem Al Fakir. The track was first released on 27 April 2012 in the United Kingdom. It had previously been leaked on the internet in early 2011, albeit with a different song pitch. Some music blogs erroneously posted \"Flash\" by Tatana and Scaloni.\n\n[10] Stories (Avicii album): On 22 May 2015, Avicii premiered his first single from \"Stories\", \"Waiting for Love\". The track was co-produced by DJ and producer Martin Garrix. Almost a month later, Avicii communicated through Twitter that he had finished the album after two years of work. On 4 August 2015, it was announced on iHeartMedia Summit that Avicii's next single from \"Stories\" was \"For a Better Day\", featuring singer Alex Ebert. On 28 August, he released his next two singles, the other being \"Pure Grinding\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWho were involved in Battle of Odawara?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Ōtawara Castle: The Ōtawara clan was a branch of the Nasu clan, and was one of the seven Gōzoku samurai bands of the Nasu region of northern Shimotsuke Province. In 1590, Ōtawara Harukiyo went against his Nasu overlord and pledged allegiance to Toyotomi Hideyoshi at the Battle of Odawara against the Odawara Hōjō clan, and was awarded a 7,000 \"koku\" holding. He later pledged his forces to Tokugawa Ieyasu and fought a rear-guard action against the Uesugi clan while Ieyasu was at the Battle of Sekigahara and gained another 5,000 \"koku\", which qualified him to the ranks of the daimyō.\n\n[2] Odawara: From the Ritsuryō system of the Nara period, the area became part of Ashigarashimo District of Sagami Province. It was divided into \"shōen\" during the Heian period, mostly controlled by the Hatano clan and its branches. During the Genpei War between the Heike clan and Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Battle of Ishibashiyama was fought near present-day Odawara. During the Sengoku period, Odawara developed as a castle town and capital of the domains of the later Hōjō clan, which covered most of the Kantō region. The Hōjō were defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Battle of Odawara in 1590, despite the impregnable reputation of Odawara Castle. The territory came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\n[3] Odawara Castle: During the Sengoku period, Odawara Castle had very strong defenses, as it was situated on a hill, surrounded by moats with water on the low side, and dry ditches on the hill side, with banks, walls and cliffs located all around the castle, enabling the defenders to repel attacks by Uesugi Kenshin in 1561 and Takeda Shingen in 1569. In 1587, the defences of the castle were greatly expanded by the Odawara Hōjō in anticipation of the coming conflict with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, during the Battle of Odawara in 1590, Hideyoshi forced the surrender of the Odawara Hōjō without storming the castle through a combination of a three-month siege and bluff. After ordering most of the fortifications destroyed, he awarded the holdings of the Odawara Hōjō to his leading general Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n\n[4] Ashikaga Domain: The Ashikaga clan which ruled Japan during the Muromachi period established a branch government at their ancestral homeland of Ashikaga \"shōen\" in Shimotsuke to govern the Kantō region. However, by the late Sengoku period, this branch of the Ashikaga were very much weakened by the constant battles against the Uesugi clan, Takeda clan and Odawara Hojo clan, and were eventually dispossessed after the 1590 Battle of Odawara.\n\n[5] Odawara Castle: Odawara was a stronghold of the Doi clan during the Kamakura period, and a fortified residence built by their collateral branch, the Kobayakawa clan stood on the approximate site of the present castle. After the Uesugi Zenshū Revolt of 1416, Odawara came under the control of the Omori clan of Suruga. They were in turn defeated by Ise Moritoki of Izu, founder of the Odawara Hōjō clan in 1495. Five generations of the Odawara Hōjō clan improved and expanded on the fortifications of Odawara Castle as the center of their domains, which encompassed most of the Kantō region.\n\n[6] Hosokawa Tadaoki: Tadaoki was present on Hideyoshi's side in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute (1584) and the Odawara Campaign (1590), where he took part in the siege of Nirayama (Izu Province) and later joined the main army outside Odawara. During the 1590s he became friends with Tokugawa Ieyasu (who had lent him money to assist in some debts owed Toyotomi Hidetsugu) and in 1600 sided with him against Ishida Mitsunari. In July Ishida had attempted to gain some leverage over those leaning towards Ieyasu by taking as hostages all those whose families were in Osaka Castle. This happened to include Tadaoki's wife – who was by now a Christian, baptized \"Gracia\". To avoid capture, Gracia ordered a servant to kill her and set fire to their quarters. While there is little reason to believe that Hosokawa was emotionally scarred by the incident, it was considered an appalling act of trickery, and served to drive Tadaoki – among others – into Ieyasu's camp.\n\n[7] Ikoma Chikamasa: In 1566, he became a retainer of Oda Nobunaga when he attacked Mino Province. He worked under Hashiba Hideyoshi (Toyotomi Hideyoshi) from then on, and was involved in various battles such as the Battle of Nagashino, the battle against Ishiyama Hongan-ji and the battle against the Saika party at Kii Province. In 1582, he served Hideyoshi after Nobunaga died, and was active in several battles such as the Battle of Yamazaki, the Battle of Shizugatake, the Siege of Odawara, and the Battle of Bunroku. He was given lands in Sanuki Province yielding 171,800 \"koku\" of rice because of his service. In Hideyoshi's last years, Ikoma Chikamasa, Nakamura Kazuuji, and Horio Yoshiharu were appointed to the position of \"chūrō\" under Toyotomi.\n\n[8] Katakura Kagetsuna: Kagetsuna fought in most of Masamune's major battles, including the Battle of Hitodoribashi in 1585, Kōriyama in 1588, in 1589, Odawara in 1590, the Korean campaign in 1590, and Sekigahara in 1600. He also assisted in the Date clan's administrative duties, serving as castle warden of Nihonmatsu Castle, lord of Ōmori Castle, Watari Castle, and others. Kagetsuna played a key role in the survival of the Date clan in 1590, by recommending that Masamune submit to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Odawara Campaign. Following the Odawara Campaign, Hideyoshi granted Kagetsuna the 50,000 \"koku\" fief of Tamura. This made Kagetsuna a daimyō in his own right; however, soon after taking possession of the fief, he returned it, in a show of loyalty to his master.\n\n[9] Horio Yoshiharu: Horio was involved in various battles such as the Battle of Yamazaki and shined as a retainer of Hideyoshi. At the Battle of Shizugatake in 1583, he killed Saito Toshikazu after he attempt to scroll past Hideyoshi's lines. In 1590, Hideyoshi awarded him 120,000 koku at Hamamatsu, Tōtōmi Province because of the credit for the siege of Odawara. Horio Yoshiharu, Nakamura Kazuuji and Ikoma Chikamasa were appointed the three \"chūrō\" by Hideyoshi in his last years, and participated in the Toyotomi administration.\n\n[10] Ōkubo Tadayo: He also fought in the Battle of Nagashino (1575). Nicknamed , he rose to become considered one of Ieyasu's sixteen generals and was entrusted with Futamata Castle in Tōtōmi Province. Upon the assassination of Oda Nobunaga in 1582, Ieyasu expanded his rule into Shinano Province, with Ōkubo Tadayo assigned to managing the campaign from his base at Komoro Castle. After the Battle of Odawara (1590), Ieyasu was transferred from the Tōkai region to the provinces of the Kantō region. Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered that Ōkubo Tadayo be raised at that point to the status of daimyō, and was assigned the \"fief\" of Odawara, with an income of 45,000 \"koku\". He continued to rule in Odawara until his death in 1594, and was succeeded by his son, Ōkubo Tadachika\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was produced in 1970, directed by Gilles Grangier and broadcast in 1971. The series starred the German actor Amadeus August as the protagonist and the French actress Marie-France Boyer as Isabelle de Croye. The series was based on Sir Walter Scott's in 1823 published novel \"Quentin Durward\". It concerns a Scottish soldier who serves French King Louis XI (1423-1483) while the King has to overcome the schemes of his rival Charles the Bold and Jean Balue. The TV series kept close to the classic novel and was often shot at historic French locations. The French version consists of 7 instalments of 52 minutes each, while the dubbed German version had 13 episodes of about 25 minutes apiece. Both versions have been made available on DVD.\n\n[2] Quentin Durward (TV series): In a monastery in Scotland on the day of an ordination to the priesthood, Quentin Durward, a dashing young man of noble background, is about to be consecrated. The monks beseech him to devote his life to God in order to save his life. He is reminded that he would have been dead already if it hadn't been for the monks and their solemn promise to make him one of them. By listening to the monks while they are berating young Quentin, the audience learns that Quentin's clan has been wiped out as the result of a feud. The hostile clan who killed Quentin's kin is determined to put an end to the bloodline one way or the other. Either he takes the oath to live in celibacy or he won't be spared any longer after all. While they raid the monastery he manages to escape his pursuers and to reach the English Channel. He heads for France because his only living relative, his uncle Lludovic Cunningham (played by Noël Roquevert), serves as a member of the Scottish Guard. At the same time Isabelle de Croye, who is also an orphan, secretly leaves the Kingdom of Burgundy in order to elude an arranged marriage and find shelter in France too. They run into each other, fall in love and after many adventures they marry in the Abbey Notre Dame of Morienval.\n\n[3] The Adventures of Quentin Durward: The Adventures of Quentin Durward, known also as Quentin Durward, is a British-American 1955 historical film released by MGM. It was directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The screenplay was by Robert Ardrey, adapted by George Froeschel from the novel \"Quentin Durward\" by Sir Walter Scott.\n\n[4] Quentin Durward: \"Quentin Durward\" was composed in a remarkably short space of time. After carrying out some preparatory research towards the end of 1822 Scott began writing in January 1823 and supplied the finishing sentences in response to a request from his coadjutor James Ballantyne on 3 May. His principal source was the \"Mémoires\" of Philippe de Comines, but as usual he adapts historical facts freely in the construction of his fiction: most notably the murder of the Bishop of Liège occurs 14 years before its historical date, and Orleans and his future wife Joan appear as adults rather than young children. He was also inspired by manuscript material deriving from continental journeys by his friend James Skene of Rubislaw.\n\n[5] Anne of Geierstein: In May 1823, when Scott had just finished \"Quentin Durward\" he expressed his intention to 'try in a continuation' the deaths of Charles of Burgundy & Louis XI. Five years later he began \"Anne of Geierstein\" which ends with Charles's death at the battle of Nancy and Louis in the background picking up the territorial spoils. The novel was written between September 1828 and April 1829. Scott was able to draw on his historical sources for \"Quentin Durward\", notably the \"Mémoires\" of Philippe de Comines. He also made use of modern studies of Switzerland, Provence, and the Secret Tribunal, of the recently published history of the Dukes of Burgundy by Barante, and of manuscript material deriving from continental journeys by his friend James Skene of Rubislaw.\n\n[6] The Adventures of Quentin Durward: Meanwhile, the Duke of Burgundy arrests Louis when he comes to continue peace negotiations, accusing him of orchestrating the murder of the bishop. However, Quentin arrives and exonerates the King, providing as proof De la Marck's severed head. Out of gratitude (and in France's best interests), Louis tricks Charles into letting Isabelle decide whom she will marry. Quentin has received news that his uncle has died, so he is free to follow his heart.In 1951, MGM filmed an adaptation of \"Ivanhoe\" by Sir Walter Scott in Britain, starring Robert Taylor and produced by Pandro S. Berman. The studio was so pleased with the results that even before the film was released they were looking at a follow up for Taylor, and \"Quentin Durward\" was suggested. The project became a certainty when \"Ivanhoe\" became one of the biggest hits of Taylor's career. He was scheduled to make the film after completing \"Knights of the Round Table\".\n\n[7] The Adventures of Quentin Durward: In 1465, honorable but penniless Scottish knight Quentin Durward (Robert Taylor) agrees to go to France to find out if the beautiful young heiress, Isabelle, Countess of Marcroy (Kay Kendall), would be a suitable wife for his aged uncle (that is, if she is as rich as is claimed). The marriage has been arranged by Charles, Duke of Burgundy (Alec Clunes) for his ward to cement an alliance with Scotland, but she wants nothing to do with it, so she runs away and seeks the protection of Charles' great rival, Louis XI (Robert Morley), King of France. Quentin pursues and manages to foil an attempted robbery by brigands under the command of Count William de La Marck (Duncan Lamont), though Isabelle continues on her way unaware of her protector's identity.\n\n[8] Donald Cotton: Tosh and Wiles were so pleased with his first script that Donald Cotton was quickly asked to submit another idea for \"Doctor Who\" and on 30 November 1965 Cotton was commissioned to write \"The Gunfighters\". The idea was that this would, again, be a humorous take on the historical story; this time, the target would be the American Wild West (a setting which William Hartnell would later claim to have suggested), and specifically the infamous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which took place on 26 October 1881. Eschewing detailed historical research, Cotton opted to hew closer to the version of the Gunfight which had passed into contemporary mythology, with Wyatt Earp as a stolid enforcer of the law and Doc Holliday as a rascally anti-hero. Once more, Cotton's script played fast and loose with other elements of true Wild West history.\n\n[9] Quentin Durward: The reviews of \"Quentin Durward\" were mostly favourable, rating it among the best of the Waverley Novels, though there were a few dissenting voices. Particularly appreciated were the witty Introduction, the contrasting depictions of Louis and Charles, the striking incidents and descriptions, the control of the plot (though some thought it thin), and the vivid presentation of an interesting and unfamiliar period. The most common adverse criticisms were that historical analysis was too prominent, threatening to overpower the fiction, and that the female characters were weak. Sales in Britain were initially rather slow, perhaps because it came too quickly after Peveril of the Peak, but it was an immediate hit on the Continent.\n\n[10] Quentin Durward: Ch. 8 (31) The Interview: In an interview with Isabelle arranged by Crawford, Quentin asks her to tell Charles only what she knows about Louis from personal experience, to avoid inflaming the situation.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

Her clients include the likes of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, in his fight against extradition; the former prime minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko; and Egyptian-Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy. She is married to American actor George Clooney.\n\n[2] Amal Clooney: During the 1980s Lebanese Civil War, Alamuddin's family left Lebanon and settled in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. She learned English watching her favourite show \"The Facts of Life,\" and was two years old at the time. Her father, Ramzi Alam Uddin, from a Lebanese Druze family from Baakline (a village in the Chouf district), received his MBA degree at the American University of Beirut and was the owner of COMET travel agency. He returned to Lebanon in 1991. Her mother, Bariaa Miknass, from a family of Sunni Muslims from Tripoli in Northern Lebanon, is a foreign editor of the Pan-Arab newspaper \"al-Hayat\" and a founder of the public relations company International Communication Experts, which is part of a larger company that specialises in celebrity guest bookings, publicity photography, and event promotion.\n\n[3] Amal Clooney: Amal Alamuddin was born in Beirut, Lebanon. Her first name is derived from Arabic أمل \"\", meaning \"hope\".\n\n[4] George Clooney: Clooney married actress Talia Balsam in 1989; they divorced in 1993. Clooney became engaged to British-Lebanese human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin on April 28, 2014. In July 2014, Clooney publicly criticized the British tabloid newspaper the \"Daily Mail\" after it claimed his fiancée's mother opposes their marriage on religious grounds. When the tabloid apologized for its false story, Clooney refused to accept the apology. He called the paper \"the worst kind of tabloid. One that makes up its facts to the detriment of its readers.\" On August 7, 2014, Clooney and Alamuddin obtained marriage licenses at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea of the United Kingdom. Alamuddin and Clooney were officially married on September 27, 2014, at Ca' Farsetti. They were married by Clooney's friend Walter Veltroni, the former mayor of Rome. In 2015, Clooney and Alamuddin adopted a rescue dog, a bassett hound named Millie, from the San Gabriel Valley Humane Society. On February 9, 2017, it was reported by the CBS talk show, \"The Talk\", that Amal was pregnant, and that they were expecting twins. On June 6, 2017, Amal gave birth to a daughter, Ella, and a son, Alexander.\n\n[5] Chet Allen (actor, born 1939): Allen was born in Chillicothe, Ohio, and later moved to Columbus, Ohio. At the time he was selected as Amahl, Allen was a soprano member of Columbus Boychoir, founded in Columbus, Ohio. The music boarding school relocated in 1950 to Princeton, New Jersey, and in 1980 was renamed the American Boychoir School. Allen also reprised his role as Amahl in theatre in April 1952 with the New York City Opera, conducted by young Thomas Schippers.\n\n[6] Amal Clooney: Clooney partnered with the Aurora Humanitarian Initiative in beginning the Amal Clooney Scholarship, which was created to send one female student from Lebanon to the United World College Dilijan each year, to enroll in a two-year International Baccalaureate (IB) programme.\n\n[7] Amal Clooney: Amal Clooney is fluent in English, French and conversational Arabic. Her father is a Lebanese Druze and her mother is a Lebanese Sunni Muslim. Some reports have described Clooney as a Druze. However, it is unlikely that she considers herself a part of the religion in any capacity, due to the Druze restriction on exogamy, her mother's Muslim faith, and her marriage to non-Druze George Clooney. She has not publicly discussed her religion, but her husband said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that Amal Clooney is \"nondenominational...not religious at all\".\n\n[8] Amal Clooney: Clooney is the president of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, which she co-founded with her husband George Clooney in late 2016 to advance justice in courtrooms, communities, and classrooms around the world.\n\n[9] Amal Clooney: Amal Clooney has three siblings—one sister, Tala, and two half-brothers, Samer and Ziad, from her father's first marriage.\n\n[10] Al McCoy (boxer): McCoy was born Alexander Rudolph in Rosenhayn, Deerfield Township, New Jersey, on October 23, 1894. As a child, he moved with his family to Brownsville, Brooklyn, where his father found work as a kosher butcher. At the age of only fourteen, he helped make ends meet by filling in as a boxer for preliminary fights at local boxing clubs, when the scheduled boxers failed to show.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was released under license by Nemo Studios to Angel Records. The album combines pieces written by classical and modern composers. It is the 17th top-selling classical album of the 2000s in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and is Brightman's second highest seller in the country after her 1997 release \"Timeless/Time to Say Goodbye\". Aside from the US, the album experienced its strongest sales in Asia, where it received a quintuple platinum certification in Taiwan and earned Brightman's first Gold award in Japan.\n\n[2] La Luna (Holger Czukay album): La Luna is an album by Holger Czukay, released on June 13, 2000. The album originally consisted of one extended work, \"La Luna\", recorded four years earlier and described as \"an electronic night ceremony\". According to Czukay, It seems to me that certain types of albums almost create themselves. In such cases the composer is merely the conduit for a pre-existing energy waiting to be transformed into sound. My experience with La Luna was very much like that. The album […] is in many ways a product of something similar to the automatic writing techniques of the Surrealists. I had purchased a new sampler and began experimenting with the machine without reference to the instruction manual and filled the brain of the machine to its full capacity with 'sonic memories'. In the late hours of the evening the machine came to life and spoke! The recording you hear is the transcript of this transcendental conversation between man and machine. In 2007 the album was reissued with a more elaborate CD cover design and included an additional shorter remix track.\n\n[3] Luna Sea (Luna Sea album): Luna Sea is the self-titled debut album by Japanese rock band Luna Sea, released on April 21, 1991 by Extasy Records. It sold over 30,000 copies by July 1992. The album was remastered and re-released by Universal Music Group on December 19, 2007. In 2011, after reuniting the previous year, Luna Sea re-recorded the whole album and released it on March 16, 2011 by their label at the time, HPQ.\n\n[4] Luna Sea (Luna Sea album): At a sold-out February 11, 1991 concert at Meguro Rock-May-Kan, Lunacy were discovered by X Japan guitarist hide and were signed by X Japan co-founder Yoshiki to his independent record label Extasy Records. The band changed their name from Lunacy to Luna Sea and took part in the label's sold out Nuclear Fusion Tour in March with Gilles de Rais and Sighs of Love Potion. On the tour, a 3-track sample CD including a song from each band was freely distributed, to which they contributed a short sample of \"Precious\". Their self-titled debut album was released on April 21, 1991. In support of the record, they held their first nationwide tour Under the New Moon, which started on June 13 and was separated into two legs or \"Episodes\" with a final concert held on September 19. However, a third leg of 17 shows was performed from October 13 to December 30.\n\n[5] The Days of Our Nights: The album was recorded as Luna's fifth LP for Elektra Records, a part of the Warner Bros. Records music family. Because of the major label consolidations that occurred in the late 1990s, many alternative rock bands signed to major labels were dropped in this time period, including Luna. In an ironic twist, the album was picked up by Jericho records, a subsidiary of Sire Records, which is also part of the Warner Bros. Records family. It would, however, prove to be the final album by the band to receive major-label distribution.\n\n[6] La Luna: Live in Concert: La Luna: Live in Concert is a live concert recording by Sarah Brightman, inspired by her \"La Luna\" album. The performance in Sunrise, Florida was recorded in fall 2000 and has been released on DVD and VHS in spring 2001. Brightman performs her 1997 hit \"There for Me\" with singer Josh Groban. Special features included are the music video for \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\", a multipart documentary covering the making of the \"La Luna\" album and tour, a behind-the-scenes tour documentary, an interview, and an interactive tour map.\n\n[7] Emilio de Gogorza: De Gogorza recorded prodigiously for the Victor Talking Machine Company. His records display the intelligence and sensitivity of his singing, as well as a polished vocal technique. Victor released many recordings not only under his own name but under various aliases such as Carlos Francisco and Herbert Goddard. He used these pseudonyms for records issued on Victor's lower priced black label instead of the premium priced Red Seal label for which he usually recorded. In addition to recording, he also served as an early A&R man for Victor. He helped persuade other well-known opera singers to record for the company, including Enrico Caruso who signed with the label in 1904. Curiously, De Gogorza and Caruso made only one published recording together, a Spanish song entitled \"A la luz de la luna\" (\"In the moonlight\") in 1918. In 1928, De Gogorza recorded the song again, with tenor Tito Schipa.\n\n[8] Rick Berlin: A Yale graduate, Berlin has been writing and performing a distinctly theatrical form of rock and roll since the early 1970s. He achieved much of his early success with Orchestra Luna, whose eponymous debut was released on Epic Records in 1974. \"Orchestra Luna,\" co-produced by Rupert Holmes, captured many of the dramatic eccentricities that made the band a renowned live act, particularly on \"(You Gotta Have) Heart\" (a cover of the \"Damn Yankees\" tune). That year, WBCN started an annual tradition of playing this particular cut for the Boston Red Sox on the baseball team's opening day. Album sales proved disappointing to Epic, though the tour for the record was successful (including an opening slot for Roxy Music). The label dropped the band, but Berlin (then Kinscherf) continued to compose and perform with Orchestra Luna, becoming a part of the CBGB scene in New York City and playing with acts like Talking Heads and The Ramones. In 1976, Orchestra Luna was offered a recording contract from Sire Records, which they turned down. Unfortunately, they found themselves unable to find a better offer. In 1978, the band's name was changed to, simply, Luna. A hit single, \"Hooray For Hollywood\" was released, but litigation with a former producer prevented a full album from following.\n\n[9] Luna-C: To have more control over his music, Howell bought a studio and founded Kniteforce Records. The label's first release, \"The Luna-C Project 1 – Edge of Madness\", was produced by Luna-C but engineered by Austin Reynolds at Suburban Base Records as Howell hadn't learned how to record. The second release, \"The Luna-C Project 2 – Mission of Madness\", was entirely produced by Luna-C in his studio.\n\n[10] Una luna de miel en la mano: \"Una luna de miel en la mano\" was the last song written for \"Locura\". Virus had already recorded seven tracks for the album, but the label demanded that eight was the minimum. It was composed on a plane as the band headed to New York City, where they worked on the album's mixing. In 2015, Marcelo Moura recalled: \"As we had recorded in Buenos Aires, when we travelled to New York to mix, on the plane (when you could still smoke in a sector) we went with Julio and Federico [Moura] with a guitar and we made a base, we composed the missing song. [...] It was something very improvised and is, nothing more and nothing less, the most famous track in Virus' history.\" Having arrived to New York, Federico's friend Eduardo Acosta wrote the song's lyrics. He would later also write the lyrics for \"Encuentro en el río musical\", a song from the band's 1987 album \"Superficies de placer\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Ion suppression is not strictly a problem unless interfering compounds elute at the same time as the analyte of interest. In cases where ion suppressing species do co-elute with an analyte, the effects on the important analytical parameters including precision, accuracy and limit of detection (analytical sensitivity) can be extensive, severely limiting the validity of an assay's results.\n\n[2] Ion suppression in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: At its inception as a tool of analytical chemistry, LC-MS/MS spread rapidly and indeed continues to do so in (amongst others) bioanalytical fields, owing to its selectivity for analytes of interest. Indeed, in many cases this selectivity can lead to a misconception that it is always possible to simplify or (on occasion) almost completely remove the necessity for extensive sample preparation. Consequently, LC-MS/MS has become the analytical tool of choice for bioanalysis owing to its impressive sensitivity and selectivity over other, more conventional chromatographic approaches. However, during and after uptake by bioanalytical laboratories world wide, it became apparent that there were inherent problems with detection of relatively small analyte concentrations in the complex sample matrices associated with biological fluids (e.g. blood and urine).\n\n[3] Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: LC-MS is widely used in the field of bioanalysis and is specially involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. As long as there are no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.\n\n[4] Ion suppression in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: Put simply, ion suppression describes the adverse effect on detector response due to reduced ionisation efficiency for analyte(s) of interest, resulting from the presence of species in the sample matrix which compete for ionisation, or inhibit efficient ionisation in other ways. Use of MS/MS as a means of detection may give the impression that there are no interfering species present, since no chromatographic impurities are detected. However, species which are not isobaric may still have an adverse effect on the sensitivity, accuracy and precision of the assay owing to suppression of the ionisation of the analyte of interest.\n\n[5] Mass spectrometry: Similar to gas chromatography MS (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS or LC-MS) separates compounds chromatographically before they are introduced to the ion source and mass spectrometer. It differs from GC-MS in that the mobile phase is liquid, usually a mixture of water and organic solvents, instead of gas. Most commonly, an electrospray ionization source is used in LC-MS. Other popular and commercially available LC-MS ion sources are atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and atmospheric pressure photoionization. There are also some newly developed ionization techniques like laser spray.\n\n[6] Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: In addition to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers the separated components from the LC column into the MS ion source. The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under vacuum (around 10 torr). Thus, it is not possible to directly pump the eluate from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the chemical identity of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system. Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI).These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.\n\n[7] Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: ESI interface for LC-MS systems was developed by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface can be used for the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized at the tip of the capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged. The use of 1–3 mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 μl/min range.\n\n[8] Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry: The moving-belt interface (MBI) was developed in 1977. This interface consisted of an endless moving belt receiving the LC column effluent. On the belt, the solvent was evaporated by gently heating and efficiently exhausting the solvent vapors under reduced pressure in two vacuum chambers. After removing the liquid phase, the analytes would desorb from the belt and migrate to the MS ion source to be analysed. MBI was successfully used for LC-MS applications between 1978 and 1990 because it allowed coupling of LC to MS devices using EI, CI, and fast-atom bombardment (FAB) ion sources. The most common MS systems connected by MBI interfaces to LC columns were magnetic sector and quadropole instruments. MBI interfaces for LC-MS allowed MS to be widely applied in the analysis of drugs, pesticides, steroids, alkaloids, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This interface is no longer used because of its mechanical complexity and the difficulties associated to belt renewal. Particle beam interfaces took over the wide applications of MBI for LC-MS in 1988.\n\n[9] Electron ionization: Two recent approaches for coupling capillary scale liquid chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (LC-EI-MS) can be incorporated for the analysis of various samples. These are capillary-scale EI-based LC/MS interface and direct-EI interface. In the capillary EI the nebulizer has been optimized for linearity and sensitivity. The direct-EI interface is a miniaturized interface for nano- and micro-HPLC in which the interfacing process takes place in a suitably modified ion source. Superior sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility can be obtained because the elution from the column is completely transferred into the ion source. Using these two interfaces electron ionization can be successfully incorporated for the analysis of small and medium-sized molecules with various polarities. The most common applications for these interfaces in LC-MS are environmental applications such as gradient separations of the pesticides, carbaryl, propanil, and chlorpropham using a reversed phase, and pharmaceutical applications such as separation of four anti-inflammatory drugs, diphenyldramine, amitryptyline, naproxen, and ibuprofen.\n\n[10] Two-dimensional chromatography: Common solvents used in normal or reversed phase LC such as water, acetonitrile, and methanol are all compatible with ESI, yet it should be noted that a LC grade solvent may not be suitable for MS. Furthermore, buffers containing inorganic ions should be avoided as they may contaminate the ion source. Nonetheless, the problem can be resolved by 2D LC-MS, as well as other various issues including analyte coelusion and UV detection responses.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Types of legal evidence include testimony, documentary evidence, and physical evidence. The parts of a legal case which are not in controversy are known, in general, as the \"facts of the case.\" Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a trier of fact for the other issues of a case. Evidence and rules are used to decide questions of fact that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the legal burden of proof relevant to the case. Evidence in certain cases (e.g. capital crimes) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case.\n\n[2] Evidence: Presenting evidence before the court differs from the gathering of evidence in important ways. Gathering evidence may take many forms; presenting evidence that tend to prove or disprove the point at issue is strictly governed by rules. Failure to follow these rules leads to any number of consequences. In law, certain policies allow (or require) evidence to be excluded from consideration based either on indicia relating to reliability, or broader social concerns. Testimony (which tells) and exhibits (which show) are the two main categories of evidence presented at a trial or hearing. In the United States, evidence in federal court is admitted or excluded under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n\n[3] Uhuru Kenyatta: On 8 October 2014, Kenyatta appeared before the ICC in The Hague. He was called to appear at the ICC \"status conference\" when the prosecution said evidence needed to go ahead with a trial was being withheld. In a speech to the Kenyan parliament Kenyatta said that he was going to The Hague in a personal capacity — not as president of the country — so as not to compromise the sovereignty of Kenyans. Kenyatta did not speak in court, but denied the charges in comments to journalists as he left the court to catch a flight back home. \"We as Kenyans, we know where we came from, we know where we are going, and nobody will tell us what to do,\" he said. The judges adjourned the hearings and charges were dropped on 13 March 2015.\n\n[4] The Evidence (TV series): \"The Evidence\" is a character-driven police procedural revolving around a San Francisco Police Department inspector forlorn over the murder of his wife. His best friend and partner provides some comic relief. Each episode begins with a voice-over and the presentation of the evidence for the episode's particular crime. The evidence is presented as though it is puzzle pieces and inviting the viewer to 'play along' in solving the mystery. As the story progresses the characters discover the evidence shown to the viewer at the start of the episode. The inspectors are aided by Dr. Sol Goldman, the medical examiner. The multi-episode story arch involves Inspector Cole investigating the murder of his wife Julia.\n\n[5] Better Angels (FlashForward): Mark shares some information with Wedeck about the hydra painting he saw in his vision and shows how it's connected with Dyson Frost. Mark also tells him the information he got about Dyson Frost. Mark heads home to have lunch with Olivia, where they discuss where they can move to get away from everything bad that could happen. Mark tells Olivia that they still need to know what Charlie saw in her vision, because she told Mark \"D. Gibbons is a bad man\". That night, Olivia finally convinces Charlie to tell her what she saw in her vision. Charlie tells her that she gave Dylan a cookie and they overhear his dad saying D. Gibbons is a liar. Dylan writes out \"D. Gibbons is a bad man\" on the refrigerator, saying that bad people lie. Charlie hears some fireworks go off, she goes to the back door, and sees Vogel telling another man \"Mark Benford is dead\". Olivia reveals what she heard to Mark, and when Olivia decides to leave the house that night, Mark tells her he can't because there's gonna be another blackout and he needs to see it through, meaning he needs the flashforwards to come true to see what he saw come true.\n\n[6] Murder of Mona Tinsley: The jury took just 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid reference to Nodder's refusal to testify at this trial, stating: \"Nobody knows what has become of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word.\" In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: \"What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as I have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy of 5 January and 6 January, I will keep you in custody.\" He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.\n\n[7] Evidence (law): Hearsay is one of the largest and most complex areas of the law of evidence in common-law jurisdictions. The default rule is that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Hearsay is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. A party is offering a statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted if the party is trying to prove that the assertion made by the declarant (the maker of the out-of-trial statement) is true. For example, prior to trial Bob says, \"Jane went to the store.\" If the party offering this statement as evidence at trial is trying to prove that Jane actually went to the store, the statement is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, at both common law and under evidence codifications such as the Federal Rules of Evidence, there are dozens of exemptions from and exceptions to the hearsay rule.\n\n[8] Masei: The Gemara cited the Torah's requirement for corroborating witnesses to support the Mishnah's prohibition of circumstantial evidence in capital cases. The Mishnah reported that they admonished witnesses in capital cases not to testify based on conjecture (that is, circumstantial evidence) or hearsay, for the court would scrutinize the witnesses' evidence by cross-examination and inquiry. The Gemara reported that the Rabbis taught that the words \"based on conjecture\" in the Mishnah meant that the judge told the witness that if the witness saw the defendant running after the victim into a ruin, and the witness pursued the defendant and found the defendant with bloody sword in hand and the victim writhing in agony, then the judge would tell the witness that the witness saw nothing (and did not actually witness a murder). It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach said that he once did see a man pursuing his fellow into a ruin, and when Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach ran after the man and saw him, bloody sword in hand and the murdered man writhing, Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach exclaimed to the man, \"Wicked man, who slew this man? It is either you or I! But what can I do, since your blood (that is, life) does not rest in my hands, for it is written in the Torah (in ) 'At the mouth of two witnesses ... shall he who is to die be put to death'? May He who knows one's thoughts (that is, God) exact vengeance from him who slew his fellow!\" The Gemara reported that before they moved from the place, a serpent bit the murderer and he died.\n\n[9] Shofetim (parsha): The \"Gemara\" cited the Torah's requirement for corroborating witnesses in to support the Mishnah's prohibition of circumstantial evidence in capital cases. The Mishnah reported that they admonished witnesses in capital cases not to testify based on conjecture (that is, circumstantial evidence) or hearsay, for the court would scrutinize the witnesses' evidence by cross-examination and inquiry. The \"Gemara\" reported that the Rabbis taught that the words \"based on conjecture\" in the Mishnah meant that the judge told the witness that if the witness saw the defendant running after the victim into a ruin, and the witness pursued the defendant and found the defendant with bloody sword in hand and the victim writhing in agony, then the judge would tell the witness that the witness saw nothing (and did not actually witness a murder).

It is either you or I! But what can I do, since your blood (that is, life) does not rest in my hands, for it is written in the Torah (in ) 'At the mouth of two witnesses . . . shall he who is to die be put to death'? May He who knows one's thoughts (that is, God) exact vengeance from him who slew his fellow!\" The \"Gemara\" reported that before they moved from the place, a serpent bit the murderer and he died.\n\n[10] Thomas Gilovich: Gilovich condensed his academic research in judgement and decision making into a popular book, \"How We Know What Isn't So\". Writing in \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Carl Sagan called it \"a most illuminating book\" that \"shows how people systematically err in understanding numbers, in rejecting unpleasant evidence, in being influenced by the opinions of others. We're good in some things, but not in everything. Wisdom lies in understanding our limitations.\" Reviewing the book for \"The New York Times\", George Johnson wrote, \"Over time, the ability to infer rules about the way the world works from skimpy evidence confers a survival advantage, even if much of the time the lessons are wrong. From evolution's standpoint, it is better to be safe than sorry.\" In an interview, Gilovich summarized the thesis of \"How We Know What Isn't So\" as people \"thinking we really have the evidence for things, [that] the world is telling us something, but in fact the world is telling us something a little more complicated, and how is it that we can misread the evidence of our everyday experience, and be convinced that something is true when it really isn't.\" He further elaborated on some of the erroneous beliefs his book discusses, including the \"sophomore jinx\", the idea that things such as natural disasters come in threes, and the belief that the lines we are in slow down but the lines we leave speed up. In the same interview he called confirmation bias the \"mother of all biases.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Libby is the only daughter of Karl and Susan Kennedy and the mother to a son, Ben Kirk. Libby's storylines have included being involved in a motorbike accident, the loss of her husband Drew Kirk, giving birth to Ben, getting married to Daniel Fitzgerald and subsequently separating from him. In 2008, Valentine was forced to take sick leave for one month and executive producer, Susan Bower, made the decision to temporarily recast \"McLeod's Daughters\" actress Michala Banas in the role for a month. Valentine took leave from \"Neighbours\" in 2010 due to ill health and returned to the set in January 2011. A few months later, Valentine took indefinite leave from \"Neighbours\" to focus on her health and Libby departed off-screen on 26 May 2011. In March 2014, it was confirmed that Valentine would be returning to \"Neighbours\". She made her on-screen return on 11 June 2014.\n\n[2] Susan Kennedy: Susan Kennedy (also Smith and Kinski), is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", played by Jackie Woodburne. The character and her family were created by storyliners in an attempt to bring the show back to its roots. Susan made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 3 October 1994, along with her eldest son and daughter. The storyliners made Susan a teacher at Erinsborough High to give her immediate links with other characters. Since her introduction, Susan's personality and appearance have been through several changes.\n\n[3] Jackie Woodburne: Jacqueline Anne Woodburne (born 5 February 1956) is a Northern Irish-born actress, who is notably for her career on Australian television, and who is best known for her role of Susan Kennedy in \"Neighbours\" (a role she has played for 25 years) and her previous TV soap opera roles in \"The Young Doctors\", \"Cop Shop\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Prisoner\"  As of 2019, Along with Neighbours co-star Alan Fletcher she is the third longest-serving soap opera actor in Australia, after Home and Away stars Ray Meagher and Lynne McGranger. Woodburne was born in Carrickfergus. Her father was a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. She has two older siblings: John and Stephen. At age three she emigrated with her family to Australia. The family assumed that her father would be able to join the Australian police on arrival, but, owing to various rules and regulations, he was unable to do so. Woodburne grew up in Frankston, Victoria and attended Forest Hill Primary School, Monterey Secondary College, and Karingal High School.\n\n[4] Susan Kennedy: In 1994, the \"Neighbours\" storyliners decided to introduce a new \"solid\" family called the Kennedys. The family, which consisted of five members – a mother, father, two sons and a daughter – moved into Number 28 Ramsay Street. The storyliners felt that they needed to take the show back to its roots, as it seemed that all the houses on the street were populated with misfits and distant relatives. Alan Fletcher was cast in the role of Karl Kennedy and Benjamin McNair, Kym Valentine and Jesse Spencer were cast as teenagers Malcolm, Libby and Billy respectively. Woodburne was cast in the role of Susan, the matriarch of the family. The actress revealed that she only intended to play the part of Susan for twelve months, but she fell in love with the show and stayed. Actress Ailsa Piper was also considered for the role of Susan. She would later portray Ruth Wilkinson.\n\n[5] Kennedy family (Neighbours): The Kennedy family are a fictional family from the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\". They have been a large part of the show since 1994, when the five-strong family moved into Ramsay Street. Both Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) and his wife Susan (Jackie Woodburne) celebrated 20 years on the show in 2014, and are stalwarts of the fictional Erinsborough community, with Karl serving as the area's doctor and Susan as principal of Erinsborough High. They have earned multiple award nominations for their roles. The Kennedy family has expanded to introduce several others since its conception, although plays a relatively minor role as of 2014, with Karl and Susan as the only members of their family still residing in Ramsay Street.\n\n[6] Kennedy family (Neighbours): Teaching organisation TES commented on Woodburne's portrayal of Susan in terms of her suitability as a teacher. They said that \"Susan Kennedy from \"Neighbours\" manages to be the comforting mother figure as well as coming down hard when necessary\", and praised her for showing \"the highs and lows of the job\". In June 2014, Kerry Barrett from \"All About Soap\" was pleased to see Libby return, saying \"We were just as thrilled as the Kennedys were to see lovely Lib back in Erinsborough. And when Karl asked if she had anything to go home to, we thought how brilliant it would be if she stayed.\" The returns of other characters including Holly Hoyland and Malcolm Kennedy were also praised as a worthy celebration of Susan and Karl's 20 years on \"Neighbours\".\n\n[7] Deborah Kennedy: Kennedy also delivered the famous (in Australia) catch-phrase \"\"Not happy, Jan!\"\" in the oft-quoted TV commercial for the Yellow Pages telephone directory. In the 2000s television guest roles have included appearances series \"MacLeod's Daughters\" and \"Welcher & Welcher\". Starting 2006, Kennedy appeared in a recurring role in the soap opera \"Neighbours\" as Mishka Schneiderova, Lou Carpenter's Russian partner whom he met online.

The character was introduced along with her husband and three teenage children by storyliners in an effort to bring the show back to its roots, as it seemed that all the houses on Ramsay Street were populated with misfits and distant relatives. Actress Ailsa Piper was initially considered for the role of Susan, before she was cast as Ruth Wilkinson. Woodburne received the role, and later revealed that she only intended to play the part for twelve months, but she soon fell in love with the show. Susan was given a teaching job at the local high school, giving her close links with the other characters. On her arrival, Susan was described as being good natured and more open-minded than her husband Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher).\n\n[9] Kennedy family (Neighbours): Karl and Susan's marriage was initially presented as strong, with both Woodburne and Fletcher commenting that they enjoyed them having a \"really solid foundation for a marriage\". However, they experienced marital difficulties when Karl cheated on Susan with his receptionist Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and, although they reconciled, this made Susan lose trust in Karl's commitment to their marriage. As a result, she wrongly accuses him of having an affair with Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaite), and they divorce, with Karl eventually starting a relationship with Izzy. Susan briefly remarries to Alex Kinski (Andrew Clarke) and their step-children become part of the extended Kennedy family, with both Billy and Malcolm having left the series several years earlier. Susan and Karl eventually reunite, and, despite separating again for several years, they remain together on the soap today, 20 years after their initial debut.\n\n[10] Susan Kennedy: During a feature on fictional television teachers, Susan was praised by teaching website TES Connect. Along with Will Schuester from American television show \"Glee\", TES said that there are some teachers on television who manage to portray \"convincing representations of the highs and lows of the job\". They also added \"Susan Kennedy from \"Neighbours\" manages to be the comforting mother figure as well as coming down hard when necessary\". \"The Times\" named Susan's amnesia storyline as one of their top 15 most memorable \"Neighbours\" moments. They said \"She slipped on milk, bumped her head and thought she was 16 again. Her failure to understand why she was living with a family on Ramsay Street lasted nearly a year\". Television channel Five's Holy Soap website also named the storyline as Susan's most memorable moment, calling it \"classic viewing\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Suzanne Collins is the first children's or young adult author to sell over one million Amazon Kindle ebooks, making her the sixth author to join the \"Kindle Million Club\". In March 2012, Amazon announced that Collins had become the best-selling Kindle ebook author of all time.\n\n[2] List of accolades received by The Hunger Games film series: \"The Hunger Games\" film series consists of four science-fiction adventure films based on \"The Hunger Games\" novels by the American author Suzanne Collins. The four films, entitled \"The Hunger Games\", \"\", \"\" and \"\", were released serially worldwide between March 2012 and 2015.

The trilogy's second book, \"Catching Fire\", was released in September 2009, and its third book, \"Mockingjay\", was released on August 24, 2010. Within 14 months, 1.5 million copies of the first two \"Hunger Games\" books were printed in North America alone. \"The Hunger Games\" was on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for more than 60 weeks in a row.

In a review for \"The New York Times\", John Green wrote that the novel was \"brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced\", and that \"the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine.\" However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing \"described the action and little else.\" \"Time\" magazine's review was also positive, stating that it \"is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book\" and praising what it called the \"hypnotic\" quality of the violence. In Stephen King's review for \"Entertainment Weekly\", he compared it to \"shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway.\" However, he stated that there were \"displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults\" and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. Elizabeth Bird of \"School Library Journal\" praised the novel, saying it is \"exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns\", and called it one of the best books of 2008. \"Booklist\" also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. \"Kirkus Reviews\" gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that \"poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers–a crying shame\".

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the other name of The Caesarian province of Flavius?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Flavia Caesariensis: Flavia Caesariensis (Latin for \"The Caesarian province of Flavius\"), sometimes known as Britannia Flavia, was one of the provinces of the Diocese of \"the Britains\" created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in  296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. It seems to have been named after Chlorus's family and was probably located beside Maxima Caesariensis, but their positions and capitals remain uncertain. At present, most scholars place Flavia Caesariensis in the southern Pennines, possibly reaching the Irish Sea and including the lands of the Iceni. Its capital is sometimes placed at Lindum Colonia (Lincoln).\n\n[2] Lucius Caesetius Flavus: He appears as the tribune \"Flavius\" in Shakespeare's biographical play \"Julius Caesar\". Here Shakespeare has confounded the \"cognomen Flavus\" with the gentile name \"Flavius\", which is derived from the surname. As in history, Flavius and his fellow tribune (here named \"Marullus\" or \"Murellus\") are punished for removing decorations from statues of Caesar during a parade. Their parts in the play are meant to quiet down the audience.\n\n[3] Mauretania Caesariensis: Mauretania Caesariensis (Latin for \"Caesarian Mauretania\") was a Roman province located in what is now Algeria in the Maghreb. The full name refers to its capital Caesarea Mauretaniae (Caesarea Mauritaniae) (modern Cherchell), in order to distinguish it from neighboring Mauretania Tingitana, which was ruled from Tingis (now Tangiers in Morocco).\n\n[4] Count Theodosius: Although the title \"Count\" is derived from the Roman \"Comes\", the term \"Count Theodosius\" is misleading – causing an association with the feudal system, where a Count was often an effectively independent ruler, which was not the case under the Roman Empire.  There is some evidence that Flavius Theodosius's father was called Flavius Julius Honorius, and his uncles Flavius Julius Gerontius and Flavius Julius Eucherius. He himself was called Flavius Julius Theodosius, claimed descending from the gens Julia through Gaius Julius Caesar's cousin Sextus Julius Caesar. Probably sometime in the late 330s or early 340s he married Flavia Thermantia. By her, he had at least two sons, Honorius and Theodosius, born at Cauca (modern Coca, Segovia) in Spain. The family were Orthodox Christians.In 368 Flavius Theodosius was first raised to the Roman military rank of comes (akin to a general) and sent to Britannia to recover the lands lost to the Great Barbarian Conspiracy in the previous year. Ammianus Marcellinus records that he put down a rebellion by the Pannonian Valentine. Having done so, he recovered and re-arranged its provinces, although many of its people had been killed or sold into slavery by the invaders. Known to have been with him on this expedition were his younger son Theodosius and his nephew, the future usurper Magnus Maximus.\n\n[5] Maxima Caesariensis: Maxima Caesariensis (Latin for \"The Caesarian province of Maximus\"), also known as Britannia Maxima, was one of the provinces of the Diocese of \"the Britains\" created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in  296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. Its position and capital remain uncertain, although it was probably adjacent to Flavia Caesariensis. On the basis of its governor's eventual consular rank, it is now usually considered to have consisted of Augusta or Londinium (London) and southeastern England.\n\n[6] Illyricum (Roman province): The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC led to a conflict between the leaders of the plot murder him, Marcus Junius Brutus, and Gaius Cassius Longinus, and the Caesarians led by the Second Triumvirate which took charge of Rome. This led to the Liberator's Civil War (43–42 BC). Before this civil war Brutus and Cassius fled to the east. They had been assigned the Roman provinces of Macedonia (Greece) and Syria respectively by Caesar. However, the Caesarians had the two provinces reassigned to Gaius Antonius (the brother of Mark Antony) and Publius Cornelius Dolabella respectively. They were Caesarians. Brutus and Cassius were given Creta et Cyrenaica instead. They were unhappy with being given this small province and prepared to invade Macedonia and Syria. However, the senate then voted to restore the two provinces to them. Brutus was also assigned Illyria. He arrived in Macedonia when Gaius Antonius had just arrived there to take up his propraetorship which had been assigned to him prior to the change made by the senate. His predecessor, Quintus Hortenius, joined Brutus. Vatinius marched on Dyrrachium and seized it before Brutus got there. However, the soldiers of his three legions (minus the lost cohorts), who disliked him, defected to Brutus, who then went on to engage Gaius Antonius who was in Apollonia (near Fier, Albania). He won over the troops of Antonius (his seven cohorts and a legion under his lieutenant, Lucius Piso) as well.\n\n[7] Flavia (gens): In modern use, \"Flavius\" is a personal name, and widely used in romance languages, including Italian and Spanish \"Flavio\" (fem. \"Flavia\"), French \"Flavien\" (fem. \"Flavie\"), Portuguese \"Flávio\" (fem. \"Flávia\"), and Romanian \"Flavius\" or \"Flaviu\" (fem. \"Flavia\").\n\n[8] Maxima Caesariensis: Modern scholars are uncertain whether the province was named for the western senior emperor Valerius Maximian or the eastern junior emperor Galerius Maximian. Birley has argued that Maxima and Flavia originally consisted of a single province, which received the name \"Britannia Caesariensis\" as a mark of favour for support against the rebel Allectus in 296. Although Flavia is usually thought to have been formed from the old province of Lower Britain, Birley proposes that Upper Britain was divided in two (between Prima and Caesariensis) and then three (Prima, Maxima, and Flavia). This repeats Camden's earlier theory (relying on Sextus Rufus) that Maxima was formed first and Flavia followed sometime after.\n\n[9] Flavia (gens): During the later period of the Empire, the name \"Flavius\" frequently descended from one emperor to another, beginning with Constantius, the father of Constantine the Great. The name became so ubiquitous that it was sometimes treated as a praenomen, to the extent of being regularly abbreviated \"Fl.\", and it is even described as a praenomen in some sources, although it was never truly used as a personal name. The last emperor to take the name was eastern emperor Constantine IV, during the seventh century.\n\n[10] Flavius Severianus: After his father died in 307 in Italy fighting against rival tetrarchs Maximian and Maxentius, Severus' young son Flavius Sevrianus sought refuge in the Eastern part of the empire under Galerius. When Galerius died in 311, Flavius Severianus became an obstacle for Licinius in his ambitions to rule the East and so he fled to Maximinus Daia in Asia who made him \"praeses\" (governor) of the province of Isauria. In August 313 Maximinus Daia died and Flavius Severianus lost his last protector. He fell into the hands of Licinius, who had him executed as a usurper.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was recorded at the famed Automatt studio in San Francisco. The Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra sings background vocals on \"Folsom Prison Blues\". The song \"Dead Heroes\" was included on Rodney Bingenheimer's punk compilation album, \"The Best Of Rodney On The ROQ\". Joe Ohliger III directed a music video for \"Guns Of Revolution\", as part of an interview for Videowest, an independent television studio that was based in San Francisco. It was shot at Fort Point in San Francisco, at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n[2] The Goodees: The band's song, \"Condition Red\", was their only hit, peaking at #46 on the Billboard charts. \"Condition Red\" can be found on girl-group compilations such as Rhino's \"One Kiss Can Lead to Another\" and the first volume of the \"Where the Girls Are\" CD series. Their song \"Jilted\" can be found on volume six of the \"Where the Girls Are\" series.  In December 2010, Ace Records UK issued a CD compilation, \"Condition Red! The Complete Goodees\". The album contains the entire \"Candy Coated Goodees\" LP, four non-LP singles and B-sides, and seven never-before released tracks.\n\n[3] Red Rockers: The band assembled its first full-length album, \"Condition Red\", while on tour. Travel through California led them to a new record label, 415 Records of San Francisco, which released the 12-song LP in 1981. The record included a newly redone version of \"Guns of Revolution\" as well as the live track \"Dead Heroes\", which had appeared on a local New Orleans punk compilation and quickly became a signature song for the band. \"Condition Red\" also included a guest appearance by Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra who lent background vocals to the cover version of Johnny Cash's \"Folsom Prison Blues\". Performing in support of the album, Red Rockers were added as the opening act for The Clash as they toured Louisiana and Texas in early 1982.\n\n[4] Little Red Rooster: Two different dates and recording locations are known. Wyman recalled that the song was recorded September 2, 1964, at Regent Sound in London, while the session information for the 1989 Rolling Stones box set \"\" lists \"November 1964 Chess Studios, Chicago\". Biographer Massimo Bonanno commented, \"The boys entered the Regent Sound Studios on September 2nd [1964] to resume work on ... 'Little Red Rooster' ... [and later on November 8, 1964, at Chess] some unverified sources [indicate] the boys also put the final touches to their next British single 'Little Red Rooster'\". According to Davis, Jones was left to later record overdubs after the track was recorded without him.\n\n[5] Jakub Kindl: On 14 February 2015, the Red Wings assigned Kindl to the Grand Rapids Griffins for a conditioning assignment. Kindl has not played for the Red Wings since suffering an elbow injury on 27 December 2014. On 20 February 2015, the Red Wings recalled Kindl from his conditioning assignment with the Griffins. During his condition assignment, Kindl recorded one goal, and a plus-two rating in back-to-back wins for the Griffins.\n\n[6] Back from the Grave, Volume 1 (CD): The set begins with \"My Confusion\", by The Elite from Fort Worth Texas. \"Do You Understand Me,\" was their last release by Grand Rapids, Michigan's The JuJus. Two songs by the Alarm Clocks from Parma, Ohio are included, \"Yeah\" and \"No Reason to Complain\"--both recorded at Sound Ideas Recording Studio in Cleveland. The Fabs from Fullerton, California, are sometimes mistaken for being from Texas, perhaps because the cut, \"That's the Bag I'm In,\" though recorded in Hollywood, was released on the Dallas-based Cottonball label. The Malibus from Providence, Rhode Island can be heard on the fuzz-drenched \"Cry\" and the Legends from Holland, Michigan, play \"I'll Come Again,\" which was recorded in 1965 but not released until 1967 on Fenton Records. Several of the odder cuts are the \"We All Love Peanut Butter\" and a take on \"Jack the Ripper,\" both done by the One Way Streets and \"Rat's Revenge Part One\" and \"Rat's Revenge Part Two\" by the Rats. The Swamp Rats, from Pittsburgh do a rendition of the Sonics's \"Pycho.\" Detroit's the Unrelated Segments sing \"Cry, Cry, Cry.\" The Monacles from Orange County, California perform \"I Can't Win,\" and the Lil' Boys Blue, from Sunnyvale, California, close the set with \"I'm Not There.\"\n\n[7] AWK: where \"condition\" is typically an expression and \"action\" is a series of commands. The input is split into records, where by default records are separated by newline characters so that the input is split into lines. The program tests each record against each of the conditions in turn, and executes the \"action\" for each expression that is true. Either the \"condition\" or the \"action\" may be omitted. The \"condition\" defaults to matching every record. The default \"action\" is to print the record. This is the same pattern-action structure as sed.\n\n[8] Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95: Live at Red Rocks 8.15.95 is an album by the Dave Matthews Band, released on October 28, 1997. It was recorded live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado on August 15, 1995. The album is known on the Internet by the abbreviation L@RR. The band's performance was during the third consecutive year at which they had played at the venue (although in 1993 only as a warm up for The Tragically Hip / The Samples.) Guitarist Tim Reynolds guested with the band during the entire show. Most of the songs featured were from the band's most recent album \"Under the Table and Dreaming\". \"Ants Marching,\" \"Satellite,\" \"Seek Up,\" \"Recently,\" and \"Tripping Billies\" originally appeared on the band's first album, \"Remember Two Things\", while \"Proudest Monkey,\" \"Two Step,\" \"Lie in Our Graves,\" and \"Drive In Drive Out\" would not appear as studio recordings until the release of \"Crash\" in 1996. \"#36\" was later reworked into the song \"Everyday,\" which was included on the album of the same name in 2001. Also included is the band's cover of \"All Along the Watchtower.\"\n\n[9] Wrapped in Red: Recording sessions of the basic instrumental tracks for \"Wrapped in Red\" took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: \"It was a lot of fun for us because we got to go back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything.\" He further added: \"We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off.\" Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra. In providing instrumentation for the record, Kurstin used all of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, was pleased with the aspect, saying: \"Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir.\" Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer\n\n[10] Reckoning (R.E.M. album): R.E.M. started recording \"Reckoning\" at Reflection Sound in Charlotte, North Carolina on December 8, 1983. The group recorded over two eight-day stretches around Christmas that year, separated by two weeks of canceled studio time that allowed the band to perform in Greensboro, North Carolina, go see a movie, and shoot a video in the studio. While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews, Buck sometimes stated that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that they were at the studio for over 25 days — during which he worked eighteen-hour days), while Easter said \"When I read 'eleven days' I thought, what the fuck! It was twenty days, which was still short, but it's not eleven.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Silknet provides mobile communication (branches: Geocell and S1), cable internet (branches: SilkOptic and DSL), wireless internet, IPTV (branch Silk TV), OTT Streaming TV (Silk-TV Digital), wireless fixed telephony, cable fixed telephony (VoIP, OTT), Satellite TV service (branch: Global TV). Silknet's main local competitors are MagtiCom, New Net, Beeline, and Maxnet. In 2018, Silknet was acquired by Geocel. This was the largest acquisition of a company in Georgia.\n\n[2] Telecommunications in Georgia (country): There are three cellular telephone networks: MagtiCom LTD, Silknet JSC, and Mobitel Georgia (Russian Beeline group). The cellular network market counts more than 3,000,000 active customers in total.\n\n[3] Media of Georgia: There are three cellular telephone networks: MagtiCom LTD, Silknet JSC, and Mobitel Georgia (Russian Beeline group). The cellular network market counts more than 3,000,000 registered customers in total (the commercially active number is not known). Coverage extends to over 98% of the populated territory as of 2010;\n\n[4] Economy of Chuvashia: As in most regions of Russia, phone lines remain the most common form of telecommunication. The republic’s telephone company, ChuvashSvazinform (JSC), provides all major telecom services to its customers, and it is a simple matter to make direct calls to most places in and outside of Russia. International connections are quick and clear. Svazinform is working with the Siemens Company to upgrade its telecommunication system and replace old analog lines with digital ones. This project has already made substantial progress, and the quality of the digital network in Cheboksary and Novocheboksarsk meets international standards for high-speed video and data transmission. Companies can install and lease as many phone lines as needed. There is also a satellite-based telecom provider, ComBelgia (JSC), that provides direct intercity and international long-distance connections over their own private network.\n\n[5] SSL (company): SSL's customers include AsiaSat, Azercosmos, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.

Of KSAT's 120 employees, 22 are stationed in Longyearbyen and work at SvalSat. KSAT is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and some of the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than 30 minutes after downloading.\n\n[7] Special Communications Organization: SCO is responsible for providing the telecommunication needs to a population of 4.5 Million spread over 85,793 km consisting of the mountainous terrains of Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. SCO stands the largest telecom network services provider equally focusing on urban and rural areas development providing telecom services to both public and private sector. It has a unique distinction of providing all brands of telecom services from voice to data under one platform. SCO has the largest fixed-line network in Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. SCO is also the largest backbone service provider in Azad Jammu & Kashmir and GIlgit Baltistan having more than 1600 kilometers of optical fiber in the region. In addition to the wired fixed line services, SCO is also providing CDMA services (SCO CDMA). It is also providing cellular mobile service under the brand name of SCOM. SCOM is the first ever GSM service of Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan. DSL and Dialup Internet services are provided under the brand name of SNET.\n\n[8] South London Route Utilisation Strategy: At the time of the awarding of the Integrated Kent franchise, Southeastern undertook to provide services according to two phases of service level commitments (SLC): SLC1, the immediate level of services; SLC2, the mix of services to be provided once high-speed domestic services began over HS1, scheduled for December 2009. In the latter service mix, a net reduction of services over the 'classic' (i.e. non-HS1) routes was envisaged. However the SLRUS concluded that, owing mainly to the growth in traffic, the overall level of services over the classic routes be broadly retained. By the time of RUS publication, this had been agreed by DfT and Southeastern as regards the Hayes, Sidcup, Bexleyheath, Greenwich and Chislehurst slow lines. The timetable will still need to be revamped to accommodate the HS1 services from Medway and east Kent.\n\n[9] JSAT (satellite constellation): On April, 2014, SSL announced that it had been awarded a contract by JSAT to manufacture two satellites: JCSAT-15, a 10-kW satellite to replace N-SAT-110 plus expansion capability, and JCSAT-16, an 8.5-kW satellite with K band and K band payload to be used as a backup to the existing fleet. On September 8, Arianespace announced that it had signed a launch service contract for the launch of JCSAT-15 aboard an Ariane 5 ECA rocket. And on September 10, 2014, JSAT announced that it had signed a second launch service contract with SpaceX for the launch of JCSAT-16 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket.\n\n[10] Ruselectronics: Sirius was established in 2009.

It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame house, with asymmetrical massing characteristic of the Queen Anne style. It has a front gable with decorative cut shingles and an oriel window, and a porch with turned posts and balustrade. It is a locally distinctive example of a middle class Queen Anne style Victorian in a rural setting. It was built between 1885 and 1888 for Richard Ward, a milk dealer who had married into the locally prominent Abbot family. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.\n\n[2] John Ward House (Salem, Massachusetts): The Ward House was built in three distinct phases. John Ward, a currier by profession, built the first portion of the house in 1684. This consisted of a two-story structure with one room on each floor, and a large chimney at one end. This portion was extended by Ward to the right-side of the chimney, giving the house a typical colonial five-bay facade, with center entry and chimney. The last addition to the house was the lean-to at the rear, which gave the house a saltbox appearance, and was apparently added not long before Ward's death in 1734. By this time he was apparently sharing the house with his son Benjamin, who inherited the property. The house remained in the hands of the Ward family until 1816, when it was sold at auction as part of an estate.\n\n[3] Richard Wherrett: Richard Wherrett died of liver failure on 7 December 2001, three days before his 61st birthday, after 15 years warding off the effects of HIV.

Ward was born in 1852 in New York City where his parents owned a small bakery. The family moved to Pittsburgh, PA in 1856 and continued to work in the bakery business. At the age of 21 he joined forces with his brother George to open a bakery of their own. The Ward Bread Company expanded to include factories across the middle and northeastern United States. After amassing a substantial fortune, Ward moved his family to New Rochelle in 1912 and built a large residence and associated buildings on quaker ridge road. The main house, which no longer stands, was known as ‘Homewood’ and was located on the south side of the road across from what is today the Hudson Montessori School. The main building of the current school was the original stables and garage of the Ward estate. Robert Ward died suddenly in 1915 leaving his $15,000,000 estate to his wife and their nine children.\n\n[5] Bleak House: Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards, Richard Carstone and Ada Clare (who are both his and one another's distant cousins). They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce\"; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will, and the two wills conflict. Richard and Ada soon fall in love, but though Mr Jarndyce does not oppose the match, he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession. Richard first tries a career in medicine, and Esther meets Allan Woodcourt, a physician, at the house of Richard's tutor. When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution of \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce\", John Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls \"the family curse\".\n\n[6] Bellwood (Richmond, Virginia): Bellwood, also known as Auburn Chase, New Oxford, Sheffield, and Defense Supply Center Richmond Officers' Club-Building 42, is an historic plantation house located near Richmond in Chesterfield County, Virginia. Bellwood was built on land formerly owned by the Seth Ward family. Judge Richard Ward, son of the original Seth Ward immigrant, established Sheffield in 1665 and five subsequent generations of first born sons named Seth were raised at Sheffield. Seth Ward V sold the property to his aunt and uncle, Mary Ann Ward and Richard Claiborne Gregory in 1797. Richard Claiborne Gregory's son, Richard Augustus Gregory 1795-1835 built Bellwood about 1804, and it is a two-story, five bay, timberframe I-house dwelling with a low hipped roof in the Georgian style. The house is set on brick foundations and sheathed in weatherboard. The property also contains the Gregory Family cemetery, the historic elk pasture created by James Bellwood, and two feeding stations for the elk. In 1887, the house and farmlands were acquired by James Bellwood, who restored the depleted land and made the farm one of Virginia's chief agricultural showplaces. In 1941, the Bellwood property was acquired by the U.S. Government and used for the Department of Defense General Supply Center. The house is maintained as the center's officers' club.\n\n[7] Elm Grove, Brighton: Demographic data is collated at ward level. The Hanover & Elm Grove ward covers also covers the Hanover suburb and part of the Carlton Hill/Albion Hill district, which have different characteristics, housing styles and population densities. For the ward overall in 2001, the population was about 13,000, the gross housing density was 68 dwellings per hectare (27.5 dwellings per acre), 50% of dwellings were terraced houses, and housing tenure was split 53%–47% between ownership and rental.\n\n[8] Sallie Ward: Her paternal grandfather, William Ward, married Sally Johnson, a sister of Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson.

Her maternal grandfather, Major Matthew Flournoy, served in the American Revolutionary War.\n\n[9] George Oakley Totten Jr.: In 1923, he rescued architect H. H. Richardson's Warder Mansion (1885–88), at 1515 K Street NW, from demolition. He disassembled the stonework and some of the interiors, transported them about 1.5 miles from downtown to Meridan Hill, and re-erected the building alongside his house for use as apartments. The Warder Mansion is the only surviving building by Richardson in Washington, D.C. He was active in professional architecture related associations. From 1897 to 1939, he served as secretary and vice president of the American section of the permanent committee of the International Congress of Architects. During World War I, he served as a major with the Army Corps of Engineers. In 1926, he authored \"Maya Architecture\".\n\n[10] Richard Warde: Richard was the son of Thomas Warde, the Porter, Controller of the Works and Keeper of the Armoury at Windsor Castle, by his wife, Maud, the daughter of Thomas Moore of Bourton in Buckinghamshire. In 1571, during the reign of Elizabeth I of England, he was elected the Member of Parliament for Berkshire, due to the support of Henry Norris, 1st Baron Norreys. He was also MP for Windsor a number of times, as well as being Cofferer of the Royal Household and Clerk of the Green Cloth. Like his father, he was Keeper of Cranbourne Lodge. He married Colubria, the daughter of William Flambert of Chertsey in Surrey, by whom he had seventeen children. They lived together at Hurst House in Berkshire.

Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz. Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, to take command for the upcoming Midway operation. Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the Coral Sea engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway. Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\". To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\n[2] Midway (2019 film): Depicts the Battle of Midway.On May 23, 2017, it was reported that Roland Emmerich would be directing the World War II film \"Midway.\" In April 2018, Woody Harrelson and Mandy Moore joined the ensemble cast for the film. In July 2018, Luke Evans was cast in the film to play Commander Wade McClusky, who is awarded the Navy Cross for his role in the battle of Midway. Robby Baumgartner was hired in the crew for the duties of a cinematographer.\n\n[3] Battle of Midway: Admiral Nimitz had one critical advantage: US cryptanalysts had partially broken the Japanese Navy's JN-25b code. Since early 1942, the US had been decoding messages stating that there would soon be an operation at objective \"AF\". It was initially not known where \"AF\" was, but Commander Joseph Rochefort and his team at Station HYPO were able to confirm that it was Midway: Captain Wilfred Holmes devised a ruse of telling the base at Midway (by secure undersea cable) to broadcast an uncoded radio message stating that Midway's water purification system had broken down. Within 24 hours, the code breakers picked up a Japanese message that \"AF was short on water\". No Japanese radio operators who intercepted the message seemed concerned that the Americans were broadcasting uncoded that a major naval installation close to the Japanese threat ring was having a water shortage, which could have tipped off Japanese intelligence officers that it was a deliberate attempt at deception.\n\n[4] Battle of Midway: Three U.S. airmen, Ensign Wesley Osmus, a pilot from \"Yorktown\"; Ensign Frank O'Flaherty, a pilot from \"Enterprise\"; and Aviation Machinist's Mate Bruno F. (or P.) Gaido, the radioman-gunner of O'Flaherty's SBD, were captured by the Japanese during the battle. Osmus was held on \"Arashi\"; O'Flaherty and Gaido on the cruiser \"Nagara\" (or destroyer \"Makigumo\", sources vary); all three were interrogated, and then killed by being tied to water-filled kerosene cans and thrown overboard to drown. The report filed by Nagumo tersely states of Ensign Osmus, \"He died on 6 June and was buried at sea\"; O'Flaherty and Gaido's fates were not mentioned in Nagumo's report. The execution of Ensign Wesley Osmus in this manner was apparently ordered by \"Arashi\"'s captain, Watanabe Yasumasa (if Watanabe had survived the war, rather than having died when the destroyer \"Numakaze\" sank in December 1943, he would have likely been tried as a war criminal).\n\n[5] Battle of Midway: Over the following two days, several strikes were launched against the stragglers, first from Midway, then from Spruance's carriers. \"Mikuma\" was eventually sunk by Dauntlesses, while \"Mogami\" survived further severe damage to return home for repairs. The destroyers and were also bombed and strafed during the last of these attacks. Captain Richard E. Fleming, a U.S. Marine Corps aviator, was killed while executing a glide bomb run on \"Mikuma\" and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\n[6] Battle of Midway: The Battle of Midway was a decisive naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that took place between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea. The United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz, Frank Jack Fletcher, and Raymond A. Spruance defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto, Chūichi Nagumo, and Nobutake Kondō near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. Military historian John Keegan called it \"the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare\".\n\n[7] Battle of Midway: By the time the battle ended, 3,057 Japanese had died. Casualties aboard the four carriers were: \"Akagi\": 267; \"Kaga\": 811; \"Hiryū\": 392; \"Soryū\": 711 (including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board); a total of 2,181. The heavy cruisers \"Mikuma\" (sunk; 700 casualties) and \"Mogami\" (badly damaged; 92) accounted for another 792 deaths.\n\n[8] Battle of the Coral Sea: One of the most significant effects of the Coral Sea battle was the loss of and to Yamamoto for his planned battle in the air with the U.S. carriers at Midway (\"Shōhō\" was to have been employed at Midway in a tactical role supporting the Japanese invasion ground forces). The Japanese believed that they sank two carriers in the Coral Sea, but this still left at least two more U.S. Navy carriers, \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\", which could help defend Midway. The aircraft complement of the U.S. carriers was larger than that of their Japanese counterparts, which, when combined with the land-based aircraft at Midway, meant that the Combined Fleet no longer enjoyed a significant numerical aircraft superiority over the U.S. Navy for the impending battle. In fact, the U.S. would have three carriers to oppose Yamamoto at Midway, because, despite the damage the ship suffered during the Coral Sea battle, \"Yorktown\" was able to return to Hawaii. Although estimates were that the damage would take two weeks to repair, \"Yorktown\" put to sea only 48 hours after entering drydock at Pearl Harbor, which meant that she was available for the next confrontation with the Japanese. At Midway, \"Yorktown\"s aircraft played crucial roles in sinking two Japanese fleet carriers. \"Yorktown\" also absorbed both Japanese aerial counterattacks at Midway which otherwise would have been directed at \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\". In contrast to the strenuous efforts by the U.S. to employ the maximum forces available for Midway, the Japanese apparently did not even consider trying to include \"Zuikaku\" in the operation. No effort appears to have been made to combine the surviving \"Shōkaku\" aircrews with \"Zuikaku\"s air groups or to quickly provide \"Zuikaku\" with replacement aircraft so she could\n\n[9] C. Wade McClusky: Rear Admiral Clarence Wade McClusky, Jr., (1 June 1902 – 27 June 1976) was a United States Navy aviator during World War II and the early Cold War period. He is credited with playing a major part in the Battle of Midway. In the words of Admiral Chester Nimitz, McClusky's decision to continue the search for the enemy and his judgment as to where the enemy might be found, \"decided the fate of our carrier task force and our forces at Midway\".\n\n[10] Wilfred Holmes: In 1941 Captain Holmes was recalled to duty and assigned to Station HYPO, which was breaking Japanese codes, especially their naval cipher JN-25. By May 1942 US Naval Intelligence knew that the Japanese were planning an attack at a spot they called AF, but did not know what AF signified. Navy cryptanalyst Joseph Rochefort thought AF was Midway Island. Holmes had the idea of faking a water supply failure on Midway. He suggested using an unencrypted emergency warning, in the hope of provoking a Japanese response, thus establishing whether AF was Midway. Holmes' ruse worked and led to the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway. Holmes was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The team is a member of the Southern League and is the class Double-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins. Two teams named the Suns have played in Jacksonville since 1962: a class Triple-A International League team from 1962–1968, and the current Double-A team from 1970 to 2016. From 1985–1990 the team was known as the Jacksonville Expos, when they were affiliated with the Montreal Expos MLB team. The team rebranded itself as the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp on November 2, 2016 and began the 2017 season under the new name.\n\n[2] Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp: In November 2016 the Jacksonville Suns were renamed the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp. All Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp games are televised live on MiLB.TV. The play-by-play broadcaster is Roger Hoover.\n\n[3] Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp: The first team known as the Jacksonville Suns began play in the Triple-A International League in 1962. The team had been founded in Havana, Cuba, where they were known as the Havana Sugar Kings. Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959 the team relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey, but soon folded; the franchise was bought by the Cleveland Indians, who moved it to Jacksonville as the Jacksonville Suns in 1962. The president was local baseball fixture Sam W. Wolfson, previously the owner of the Jacksonville Braves; the Suns replaced the Jacksonville Jets Sally League club. During this period a number of later Major League stars played for the Suns, including Tommy John, Nolan Ryan, and Tom Seaver, and the team won the International League championship in 1968. Following that season the team's parent club, the New York Mets, decided to relocate the team to Virginia, where they became the Norfolk Tides. Jacksonville was without baseball in 1969, but in 1970 a new Suns team began play in the Double-A Southern League. The team was affiliated with both the Montreal Expos and the Milwaukee Brewers in its inaugural season, with the Cleveland Indians in 1971, and then with the Kansas City Royals from 1972–1984. Affiliation switched back to the Expos from 1985–1990, during which period the team was known as the Jacksonville Expos. Since then it has been affiliated with the Seattle Mariners (1991–1994), the Detroit Tigers (1995–2000), the Los Angeles Dodgers (2001–2008), and most recently the Miami Marlins (2009–present). The Suns have appeared in the Southern League playoffs 15 times, and won the championship in 1996, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2014. After winning the championship in \n\n[4] Sports in Jacksonville: Minor League Baseball has been played in Jacksonville nearly every year since the early 20th century. The city's current team are the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, who play in the Class Double-A Southern League. Two teams named the Suns have played in Jacksonville since 1962: A class Triple-A International League team from 1962–1968, and the current Double-A team (renamed to the Jumbo Shrimp in 2017) from 1970 to the present They play at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville.\n\n[5] Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp: Jacksonville has had minor league baseball nearly every year since the early 20th century. From 1904 to 1961 the city was home to minor league teams such as the Jacksonville Jays, the Jacksonville Tars, and the Jacksonville Braves, as well as the Jacksonville Red Caps of the Negro Leagues. The former three teams all played in the South Atlantic League (the \"Sally League\"), which became the modern Southern League in 1964.\n\n[6] Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp: The modern Jacksonville club has played in the Southern League longer than any other. The Suns won the International League title in 1968 and the Southern League championship in 1996, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010 and 2014. They play at the Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, an 11,000-person capacity, $34 million park that opened in 2003. Since moving to the facility the Suns were a top selling franchise in the Southern League.\n\n[7] Jacksonville, Florida: Jacksonville is also home to several minor league-level teams. The Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp, a class Double-A baseball team, have played in Jacksonville continuously since 1970, longer than any other Double-A team has been in its city, and are the top-selling franchise in the Southern League. The Jacksonville Sharks, who began play in 2010, were the champions of the Arena Football League's ArenaBowl XXIV in 2011 and now play in the National Arena League. The Jacksonville Axemen are a semi-professional rugby league team founded in 2006, and now play in the USA Rugby League. The Jacksonville Giants basketball team started play in the new American Basketball Association in December 2010. The Giants won the 2012 ABA Championship in March 2012 in Tampa, Florida. The Jacksonville Armada FC is a soccer team that began play in the North American Soccer League (NASL) in 2015.\n\n[8] Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp: The Suns played at Wolfson Park from 1962 until it was demolished in 2002. Since 2003 they have played at Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, an 11,000 seat, $34 million field created as part of the Better Jacksonville Plan. Since moving to the Baseball Grounds the Suns have consistently led the Southern League in attendance, drawing over one million fans in their first four years. The Suns' success has led to speculation that the team may move to class Triple A in the future.\n\n[9] Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp: In 2016, \"Forbes\" listed the Jumbo Shrimp as the 28th-most valuable Minor League Baseball team with a value of $27.5 million.\n\n[10] Randy Ready: Ready was named as the manager for the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp in the Miami Marlins organization for the 2018 season.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

His documentary works include \"Galapagos 3D\" about life on the Galápagos Islands, \"The Wildest Dream\" about Mount Everest, and \"Flying Monsters 3D\" about the pterosaurs. In addition to documentaries, he has also provided the music to the English adaptations of anime such as \"Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie\", cartoons such as \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" as well as live-action films such as \"The Tall Man\" and the BBC series \"First Life with Sir David Attenborough\". In 2010, he received a nomination for Best Original Score for a Documentary Feature at the International Film Music Critics Association (IFMCA) for his work on \"The Wildest Dream\".\n\n[2] Andrew Yang (artist): In 2008 Yang created his first doll, and with it launched his first brand, The Kouklitas. Following this collection, he was commissioned by stylist James Worthington Demolet to create several looks from Spring 2010 RTW collections for The Block Magazine. Photographed by Dan Forbes, the editorial went viral. This led to a commission celebrating Joyce Boutique Hong Kong's 40th anniversary with windows in the flagship Hong Kong and Shanghai stores, as well as the publication together with Susan Locht of his first book \"The Kouklitas\".\n\n[3] Jiri Georg Dokoupil: In accordance with the thesis of Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, Dokoupil never wanted to be subordinated to a personal or a forced style. He never developed a uniform style that would allow the observer to recognize his work. Rather he paraphrases different preceding styles, plays with them and invents new techniques. Only a certain expressivity and his affinity for eroticism may define his world of images. His oeuvre today contains over 60 series and far more than 100 devised techniques or styles. A selection of his series is listed below. Since 1989 Dokoupil has developed the technique of \"Soot Paintings\", painting projected images with soot of a burning candle or in larger works with the flame of a torch onto a blank canvas hanging flat from the ceiling. The \"Soot Paintings\", often regarded as the most important series within Dokoupils oeuvre, contain different series such as the depictions of art auctions, the \"Subastas\"- series, of 1989 or recent ones called \"Leopards\"(2000–2009) or \"Christ\" paintings depicting Jesus Christ (a reference to his 1986/87 series of the Jesus paintings). For his \"Tire paintings\" of 1991–1992, he used freshly colour-dyed rolling tires on predominantly wet, ungrounded canvas. In his \"Soap Bubble Paintings\" of 1992-93 he lets soap-bubbles burst on canvas, while the liquid soap is mixed with colour or ink. In 2003 Dokoupil creates \"Whip Paintings\" by lashing a cowboy whip, which was stuck in a paint pot before, at the canvas. One of Dokoupil‘s most recent work is the series of spray-painted \"Buddhas\" on canvas. They are meant to be like Buddha, Marilyn and Mona Lisa all at once,\n\n[4] Joël Mpah Dooh: In terms of public art, he is the author of one of the four works outside of the series \"Art’venture\", offered by doual’art to the city of Douala in 1992. During this workshop with computer-aided graphic design, he met the “dean” of Cameroonian artists Koko Komégné, whom he befriended and cofounded the collective \"Kheops Club\" in 1994. Joel Mpah Dooh was also one of the artists invited to Scénographies Urbaines de Douala in 2002. He has participated in several collective and individual exhibitions, which brought him to Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, the United States, Cuba, Lebanon and France. In 2007, he was invited by the Fondation Blachère à Apt (France) to inaugurate the residency series Art et entreprise.\n\n[5] Jan Snoeck: Initially Jan Snoeck worked with the materials stone, wood and bronze. Later he mainly worked in ceramics. He uses cheerful, primary colors and usually people are subject. Among other things, he made a sculpture \"The beds\" for Westeinde Hospital in The Hague (see image). The most monumental work of Snoeck is found both in the Netherlands and abroad.\n\n[6] Alec Duffy: Duffy has written and directed several shows with his theater company, Hoi Polloi, including \"Shadows\", \"All Hands\" and \"The less we talk\". In 2011, he founded JACK, a performing arts space in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. He performs there regularly with his avant-garde theatre improv band, The Georges. In 2011, Duffy won an Obie Award for his work on \"Three Pianos\".\n\n[7] Otto Joachim (composer): Since the 1960s he has concentrated on his compositions which are a mix of aleatoric and electroacoustic works. He composed a multi-channel electroacoustic work for the Canadian Pavilion, Katimavik at Expo 67 in Montreal. It was in the late-1970s that Joachim took up painting and sculpture. In 1994, he received an honorary doctorate from Concordia University, Montreal. The multi-channel electroacoustic studio in the Department of Music at Concordia University is named \"The Otto Joachim Project Studio\", where one of his paintings hangs.\n\n[8] Isaak van den Blocke: His principal work is the decoration of the ceiling (completed 1608) of the Great Chamber of the former main town hall in Danzig. This work was composed of 25 oil paintings on oak panels, with a central composition, an allegory to the glorious trade of Danzig (Apotheosis of Danzig). He also made paintings for the winter council room of the town hall (1611-1614).\n\n[9] Haim Moussa Douek: In September 1956, Rabbi Douek was appointed as deputy to Chief Rabbi Haim Nahoum, who recommended that Rabbi Haim Douek succeed him as Chief Rabbi of Egypt. When Rabbi Haim Nahoum's died in November 1960, Rabbi Haim Douek assumed responsibility for leading the Jewish community as the nation's last Chief Rabbi.\n\n[10] Haim Moussa Douek: Rabbi Haim Moussa Douek (1905–1974) (Hebrew: חיים דוויך / Arabic:حايم دويك) was the last Chief Rabbi of Egypt . Born in Anteb, Turkey, on the border of Syria, he was the eldest child of Moussa Haim Douek and Zarifa Harari. In November 1952, Rabbi Douek was appointed by the chief rabbi of Egypt, Rabbi Haim Nahoum to join the rabbinical body of Cairo's chief rabbinate.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Originally, Urban Dictionary was intended as a dictionary of slang, or cultural words or phrases, not typically found in standard dictionaries, but it is now used to define any word or phrase. Words or phrases on Urban Dictionary may have multiple definitions, usage examples, and tags. Some examples include, but are not limited to \"Angry Hitler\" or \"Russian Candy Cane.\" As of 2014, the dictionary had over seven million definitions, while 2,000 new entries were being added daily.\n\n[2] Urban Dictionary: As of 2013, Urban Dictionary has been used in several court cases to define slang terms that are not found in dictionaries. For example, the slang term \"jack\" was used in order to define the name the defendant on trial used for their team, \"the jack boys.\" Urban Dictionary was also used in a District Court complaint where a man posted a threat on a gun exchange Facebook page. The crowd-sourced dictionary was also used in a sexual harassment court case in Tennessee to define the phrase \"to nut\" as \"to ejaculate\".\n\n[3] Urban Dictionary: Originally, Urban Dictionary was intended as a dictionary of slang, or cultural words or phrases, not typically found in standard dictionaries, but it is now used to define any word or phrase. Words or phrases on Urban Dictionary may have multiple definitions, usage examples, and tags. Some examples include, but are not limited to \"Angry Hitler\" or \"Russian Candy Cane.\"\n\n[4] Urban Dictionary: The site was founded in 1999 by Aaron Peckham while he was a freshman computer science major at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. He launched the site to compare urban slang used by university students in different parts of California. He had previously created a spoof version of the Ask Jeeves web search engine while studying at Cal Poly but closed the website after he received an infringement letter. He created Urban Dictionary initially as a parody of actual dictionaries, which he thought tended to be \"stuffy\" and \"take themselves too seriously\".\n\n[5] Urban Dictionary: Although the explicit nature of many definitions on the site has led to objections, the site contains many non-explicit definitions. For example, the word \"massive\" is Jamaican in origin and is used to describe a group or collective. Peckham responded to the issue, stating that people may not be able to understand the meaning of such words without the aid of Urban Dictionary.\n\n[6] Urban Dictionary: For the first five years, the site generated revenue without making a profit, but did not appear to incur any costs. In 2003, the website gained wider attention after a news article revealed that United Kingdom (UK) high court judges had used Urban Dictionary to assist them in a case involving two rappers (the judges unsuccessfully attempted to comprehend slang language that the rappers used).\n\n[7] Urban Dictionary: In the context of Urban Dictionary, \"definitions\" include not only literal definitions, but also descriptions. As such, \"to define\" a word or phrase on Urban Dictionary does not necessarily entail providing a strict definition; merely a description of some aspect of the word or phrase could suffice for inclusion in the dictionary.\n\n[8] Urban Dictionary: In the United States, some state Departments of Motor Vehicles refer to Urban Dictionary in determining if certain license plates are appropriate or not. For example, a man in Las Vegas was allowed to keep \"HOE\" as his license plate after managing to convince the state, with the use of Urban Dictionary, that it meant \"TAHOE\", as in the vehicle made by Chevrolet, since that was already taken.\n\n[9] Urban Dictionary: Over a 30-day period in March and April 2011, 67,000 people wrote 76,000 new definitions for Urban Dictionary, while 3,500 volunteer editors were registered. In an April 2011 \"Guardian\" article titled \"In praise of urban dictionaries\", Peckham revealed an overview of 10 rules that he had devised for the site's content: \"Publish celebrity names, but reject 'real life' names. Reject nonsense, inside jokes or anything submitted in capital letters. Racial and sexual slurs are allowed, racist and sexist entries are not.\"\n\n[10] Urban Dictionary: By 2009, the site listed around 4 million entries and received about 2,000 new submissions per day. In April 2009, the site registered 15 million unique visitors, while 80 percent of its monthly users were younger than 25. In July 2009, Peckham explained to the \"New York Times\" that Urban Dictionary is the \"anti-Wikipedia\", because it doesn't attempt neutrality: \"Every single word on here [Urban Dictionary] is written by someone with a point of view, with a personal experience of the word in the entry.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

As the producers did not collaborate with Bono or the Edge, the film score did not incorporate any of the theme song's melodies, as was the case in previous James Bond films. Swedish group Ace of Base had also written a proposed theme song, but label Arista Records pulled the band out of the project fearing the negative impact in case the film flopped. The song was then rewritten as their single \"The Juvenile\".\n\n[2] GoldenEye (song): \"GoldenEye\" is a song performed by Tina Turner, and the eponymous theme song for the 1995 James Bond film, \"GoldenEye\". Released as a single in November 1995, the song was a big chart hit in Europe, topping the Hungarian Singles Chart and reaching the top five in Austria, Finland, France, and Switzerland, as well as number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. It was less successful outside the continent, reaching number 43 in Canada, number 63 in Australia, and number two on the US \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100.\n\n[3] Production of the James Bond films: The soundtrack to \"GoldenEye\" was composed and performed by Éric Serra. Prolific Bond composer John Barry turned down an offer by Barbara Broccoli to score the film. The theme song, \"GoldenEye\", was written by Bono and The Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner. As Serra did not collaborate with Bono or The Edge, orchestral versions of the song did not appear throughout \"GoldenEye\", as had been the case in previous James Bond films.\n\n[4] Wildest Dreams (Tina Turner album): The album includes the song \"GoldenEye\", the theme to the James Bond film of the same name. It was written by Bono and The Edge of the Irish band U2 and was recorded and released as a single in 1995. The song \"Confidential\" was written and co-produced for Turner by the British group Pet Shop Boys. The band's singer and lyricist, Neil Tennant, sings backing vocals on the track. The original Pet Shop Boys demo (with Tennant on vocals) can be found on the 2001 2-disc re-release of their album \"Very\". \"Unfinished Sympathy\" is a cover of the Massive Attack song. The track \"All Kinds of People\" was co-written by Sheryl Crow. \"In Your Wildest Dreams\" was later re-recorded as a duet with Barry White and released as a single, reaching #32 in the UK Singles Chart. The duet version is included on the U.S. version of the album, which has a different track listing, released some six months after it was first issued in Europe and most other parts of the world, and features an alternate cover. The album also features guest vocals from Sting on the track \"On Silent Wings\" which peaked at #13 in the UK. \"Wildest Dreams\" includes a total of six European single releases; \"GoldenEye\", \"Whatever You Want\"—co-written by Taylor Dayne, \"On Silent Wings\", Turner's cover version of John Waite's \"Missing You\", \"Something Beautiful Remains\" and the title track \"In Your Wildest Dreams\".\n\n[5] GoldenEye (song): Like many Bond themes before it, Tina Turner's version was not the only recorded song for the film. Swedish pop band, Ace of Base also recorded a song that was optioned to the studio. Ace of Base's \"The GoldenEye\" was later reworked into \"The Juvenile\" which appeared on their \"Da Capo\" album in 2002.\n\n[6] Tomorrow Never Dies (song): After the financial and critical reception of Tina Turner's \"GoldenEye\" which bolstered and revamped her career, the theme to its sequel was an unusual hot commodity. Producers took the opportunity to offer the job to several different artists, allowing them to submit their best effort. Sheryl Crow's was ultimately chosen, but just as other Bond themes before it, it was not the only song recorded for the film. Top contender, alternative rock band Pulp wrote a song for the film, which was later retitled \"Tomorrow Never Lies\" and released as a B-side to their \"This Is Hardcore\" album in 1998. Britpop band Saint Etienne recorded their own version of a song titled \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", which was later released as an exclusive to their fanclub on their \"Built On Sand\" album in 1999. Canadian country and pop singer, k.d. lang's optioned theme, \"Surrender\" which was co-written by the film's composer David Arnold, ended up being used as an end-title song.\n\n[7] Dionne Warwick: On October 20, 2009, Starlight Children's Foundation and New Gold Music Ltd. released a song that Warwick had recorded about ten years prior called \"Starlight\". The lyrics were written by Dean Pitchford, prolific writer of \"Fame\", screenwriter of — and sole or joint lyricist of every song in the soundtrack of — the original 1984 film \"Footloose\", and lyricist of the \"Solid Gold\" theme. The music had been composed by Bill Goldstein, whose versatile career included the original music for NBC's \"Fame\" TV series. Warwick, Pitchford and Goldstein announced that they would be donating 100% of their royalties to Starlight Children's Foundation, to support Starlight's mission to help seriously ill children and their families cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, education and family activities.When Bill and Dean brought this song to me, I instantly felt connected to its message of shining a little light into the lives of people who need it most\", said Warwick. \"I admire the work of Starlight Children's Foundation and know that if the song brings hope to even just one sick child, we have succeeded.\n\n[8] GoldenEye (soundtrack): GoldenEye: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack from the United Artists film is the soundtrack to the 17th James Bond film of the same name and was composed by Éric Serra. It was released by EMI on November 14, 1995. Serra composed and performed a number of synthesizer tracks, including the radically reworked version of the \"James Bond Theme\" that plays during the gun barrel sequence, while John Altman and David Arch provided the more traditional symphonic music. The producers hired composer John Altman to write a more traditional, orchestral score piece for the tank-chase scene in St. Petersburg. Serra's original, unused track for that sequence can still be found on the soundtrack album as \"A Pleasant Drive in St. Petersburg\".\n\n[9] GoldenEye (song): The song was written by Bono and The Edge of U2. Bono and The Edge wrote the song for Turner when they learned that she had been invited to sing the theme to the upcoming \"Bond\" movie. The track was produced and mixed by British producer/remixer/composer Nellee Hooper, best known for his work with Massive Attack, Madonna, U2 and Björk. The track reached #10 on the UK Singles Chart and became a Top 5 hit in most other European countries.\n\n[10] The Shirelles: Tiara Records, along with the Shirelles' contract, was sold to Decca Records in 1959 for $4,000; Greenberg stayed as the manager, securing performances for the group, including one at the Howard Theatre in Washington D.C. After two singles did poorly, including their first release—with Coley as lead vocalist—of \"Dedicated to the One I Love\", a cover of the \"5\" Royales song of the same name, Decca returned them to Greenberg and gave up on them, considering them a one-hit act. On Greenberg's new label, Scepter Records, they rereleased \"Dedicated to the One I Love\" as a single, which peaked at #89; Wayne Wadhams, David Nathan, and Susan Lindsay in \"Inside the Hits\" attribute the low rating to poor distribution. In order to better promote the group, Greenberg asked songwriter Luther Dixon, who had previously worked with Perry Como, Nat King Cole, and Pat Boone and co-written the 1959 hit \"16 Candles\", to write for and produce songs for them. Dixon accepted.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The character, Amber, was so named because of her hair color, and this is the only major film in which Darnell—normally known for her raven hair and somewhat Latin looks—appears as a redhead. It was the most expensive film yet produced by Fox, and publicity at the time compared the novel to \"Gone with the Wind\". Darnell replaced British actress Peggy Cummins in July 1946 at a cost of $350,000. Because $1 million had already been spent on production costs when Darnell was brought in, the pressure was high to make the film a financial success. Her casting was a result of a campaign for stronger roles. Regardless, she was surprised to find out that she had been cast, because she had been intensively rehearsing for \"Captain from Castile\" at the time. Although she had to give up that role and work with Otto Preminger, she was delighted to play the title role and thought she was \"the luckiest girl in Hollywood.\"\n\n[2] Linda Darnell: In early 1942, Darnell filmed \"The Loves of Edgar Allan Poe\", another film that would not do much to improve her career. Meanwhile, she realized that Darryl F. Zanuck had lost interest in her, and she was overlooked for most film roles that suited her. Instead, she was cast in roles that she loathed, including the musical \"Orchestra Wives\" (1942). Zanuck insisted that she take the role, but she was replaced by Ann Rutherford after 12 days of shooting. The press reported that \"Linda Darnell and Twentieth Century-Fox aren't on the best of terms at the moment.\" As a punishment, she was loaned out to another studio for a supporting role in a B movie called \"City Without Men\". According to co-star Rosemary DeCamp, Darnell nevertheless was \"very polite\", and she was satisfied to work at a studio which did not treat her as a child. In April 1943, she was put on suspension, which meant being replaced in the Technicolor musical film \"The Gang's All Here\" (1943). By this time, Darnell had eloped, which caused Zanuck to be even more furious. In 1943, she was cast, uncredited, as the Virgin Mary in \"The Song of Bernadette\". By late 1943, Darnell was fed up with critics only praising her beauty rather than her acting abilities. Judging her performance in \"Sweet and Low-Down\" (1944), in which she co-starred with Lynn Bari, one critic of the \"Los Angeles Examiner\" wrote, \"Lynn comes off the best because she has more of a chance to shine. Linda just doesn't have enough to do—but looks beautiful doing it.\" Darnell was reduced to second leads and was overlooked\n\n[3] Linda Darnell: Darnell had been widely expected to win an Academy Award nomination for \"A Letter to Three Wives\"; when this did not happen, her career began to wane. She was cast opposite Richard Widmark and Veronica Lake in \"Slattery's Hurricane\" (1949), which she perceived as a step down from the level she had reached with \"A Letter to Three Wives\", though it did well at the box office.\n\n[4] Linda Darnell: Linda Darnell (born Monetta Eloyse Darnell, October 16, 1923April 10, 1965) was an American film actress. Darnell progressed from modeling as a child to acting in theater and film. At the encouragement of her mother, she made her first film in 1939, and appeared in supporting roles in big-budget films for 20th Century Fox throughout the 1940s. She rose to fame with co-starring roles opposite Tyrone Power in adventure films, and established a main character career after her role in \"Forever Amber\" (1947). She won critical acclaim for her work in \"Unfaithfully Yours\" (1948) and \"A Letter to Three Wives\" (1949).\n\n[5] Linda Darnell: Since the beginning of her career at 20th Century Fox, Darnell had been very positive about her frequent co-star Tyrone Power. In a 1939 interview, she expressed her interest in starring opposite Power in \"Johnny Apollo\" (1940). Rationalizing why she was not cast, Darnell said: \"It's a man's part and the girl's role is only incidental.\" Dorothy Lamour was cast, instead. Nevertheless, Darnell had her way as she was assigned to the female lead opposite Power in the light romantic comedy \"Day-Time Wife\" (1939). Although the film received only slightly favorable reviews, Darnell's performance was received positively, with one critic saying: \"Despite her apparent youth, [Darnell] turns in an outstanding performance when playing with popular players.\" Another critic wrote that \"little Linda is not only a breath-taking eyeful, but a splendid actress, as well.\" \"Life\" magazine stated that Darnell appeared to be 22 and was \"the most physically perfect girl in Hollywood\". Following the film's release, she was cast in the drama comedy \"Star Dust\" in December 1939. The film was hailed as one of the \"most original entertainment idea in years\" and boosted Darnell's popularity, being nicknamed 'Hollywood's loveliest and most exciting star'. \"Variety\" continued: \"Miss Darnell displays a wealth of youthful charm and personality that confirms studio efforts to build her to a draw personality.\" Her studio contract had been revised to allow Darnell to earn $200 a week.\n\n[6] Linda Darnell: The following year, Darnell portrayed Daphne de Carter in the Preston Sturges' comedy \"Unfaithfully Yours\" (1948), also starring Rex Harrison, and was then rushed into production as one of the three wives in the comedy/drama \"A Letter to Three Wives\" (1949). Darnell's hard-edged performance in the latter won her unanimous acclaim and the best reviews of her career. Darnell became one of the most-demanded actresses in Hollywood, and she now had the freedom to select her own roles. She longed for the leading role in the controversial film \"Pinky\" (1949), but Zanuck feared that her character would be compared to Amber by the audience, and \"A Letter to Three Wives\" co-star Jeanne Crain was cast instead.\n\n[7] Linda Darnell: Released in 1944, the film provided her a new screen image as a pin-up girl. Shortly after, Darnell was again loaned out to portray a showgirl in \"The Great John L.\", the first film to feature her bare legs. Darnell complained that the studio lacked recognition of her, which prodded Zanuck to cast her in \"Hangover Square\" (1945), playing a role she personally had chosen. The film became a great success, and with Darnell's triumph assured, she was allowed to abandon her upcoming film \"Don Juan Quilligan\" (1945), which would have been another low point in her career. In January 1945, she was added to the cast of the film noir \"Fallen Angel\" (1945), which also included Dana Andrews and Alice Faye. Despite suffering from the \"terrifying\" director Otto Preminger, Darnell completed the film and was praised by reviewers so widely that there was even talk of an Oscar nomination. Due to her success in \"Fallen Angel\", she was cast opposite Tyrone Power in \"Captain from Castile\" in December 1945, on the insistence of Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Although she looked forward to the film project, believing it would be her most important to date, she was later replaced by newcomer Jean Peters due to scheduling conflicts, a decision she resented.\n\n[8] Linda Darnell: Although only 15 at the time, Darnell posed as a 17-year-old and was listed as 19 years old by the studio. According to columnist Louella O. Parsons, Darnell was \"so young, so immature and so naive in her ideas\" and was very loyal to her boss, Darryl F. Zanuck. Her true age came out later in 1939, and she became one of the few actresses under the age of 16 to serve as leading ladies in films. While working on \"Hotel for Women\", Darnell was cast alongside Henry Fonda and Claudette Colbert in \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" (1939) in June 1939. She was later replaced, because the studio felt her role was not important enough. In an interview during production of \"Hotel for Women\", which lasted until June, Darnell admitted that movie making was not what she expected: \"I'm learning what really hard work is. At home in Dallas I used to sprawl on the lawn and dream about the nice, easy time the screen stars must be having in Hollywood, but the last two months have taught me quite another story.\"\n\n[9] Linda Darnell: In the summer of 1940, Darnell began working on \"The Mark of Zorro\" (1940), in which she again co-starred as Power's sweetheart in a role for which Anne Baxter was previously considered. A big-budget adventure film that was raved over by the critics, \"The Mark of Zorro\" was a box office sensation and did much to enhance Darnell's star status. Afterwards, she was paired with Henry Fonda for the first time in the western \"Chad Hanna\" (1940), her first Technicolor film. The film received only little attention, unlike Darnell's next film \"Blood and Sand\" (1941), which was shot on location in Mexico and in which she was reteamed with Power. It was the first film for which she was widely critically acclaimed. Nevertheless, Darnell later claimed that her downfall began after \"Blood and Sand\". In an interview she said:\n\n[10] Linda Darnell: Aside from her co-starring role opposite Richard Widmark, Stephen McNally and Sidney Poitier in the groundbreaking \"No Way Out\" (1950), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, which she later called \"the only good picture [she] ever made,\" her later films were rarely noteworthy, and her appearances were increasingly sporadic. Further hampering Darnell's career was the actress's alcoholism and weight gain. Her next film was a Western, \"Two Flags West\" (1950). Due to her allergy to horses, she loathed making Westerns, and in addition to her complaints about her \"colorless\" role, she disliked her co-stars Joseph Cotten and Cornel Wilde. She was even less enthusiastic about her next film, \"The 13th Letter\" (1951), which reunited her with Preminger, and she only took the role because it was an unglamorous one. Shortly after its release, she was put on suspension for refusing a role in the film \"The Guy Who Came Back\" (1951) opposite Paul Douglas and Joan Bennett, because it felt \"too similar.\" She later consented to take on the glamor role, but she refused to bleach her hair for it.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich process converts sugar to acids, alcohol or gases?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Syngas fermentation: The main products of syngas fermentation include ethanol, butanol, acetic acid, butyric acid, and methane. Certain industrial processes, such as petroleum refining, steel milling, and methods for producing carbon black, coke, ammonia, and methanol, discharge enormous amounts of waste gases containing mainly CO and into the atmosphere either directly or through combustion. Biocatalysts can be exploited to convert these waste gases to chemicals and fuels as, for example, ethanol.\n\n[2] Fermentation: \"Homolactic fermentation\" (producing only lactic acid) is the simplest type of fermentation. The pyruvate from glycolysis undergoes a simple redox reaction, forming lactic acid. It is unique because it is one of the only respiration processes to not produce a gas as a byproduct. Overall, one molecule of glucose (or any six-carbon sugar) is converted to two molecules of lactic acid: It occurs in the muscles of animals when they need energy faster than the blood can supply oxygen. It also occurs in some kinds of bacteria (such as lactobacilli) and some fungi. It is the type of bacteria that converts lactose into lactic acid in yogurt, giving it its sour taste. These lactic acid bacteria can carry out either homolactic fermentation, where the end-product is mostly lactic acid, or \"Heterolactic fermentation\", where some lactate is further metabolized and results in ethanol and carbon dioxide (via the phosphoketolase pathway), acetate, or other metabolic products, e.g.: If lactose is fermented (as in yogurts and cheeses), it is first converted into glucose and galactose (both six-carbon sugars with the same atomic formula): Heterolactic fermentation is in a sense intermediate between lactic acid fermentation and other types, e.g. alcoholic fermentation (see below). The reasons to go further and convert lactic acid into anything else are:\n\n[3] Fermentation in food processing: Food fermentation is the conversion of sugars and other carbohydrates into alcohol or preservative organic acids and carbon dioxide. All three products have found human uses. The production of alcohol is made use of when fruit juices are converted to wine, when grains are made into beer, and when foods rich in starch, such as potatoes, are fermented and then distilled to make spirits such as gin and vodka. The production of carbon dioxide is used to leaven bread. The production of organic acids is exploited to preserve and flavor vegetables and dairy products.\n\n[4] Tooth decay: Bacteria in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, and most commonly sucrose (table sugar) into acids such as lactic acid through a glycolytic process called fermentation. If left in contact with the tooth, these acids may cause demineralization, which is the dissolution of its mineral content. The process is dynamic, however, as remineralization can also occur if the acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash. Fluoride toothpaste or dental varnish may aid remineralization. If demineralization continues over time, enough mineral content may be lost so that the soft organic material left behind disintegrates, forming a cavity or hole. The impact such sugars have on the progress of dental caries is called cariogenicity. Sucrose, although a bound glucose and fructose unit, is in fact more cariogenic than a mixture of equal parts of glucose and fructose. This is due to the bacteria utilising the energy in the saccharide bond between the glucose and fructose subunits. \"S.mutans\" adheres to the biofilm on the tooth by converting sucrose into an extremely adhesive substance called dextran polysaccharide by the enzyme dextransucranase.\n\n[5] Ethanol fermentation: Ethanol fermentation, also called alcoholic fermentation, is a biological process which converts sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose into cellular energy, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as by-products. Because yeasts perform this conversion in the absence of oxygen, alcoholic fermentation is considered an anaerobic process. It also takes place in some species of fish (including goldfish and carp) where (along with lactic acid fermentation) it provides energy when oxygen is scarce.\n\n[6] Biogas upgrader: In the Selexol process (now licensed by UOP LLC), the Selexol solvent dissolves (absorbs) the acid gases from the feed gas at relatively high pressure, usually 300 to 2000 psia (2.07 to 13.8 MPa). The rich solvent containing the acid gases is then let down in pressure and/or steam stripped to release and recover the acid gases. The Selexol process can operate selectively to recover hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide as separate streams, so that the hydrogen sulfide can be sent to either a Claus unit for conversion to elemental sulfur or to a WSA Process unit for conversion to sulfuric acid while, at the same time, the carbon dioxide can be sequestered or used for enhanced oil recovery.\n\n[7] Guangxi Guitang Group: The Guitang Group constructed an eco-industrial park (EIP) with two main value chains: a paper chain, and an alcohol chain. Each of these chains deals with different by-products to make final products in each stage of production. The alcohol chain includes a sugar refinery, an alcohol plant, and a fertilizer plant. Each by-product of production at each stage of the chain provides an input of raw material to the next stage. A description of how each chain operates is described by a case study on the Guitang Group. \"The sugarcane enters the sugar mill and is processed along one of two product chains: the sugar chain (containing the originally conceived sugar refinery and the alcohol plant) or the paper chain (containing the pulp and paper mills). Each downstream (internal) company uses the by-products from upstream companies as secondary material inputs. In addition, careful attention is given to reducing the residual waste and to its ultimate disposal. The sugar chain results in the ultimate production of sugar, alcohol, cement, and compound fertilizer (i.e., fertilizer with a specific ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In the sugar refinery, the sugarcane “juice” that is released in the crushing and grinding assembly in the sugar mill is refined in a carbonation process that yields a higher quality refined sugar than does the sulfitation process that is used by the majority of cane sugar plants in China (Wei 2004). Wei notes that sulfitation is favored by the GG’s competitors, in part, because the filter mud (one of the wastes from the refining process) from sulfitation can easily be disposed of as a direct application fertilizer. Filter mud from the carbonation process, on the other hand, can have a significant negative effect on the local soil if it is applied directly to the land. The GG has addressed this problem by using the carbonation\n\n[8] Selexol: In the Selexol process (now licensed by UOP LLC), the Selexol solvent dissolves (absorbs) the acid gases from the feed gas at relatively high pressure, usually 300 to 2000 psia (2.07 to 13.8 MPa). The rich solvent containing the acid gases is then let down in pressure and/or steam stripped to release and recover the acid gases. The Selexol process can operate selectively to recover hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide as separate streams, so that the hydrogen sulfide can be sent to either a Claus unit for conversion to elemental sulfur or to a WSA Process unit for conversion to sulfuric acid while, at the same time, the carbon dioxide can be sequestered or used for enhanced oil recovery. The Selexol process is similar to the Rectisol process, which uses refrigerated methanol as the solvent. The Selexol solvent is a mixture of the dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol.\n\n[9] Hydrogenation: Hydrogenation is a useful means for converting unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives. Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles, which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines. Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the oxo process from carbon monoxide and an alkene, can be converted to alcohols. E.g. 1-propanol is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. Xylitol, a polyol, is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar xylose, an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by hydrogenation of nitriles, while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the polyurethane monomer isophorone diisocyanate, is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.\n\n[10] Metabolism: Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings, while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts, including the stomach and pancreas, and salivary glands. The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins. Carbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is the band's biggest hit, peaking at number 16 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 11 in Australia, and number one in Canada after its re-release in 1996, having drawn an audience among adult contemporary fans. It was featured as the theme of the TV series \"Party of Five\", and was featured on the show's accompanying soundtrack. It also appeared in the opening credits of the 1995 film \"Heavyweights\". It was also the second song played in the movie \"Milk Money\".\n\n[2] BoDeans: The first song from the album, \"Closer to Free\", brought Bodeans to a much larger audience after it was selected as the theme song to the TV series \"Party of Five\" in 1994. (In 1999, the band would perform a cover of The Beatles' \"I've Just Seen a Face\" as the theme song for the show's short-lived spinoff, \"Time of Your Life\".) Due to the new-found exposure, \"Closer to Free\" became the group's biggest pop hit, peaking at #16 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100, three years after its release. \"Closer to Free\" was also the opening song used in the movie \"Heavyweights\", and is the theme song (and namesake) for an annual fundraiser at Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven, in New Haven, Connecticut.

The radio single was released in promotion of the band's 2008-released EP, \"Closer\". Although the track also appears on the band's 2009 album \"The Long Fall Back to Earth\", the single was released far in advance of its announcement and release to be considered that album's first single. The version of the song that appears on \"The Long Fall Back to Earth\" is a different mix than the one that appears on the \"Closer EP\", containing a longer intro and song length. \"Closer\" was co-produced by Ron Aniello, who also helped co-produce the band's 2003 release \"Who We Are Instead\" and helped co-write a handful of tracks from their \"Good Monsters\" studio album.\n\n[4] Michael Paynter: \"This Welcome Diversion\" was initially set to be released in 2008, but despite a set release date, was delayed until 2011.

Paynter began touring, serving as a supporting act for Vanessa Amorosi, Newton Faulkner, Seal and The Veronicas on their Revenge Is Sweeter tour. In between tours, Sony (his label), had paid for songwriting trips to London and Los Angeles.

The album's promotion hit a snag after its record label, Beyond Records, went out of business in 2002 shortly after \"Closer\"'s release. Beyond Record's bankruptcy left \"Closer\" out of print for several years. In June 2009, Better Than Ezra announced that it had acquired the rights to \"Closer\" and would re-release it in the Fall of 2009 with two new previously unreleased tracks, \"Simple Song\" and \"Screwed Up and Beautiful.\"\n\n[7] Closer (Michael Paynter song): \"Closer\" is the debut single from Australian singer-songwriter, Michael Paynter.

This poppy is notable as an agricultural weed (hence the common names including \"corn\" and \"field\") and after World War I as a symbol of dead soldiers.\n\n[2] Papaver umbonatum: Papaver umbonatum (Hebrew: ,) also known as the Semitic poppy, is a flowering plant, a species of \"Papaver\" native to Israel and the entire biblical land. It is often confused and misidentified as \"Papaver rhoeas\" (corn poppy, common in Europe) even though it is classified as the rest of the subspecies, since they are very similar in form and appearance.\n\n[3] Papaver rhoeas: \"Papaver rhoeas\" is a variable, erect annual, forming a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed. In the northern hemisphere it generally flowers in late spring (between May and October in the UK) but if the weather is warm enough other flowers frequently appear at the beginning of autumn. It grows up to about 70 cm in height. The stems hold single flowers, which are large and showy, 50 to 100 mm across, with four petals that are vivid red, most commonly with a black spot at their base. The petals slightly overlap each other. The plant can produce up to 400 flowers in a warm season, despite their lasting only one day. The flower stem is usually covered with coarse hairs that are held at right angles to the surface, helping to distinguish it from \"Papaver dubium\" in which the hairs are more usually appressed (\"i.e.\" held close to the stem). The capsules are hairless, obovoid (egg-shaped), less than twice as tall as they are wide, with a stigma at least as wide as the capsule. Like many other species of \"Papaver\", the plant exudes white to yellowish latex when the tissues are broken.\n\n[4] Papaver dubium: \"Papaver dubium\" is a variable annual, growing to about 60 cm in height. It generally flowers in late spring to mid-summer. The flower is large (30-70mm) and showy, with four petals that are lighter red than in the similar \"Papaver rhoeas\", and most commonly without a black spot at the base. The flower stem is usually covered with coarse hairs that are closely appressed to the surface, helping to distinguish it from \"P. rhoeas\" in which the hairs are more usually patent, held at right angles to the stem. The capsules are hairless, elongated to more than twice as tall as they are wide, tapering slightly at the tip, with a stigma generally less wide than the capsule. The plant exudes white to yellowish latex when the tissues are broken. The species can form a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed.\n\n[5] Papaver bracteatum: Papaver bracteatum, also known as the Iranian poppy and Persian poppy and the great scarlet poppy (it is firstly described by Dr. N. Saharghi and l. Lalezari nature 213, 1244, 1967 doi:10.1038/2131244a0 ) is a sturdy hardy perennial poppy with large deep red flowers up to 8 inches (20 cm) diameter on stiff stalks up to 4 feet (1.22 metres) high with a prominent black spot near the base of the petals. It is closely related to the commonly cultivated oriental poppy, \"Papaver orientale\" and is sometimes recorded as the varietal form Papaver orientale var. bracteatum.\n\n[6] Papaver rhoeas: In Persian literature, red poppies, especially red corn poppy flowers, are considered the flower of love. They are often called the eternal lover flower. In classic and modern Persian poems, the poppy is a symbol of people who died for love (Persian: راه عشق).\n\n[7] Papaver: The core sections of \"Papaver\" s.s. form a well-supported clade, consisting of \"Pseudopilosa\", \"Pilosa\", \"Papaver\", \"Carinatae\", \"Meconidium\", \"Oxytona\", and \"Rhoeadium\". \"Pseudopilosa\" spp. have a subscapose growth habit, and their distribution includes south-western Asia, northern Africa and southern Spain. There are some leaves on the lower part of the flower axis carrying a single flower. Carolan et al.’s (2006) analysis placed \"Pseudopilosa\" as sister to the remaining \"Papaver\" s.s. sections. \"Pilosa\" is a single species, \"P. pilosum\", found mostly in western Turkey Sects. \"Pilosa\" and \"Pseudopilosa\" are separated based on morphological and chemical differences. The monophyly of \"Carinatae\", \"Papaver\" and \"Rhoeadium\" is questionable based on current molecular evidence. \"Papaver\" sect. \"Rhoeadium\" comprises seventeen annual species. Carolan et al. (2006) use three representative species, \"P. commutatum\", \"P. dubium\", and \"P. rhoeas\" for their genetic analysis. The geographic center of \"Rhoeadium\"’s diversity is in south-western Asia and the Aegean area. They have porocidal capsules and usually dark filaments. This section is morphologically diverse however, leading Kadereit (1989) to recognize three distinct groups. The first comprises species with tetraploid and hexaploid genomes, with long capsules. The second group contains diploid species and diverse morphologies. The third group consists of diploid species and uniform morph\n\n[8] Papaver glaucum: Growing to a height of , this poppy withstands all climates, including the droughts of non-Arab Middle East. The flowers are of rich red colours, with black spots in the centre. The thin petals may be crispy. The flowers bloom to a diameter of . The inner petals stick up, which resembles a tulip. Looks similar to the corn rose poppy \"Papaver rhoeas\" and the Greek red poppy \"Papaver dubium\". The distinct characteristics is the black centre which emphasises the tulip-shaped petals surrounding it.\n\n[9] Papaver somniferum: Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy or breadseed poppy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae. It is the species of plant from which opium and poppy seeds are derived and is a valuable ornamental plant, grown in gardens. Its native range is probably the eastern Mediterranean, but is now obscured by ancient introductions and cultivation.\n\n[10] Papaver croceum: \"Papaver croceum\" can reach a height of . It is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant, with a basal rosette of long-stalked bluish-green lobed leaves. The stems are leafless and haired. Flowers are actinomorphic, solitary, wide, with four yellow, orange, reddish or white petals. They bloom from June to August. This plant is cultivated as an ornamental plant and erroneously sold under the name of \"Papaver nudicaule\", that is instead a different species (\"Papaver nudicaule\" L. – common names Iceland poppy, Icelandic poppy).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Finally, William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published \"Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus\" in 1628, which \"demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs.\" This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.\n\n[2] Medicine in the medieval Islamic world: The movement of blood through the human body was thought to be known due to the work of the Greek physicians. However, there was the question of how the blood flowed from the right ventricle of the heart to the left ventricle, before the blood is pumped to the rest of the body. According to Galen in the 2nd century, blood reached the left ventricle through invisible passages in the septum. By some means, Ibn al-Nafis, a 13th-century Syrian physician, found the previous statement on blood flow from the right ventricle to the left to be false. Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the ventricular septum was impenetrable, lacking any type of invisible passages, showing Galen's assumptions to be false. Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the blood in the right ventricle of the heart is instead carried to the left by way of the lungs. This discovery was one of the first descriptions of the pulmonary circulation, although his writings on the subject were only rediscovered in the 20th century, and it was William Harvey's later independent discovery which brought it to general attention.\n\n[3] Circulatory system: Finally, William Harvey, a pupil of Hieronymus Fabricius (who had earlier described the valves of the veins without recognizing their function), performed a sequence of experiments, and published \"Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus\" in 1628, which \"demonstrated that there had to be a direct connection between the venous and arterial systems throughout the body, and not just the lungs. Most importantly, he argued that the beat of the heart produced a continuous circulation of blood through minute connections at the extremities of the body. This is a conceptual leap that was quite different from Ibn al-Nafis' refinement of the anatomy and bloodflow in the heart and lungs.\" This work, with its essentially correct exposition, slowly convinced the medical world. However, Harvey was not able to identify the capillary system connecting arteries and veins; these were later discovered by Marcello Malpighi in 1661.\n\n[4] Hempstead, Essex: The village has one church, St. Andrew's, where William Harvey, who discovered the circulation of blood in the human body, and Sir Eliab Harvey, Captain of the Temeraire at the battle of Trafalgar, are interred.\n\n[5] Pulmonary circulation: The next developments in the human understanding of pulmonary circulation did not come until centuries later. Persian polymath Avicenna (c. 980 - 1037 CE) wrote a medical encyclopedia entitled \"The Canon of Medicine\". In this book, he translated and compiled contemporary medical knowledge and added some new information of his own. However, Avicenna's description of pulmonary circulation reflected the incorrect views of Galen. The arab physician, Ibn al-Nafis, wrote the \"Commentary on Anatomy in\" \"Avicenna's\" \"Canon\" in 1242 in which he provided the first known accurate description of pulmonary circulation as it is known today. Ibn al-Nafis made two key improvements on Galen's ideas of pulmonary circulation. First, he disproved the existence of the pores in the interventricular septum that Galen had believed to allow blood flow between the left and right ventricles. Second, he followed that the only way for blood to get from the right to the left ventricle in the absence of interventricular pores was pulmonary circulation. He also described the anatomy of the lungs in clear, correct detail, which his predecessors had not. However, like Aristotle and Galen, al-Nafis still believed that the vital spirit was formed in the left ventricle from a mixture of blood and air. Despite the enormity of Ibn al-Nafis's improvements on the theories of pulmonary circulation that preceded him, his commentary on \"The Canon\" was not widely known to Western scholars until the manuscript was discovered in Berlin, Germany, in 1924. As a result, Ibn al-Nafis was not widely credited with the discovery of pulmonary circulation in Western medical literature until recently.\n\n[6] Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus: This work is a substantial contribution to cardiac physiology, for it introduces into biology the doctrine of circulation of the blood in the seventeenth century. Opposed and obliging work heralding Harvey's discovery go back to the thirteenth century, when the pulmonary circulation and gas exchange was proposed by Ibn Al-Nafis. Both long since proven theories are incomplete when studied separately but together form core knowledge of present-day cardiology. In 1553, Michael Servetus said that blood flows from the heart to the lungs, and that it there mixes with air to form the arterial blood which flows back to the heart. Between 1570 and 1590, Cesalpino suggested, in a controversy with Galenists, that the movement of blood was more like a circulation than an oscillation; but this view lacks clarity. In 1603, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Acquapendente published a work clearly describing the valves in the veins and showing that they hinder the flow of blood away from the heart. From 1597 to 1602, Harvey studied arts and medicine at Padua, and made a careful study of the heart and the movement of blood. By 1616, he was presenting in lectures his case for the circulation of the blood, but it was not until 1628 that he published it in his classic work, \"De Motu Cordis et Sanguinis\". This book is important both for the discovery of the complete circulation and for the experimental, quantitive and mechanistic methodology which Harvey introduced. He looked upon the heart, not as a mystical seat of the spirit and faculties, but as a pump analyzable along mechanical lines. He also measured the amount of blood which it sent out to the body. He observed that with each beat two ounces of blood leave the heart;\n\n[7] Heart: Humans have known about the heart since ancient times, although its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards the heart, ancient Greeks are considered to have been the primary seat of scientific understanding of the heart in the ancient world. Aristotle considered the heart to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered the heart as the source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through the heart to the lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted the heart as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from the heart, becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered the heart valves.\n\n[8] Pulmonary circulation: The Greek physician Galen (129 - c. 210 CE) provided the next insights into pulmonary circulation. Though many of his theories, like those of his predecessors, were incorrect, his theory of pulmonary circulation dominated the medical community for hundreds of years after his death. Galen contradicted Erasistratus before him by proposing that arteries carried both air and blood, rather than air alone. He proposed that the liver was the point of origin for all blood vessels and that the heart was not a pumping muscle, but rather an organ which blood passed through. Galen's theory included a new description of pulmonary circulation. In it, air was inhaled into the lungs where it became the pneuma. Pulmonary veins transmitted this pneuma to the left ventricle of the heart to cool the blood simultaneously arriving there. This mixture of pneuma, blood, and cooling produced the vital spirits which could then be transported throughout the body via arteries. Galen also proposed that the heat of the blood arriving in the heart produced noxious vapors which were expelled through the same pulmonary veins that first brought the pneuma. He wrote that the right ventricle played a different role than the left; it transported blood to the lungs where the impurities were vented out so that clean blood could be distributed throughout the body. Though Galen's description of the anatomy of the heart was more complete than those of his predecessors, it included several mistakes. Most notably, Galen believed that blood flowed between the two ventricles of the heart through small, invisible pores in the interventricular septum.\n\n[9] Circulating free DNA: Circulated cell-free DNA was first discovered by Mandel and Metais in 1948. It was later discovered that the level of cfDNA is significantly increased in the plasma of diseased patients. This discovery was first made in Lupus patients and later it was determined that the levels of cfDNA are elevated in over half of cancer patients. This increase in cfDNA in cancer patients has been shown to be due to circulating tumor cells (CTC) traveling in the peripheral blood. The ability to extract circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from the human plasma has led to huge advancements in noninvasive cancer detection. Most notably, it has led to what is now known as Liquid Biopsy. In short, liquid biopsy is using biomarkers and cancer cells in the blood as a means of diagnosing cancer type and stage. This type of biopsy is noninvasive and allows for the routine clinical screening that is important in determining cancer relapse after initial treatment.\n\n[10] John Jacob Abel: Together with L.G. Rowntree and B.B. Turner, Abel devised what they called a \"vividiffusion\" apparatus, consisting of a series of tubes surrounded by fluid. They first demonstrated the apparatus at the Physiological Congress in Groningen in 1914. By allowing arterial blood to enter at one end of the connection, and later return to circulation through the venous connection after dialysis, they were able to demonstrate the existence of free amino acids in blood. By isolating these amino acids from blood circulation, Abel conducted various subsequent researches on the structure of proteins in the blood. Not only did Abel use the apparatus for his research work, he also realized the great clinical potential such dialysis machine would have on managing the damaging effects of renal failure. The vividiffusion apparatus Abel devised is the precursor to the modern day dialysis machine. He summarized his work in a paper published in 1913, \"On the Removal of Diffusable Substances from the Circulating Blood by Means of Dialysis\" by Transfusion Science.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It spans the Little Sioux River for . The bridge was originally located at Main Street, south of downtown Spencer over the same river. Two previous bridges had been located at the original location beginning in 1875, with a replacement in 1889. Clay County contracted with Clinton Bridge and Iron Works from Clinton, Iowa in 1900 to build this Pennsylvania through truss span. Completed the following year, it is the rare example of this type of bridge built in Iowa. A concrete arch span replaced this bridge in 1915, and it was moved to its current location the same year. The concrete abutments were built by Thor Construction Company from Cedar Falls, Iowa. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\n[2] Little Sioux River: The Little Sioux River is a river in the United States. It rises in southwestern Minnesota near the Iowa border, and continues to flow southwest for across northwest Iowa into the Missouri River at Little Sioux. The Little Sioux River was known as Eaneah-waudepon or \"Stone River\" to the Sioux Indians. Its tributaries include the Ocheyedan River, Maple River and the West Fork of the Little Sioux River. The Little Sioux River is integral to the Nepper Watershed Project, a major Iowa flood control and soil conservation program that was introduced in 1947.\n\n[3] West Fork of the Little Sioux River: West Fork of the Little Sioux River is a river in the United States. Approximately long, it courses through northwest Iowa, rising north of Marcus in Cherokee County and flowing generally southwest through farmland in Plymouth and Woodbury counties until the meandered (old) streambed finally meets the Little Sioux River near Turin in Monona County. However, the lower portion of the river, where the stream leaves the Loess Hills and enters the Missouri River floodplain near Holly Springs, Iowa, has been extensively channelized. Across this floodplain, most of the flow is actually carried by the Garretson and West Fork drainage ditches, which join to become the Monona-Harrison Ditch, which in turn enters the Missouri just upstream from the mouth of the Little Sioux in Harrison County. Thus, today the waters of the West Fork of the Little Sioux are no longer functionally tributary to the Little Sioux River proper.\n\n[4] Okoboji Bridge: The Okoboji Bridge is located southwest of Milford, Iowa, United States. The span carried traffic on 180th Avenue over a branch of the Little Sioux River. The Dickinson County Board of Supervisors hired a local contractor to build a bridge across the straits between East and West Okoboji Lakes in 1859. The wooden structures had to be rebuilt in 1874-1875. There was a desire for a drawbridge at this point to allow for steamboats to navigate between the lakes. Three different swing spans were built at this location in the 19th century. When the third span deteriorated the board of supervisors contracted with the Clinton Bridge and Iron Works of Clinton, Iowa to build a permanent span here in June 1909. The Pratt/Warren pony truss structure was completed later that year for $1,550. The bridge and the road were incorporated into the U.S. Highway System, and it was placed under the aegis of the Iowa State Highway Commission. In 1929 it was replaced with a fixed-span concrete girder structure. At that time the 1909 truss span was moved to Okoboji Township to span a branch of the Little Sioux River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The span has subsequently been abandoned.\n\n[5] Little Sioux River: Geologically, the Little Sioux rises in a region of glacial potholes near the \"Iowa Great Lakes\" (Spirit Lake, and East and West Okoboji). It then traverses a rich agricultural region on its way to the Loess Hills, from which it then flows out onto the floodplain of the Missouri River. Through much of its middle course (i.e., from Linn Grove to Smithland) the Little Sioux is a relatively wild meandered stream, with excellent canoeing, camping, and fishing opportunities. However, from Smithland downstream to its mouth, the river has been channelized and environmentally degraded.\n\n[6] Little Missouri River Bridge: The Little Missouri River Bridge, also known as the Nachitoch Bluff Bridge, is a historic bridge between rural southern Clark County, Arkansas and Nevada County, Arkansas. Now closed to traffic, it once carried County Road 179 (apparently now numbered CR 479) over the Little Missouri River. Believed to be built in 1910, it is the only known Camelback Pratt truss bridge in the state. Its main span measures , with a secondary Pratt truss span measuring in length, and there are I-beam-supported approaches on either side, giving the bridge a total length of . The bridge is located on the historic route of the Natchitoches Trace, an early colonial French-Spanish trail through the area.\n\n[7] Gates Farm Covered Bridge: The bridge was built by George W. Holmes in 1897, and is one of only nine surviving Burr trusses in the state. It was originally known as the \"Little Covered Bridge\", and was located several hundred feet downstream carrying VT 15, near the longer Cambridge Covered Bridge across the Lamoille River. It was moved to its present location in 1950. The Seymour River originally emptied into the Lamoille River further upstream of where it does currently. In 1950, the Seymour River's course was changed so that it no longer crossed the highway and instead emptied \"downstream\" of the Cambridge Bridge, making the Little Bridge unneeded. In diverting the river, the Gates family farm became separated from its fields by the new course of the river. The Little Bridge was moved to the Gates farm property over the new course of the Seymour River to restore access to the farm's fields. At that time it then became known as the Gates Farm Covered Bridge. (Incidentally, the Cambridge Covered Bridge was moved and became the Shelburne Museum Covered Bridge).\n\n[8] Big Sioux River: The Big Sioux River rises in Roberts County, South Dakota on a low plateau known as the Coteau des Prairies and flows generally southwardly through Grant, Codington, Hamlin, Brookings, Moody, and Minnehaha counties, past the communities of Watertown, Castlewood, Bruce, Flandreau, Egan, Trent, Dell Rapids, and Baltic to Sioux Falls, where it passes over a waterfall in Falls Park, which gives that city its name. Downstream of Sioux Falls and the community of Brandon, the Big Sioux is used to define the boundary between South Dakota and Iowa, flowing along the eastern borders of Lincoln and Union counties in South Dakota, and the western borders of Lyon, Sioux and Plymouth counties in Iowa, past the communities of Canton, Fairview, Hudson, Hawarden, North Sioux City, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota and Beloit, Hawarden and Akron in Iowa. It joins the Missouri River from the north at Sioux City, Iowa.\n\n[9] Big Sioux River: The Big Sioux River is a tributary of the Missouri River, 419 miles (674 km) long, in eastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa in the United States. The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on \"Big Sioux River\" as the stream's name in 1931. The river was named after the Lakota people (Sioux Indians).\n\n[10] Little Buffalo River Bridge: The Little Buffalo River Bridge is a historic bridge in central Newton County, Arkansas. The bridge carries Arkansas Highway 327 across the Little Buffalo River between Parthenon and Jasper. It is a seven-span concrete tee beam structure, with a total length of and a longest single span of . It has a curb width of , and an overall width of , including the concrete balustrades on each side. It was built in 1939.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

I really don't get it.\" He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that \"In the end, people see what they want to see. If you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what.\" Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that \"In my book \"Eternal Zero\", I opposed suicide attacks with determination\", \"I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light\", and the theme of the book was \"not to allow our memories of war to fade away\". The author also added in a tweet, \"I feel sorry for \"Eternal Zero\". [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...]. It is drawing fire literally from all directions.\"\n\n[2] The Eternal Zero: The film begins with an unspecified attack near the end of the Pacific War, a Zero fighter plane threatens the United States Pacific Fleet by cutting through its defensive anti-aircraft fire. Kyuzo Miyabe, the pilot of the Zero fighter is regarded by his comrades as a coward, though an exceptionally skilled fighter pilot, for consistently returning alive from missions, openly explaining \"I don't want to die,\" the result of a promise made to his wife Matsuno and daughter Kiyoko: to return from the war alive.\n\n[3] The Eternal Zero: \"The Eternal Zero\" has come under criticism for its nationalistic and sympathetic depiction of the Kamikaze pilots. Director Hayao Miyazaki in an interview accused the film of \"trying to make a Zero fighter story based on a fictional war account that is a pack of lies\". He added that this film was \"just continuing a phony myth\" and that he had \"hated that sort of thing ever since [I] was a kid.\" Kazuyuki Izutsu, the director of the 2005 film \"Pacchigi!\" said that the film had \"no basis in fact\". The film has also courted controversy amongst Japan's neighbors, especially China, with one Chinese commentator reportedly accusing the film of being \"propaganda for terrorism\".\n\n[4] Batman Eternal: In July 2014, Snyder revealed the story arc after \"Zero Year\" in \"Batman\", \"\", would take place after the events of \"Eternal\". He revealed that issue 34 would act as a way to catch readers up to the events of \"Eternal\", without spoiling the conclusion, while also setting up the new story arc that will run from \"Batman\" #35-40. Starting in October 2014, along with the \"Endgame\" storyline, most New 52 titles in the \"Batman\" family take place at the end of the \"Eternal\" storyline ending in April 2015. At the end of October, Snyder confirmed the series would go on hiatus after April 2015, and would return for a second year.\n\n[5] Persona 2: Eternal Punishment: The concept for \"Eternal Punishment\" emerged during the writing for \"Persona 2: Innocent Sin\". Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the impression of needing an alternate point of view to that of the main hero. This concept formed the basis for \"Eternal Punishment\"s plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from \"Eternal Punishment\" through minor roles in \"Innocent Sin\". \"Eternal Punishment\" began full development after the release of \"Innocent Sin\". \"Innocent Sin\" and \"Eternal Punishment\" both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, \"Innocent Sin\"s producer, returned in the same role. When developing \"Eternal Punishment\", the development team took what they learned from \"Innocent Sin\" and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making \"Eternal Punishment\" was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.\n\n[6] Underworld: The Eternal War: The storyline revolves around the eternal war between the vampires and lycans, and as the player, you can choose the side you're teaming with. You can either choose the movie's main character, the vampire Selene, or the lycan Raze. You can also choose between a selection of other vampires, other Lycans or the hybrid.\n\n[7] Eternals (comics): In 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics to work at DC Comics, where he began the saga of the New Gods, an epic story involving mythological and science fiction concepts, and planned to have a definite ending. However, the saga was left incomplete after the cancellation of the titles involved. Kirby began \"The Eternals\" when he returned to Marvel. The Eternals' saga was thematically similar to the New Gods', and the series was also eventually canceled without resolving many of its plots. Writers Roy Thomas and Mark Gruenwald used the Eternals in a \"Thor\" storyline that climaxed in \"Thor \"#301, resolving those lingering plotlines. Subsequent to the \"Thor\" storyline, the Eternals (and the mythology connected to them) have appeared or been mentioned in numerous Marvel comics. In particular, the Celestials' experiment on humanity has been used to explain how certain humans can develop super-powers. The Titanians (created by Jim Starlin) and Uranians (created by Stan Lee) were later retconned as being Eternals as well.\n\n[8] Naoki Hyakuta: In 2006 Hyakuta's novel \"The Eternal Zero\" was published. It became a best-seller, with four million copies sold. It was made into a popular 2013 movie. The novel was criticised by famed Studio Ghibli director Hayao Miyazaki as being \"a pack of lies\" about the war, leading to Hyakuta speculating that Miyazaki \"wasn't right in the head\".\n\n[9] Lunar: Eternal Blue: \"Lunar: Eternal Blue\" was developed by Game Arts and Studio Alex, with project director Yoichi Miyagi returning to oversee the production of the new game. According to scenario writer Kei Shigema, the game's concept of an oppressive god came from the image of Sun Wukong, hero of the Chinese epic \"Journey to the West\", being unable to escape from the gigantic palm of the Buddha. Shigema stated that \"it was a picture showing the arrogance of a god who is saying, 'In the end, you pathetic humans are in my hands.' The moment I understood that, I thought, 'Oh, I definitely want to do this,' it'll definitely match perfectly. So we used it just like that.\" \"Eternal Blue\" took three years and over US$2.5 million to produce, and contains twice as much dialogue as its precessor. The game's development team originally wanted the game to be set only a few years after \"The Silver Star\", and would feature slightly older versions of the previous cast along with the new characters, yet discarded the idea when they thought the new cast would lose focus. Like its predecessor, the game contains animated interludes to help tell the game's story, which were developed in-house with Toshiyuki Kubooka serving as animation director. While \"The Silver Star\" contained only ten minutes of partially voiced animation, \"Eternal Blue\" features nearly fifty minutes of fully voiced video content.\n\n[10] Eternal Eden: RPGFan rates Eternal Eden at 90/100 a few months later critic Neal Chandran awarded the game #1 of his Editor’s Pick choices of 2008. Gamertell praised the storyline of \"Eternal Eden\", with its \"message of redemption\" and use of \"religious archetypes\". Game Tunnel highlighted the game's music and artwork, with \"vivid and crisp\" environments, and \"massive, intimidating and detailed\" boss battles. The gameplay of \"Eternal Eden\", while typical of the genre, has drawn comparisons with classic JRPGs such as early \"Final Fantasy\" titles. However, reviews have criticized the English localization: the dialogue includes occasional grammatical errors and awkward delivery, with the game's JayIsGames review noting that the dialogue was \"awkward\" in places.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

When Florey and his team recognised the potential of the discovery for combating bacterial infection, they faced the problem of how to manufacture penicillin in sufficient quantities to be of use. Heatley, although the junior member of the team, possessed a natural gift for ingenuity and invention. It was he who suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity, thus purifying the penicillin.\n\n[2] Ernst Chain: In 1939, he joined Howard Florey to investigate natural antibacterial agents produced by microorganisms. This led him and Florey to revisit the work of Alexander Fleming, who had described penicillin nine years earlier. Chain and Florey went on to discover penicillin's therapeutic action and its chemical composition. Chain and Florey discovered how to isolate and concentrate the germ-killing agent in penicillin. Along with Edward Abraham he was also involved in theorising the beta-lactam structure of penicillin in 1942, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallography done by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1945. For this research, Chain, Florey, and Fleming received the Nobel Prize in 1945.\n\n[3] Roaring Twenties: For decades biologists had been at work on the medicine that became penicillin. In 1928, Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming discovered a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. In 1929, he named the new substance \"penicillin\". His publications were largely ignored at first, but it became a significant antibiotic in the 1930s. In 1930, Cecil George Paine, a pathologist at Sheffield Royal Infirmary, used penicillin to treat sycosis barbae, eruptions in beard follicles, but was unsuccessful. Moving on to ophthalmia neonatorum, a gonococcal infection in infants, he achieved the first recorded cure with penicillin, on November 25, 1930. He then cured four additional patients (one adult and three infants) of eye infections, but failed to cure a fifth.\n\n[4] Penicillin: Penicillin (PCN or pen) is a group of antibiotics which include penicillin G (intravenous use), penicillin V (use by mouth), procaine penicillin, and benzathine penicillin (intramuscular use). Penicillin antibiotics were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are still widely used today, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use. About 10% of people report that they are allergic to penicillin; however, up to 90% of this group may not actually be allergic. Serious allergies only occur in about 0.03%. All penicillins are β-lactam antibiotics. Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming. People began using it to treat infections in 1942. There are several enhanced penicillin families which are effective against additional bacteria; these include the antistaphylococcal penicillins, aminopenicillins and the antipseudomonal penicillins. They are derived from \"Penicillium\" fungi.\n\n[5] Alexander Fleming: Fleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the \"Fleming Myth\" and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir Henry Harris said in 1998: \"Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin.\"\n\n[6] Nobel Prize controversies: The 1945 prize was awarded to Ernst Boris Chain, Howard Florey and Alexander Fleming \"for the discovery of penicillin and its curative effect in various infectious diseases\". Fleming accidentally stumbled upon the then-unidentified fungal mold. However, some critics pointed out that Fleming did not in fact discover penicillin, that it was technically a rediscovery; decades before Fleming, Sir John Scott Burdon-Sanderson, William Roberts (physician), John Tyndall and Ernest Duchesne had already done studies and research on its useful properties and medicinal characteristics. Moreover, according to Fleming himself, the first known reference to penicillin was from Psalm 51: \"Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean\". Meanwhile, he had learned from mycologist Charles Thom (the same who helped Fleming establish the identity of the mysterious fungal mold) that \"Penicillium notatum\" was first recognized by Per Richard Westling, a Swedish pharmacist, from a specimen of decayed hyssop. In this award, as it had been pointed out, several deserving contemporaneous contributors had been left out of the Prize altogether.\n\n[7] Alexander Fleming: Fleming also discovered very early that bacteria developed antibiotic resistance whenever too little penicillin was used or when it was used for too short a period. Almroth Wright had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements: \"the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out ... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted.\" He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n[8] Antibiotic: Ernst Chain, Howard Florey and Edward Abraham succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was first proposed by Abraham in 1942 and then later confirmed by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. (see below) The development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety. For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, Chain and Florey shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Fleming.\n\n[9] Howard Florey: Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin, it was Florey who carried out the first ever clinical trials in 1941 of penicillin at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford on the first patient, a constable from Oxford. The patient started to recover but subsequently died because Florey was unable, at that time, to make enough penicillin. It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin, after the task had been abandoned as too difficult.\n\n[10] Gladys Lounsbury Hobby: Hobby is recognized for her work in creating a form of penicillin that was effective on human hosts. In 1940, Hobby and her colleagues, Dr. Karl Meyer and Dr. Martin Henry Dawson, wrote to Howard Florey and Ernst Chain to procure a sample of penicillin. They naively decided to make some penicillin and soon became experts in the fermentation process, and began refining it into a drug. Hobby, Meyer, and Dawson performed the first tests of penicillin on humans in 1940 and 1941, before presenting at the American Society for Clinical Investigation. They discovered that penicillin was a powerful germ-killer that reduced the severity of infectious diseases and made procedures such as organ transplantation and open-heart surgery possible. Their findings received media coverage, which helped attract funding from the United States Government to mass-produce penicillin during World War II, saving the lives of many soldiers.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Sixty years later, Guglielmo Marconi received the first trans-Atlantic radio signal on December 12, 1901, in St. John's, Newfoundland (now in Canada) using a kite-supported antenna for reception. The transmitting station in Poldhu, Cornwall, used a spark-gap transmitter to produce a signal with a frequency of approximately 500 kHz and a power of 100 times more than any radio signal previously produced. The message received was three dits, the Morse code for the letter S. To reach Newfoundland the signal would have to bounce off the ionosphere twice. Dr. Jack Belrose has contested this, however, based on theoretical and experimental work. However, Marconi did achieve transatlantic wireless communications in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, one year later.\n\n[2] Technological and industrial history of 20th-century Canada: In 1901, Guglielmo Marconi sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. He established a machine to produce electromagnetic waves at Cornwall in England and a machine to detect these waves at Signal Hill in St. John's Newfoundland. On 12 December 1901 he announced that he had received the transmission of waves sent by the transmitter in England at the station in St John’s.  In Montreal, in 1920, XWA (CINW (AM)) became the first commercial AM radio broadcaster in the world. Both the AM transmitter and receiver used analog technology. The following year CKAC became the first French- language AM radio broadcaster in Canada. State operated national radio broadcasting chains were established beginning in the late 1920s, including the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932 and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network, 1936. Private independent AM broadcast operations sprouted like mushrooms in cities large and small across Canada during the thirties and forties. Canadian Marconi Company (CMC Electronics) formed in Montreal in 1903 and Northern Electric, manufactured radios for home use, the first mass-produced electronic equipment in Canada. The circuits of these devises were based on analog technology.\n\n[3] Second Industrial Revolution: It was Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi who successfully commercialized radio at the turn of the century. He founded The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company in Britain in 1897 and in the same year transmitted Morse code across Salisbury Plain, sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea and made the first transatlantic transmission in 1901 from Poldhu, Cornwall to Signal Hill, Newfoundland. Marconi built high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic and began a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships in 1904.\n\n[4] Electrical engineering: During the development of radio, many scientists and inventors contributed to radio technology and electronics. The mathematical work of James Clerk Maxwell during the 1850s had shown the relationship of different forms of electromagnetic radiation including possibility of invisible airborne waves (later called \"radio waves\"). In his classic physics experiments of 1888, Heinrich Hertz proved Maxwell's theory by transmitting radio waves with a spark-gap transmitter, and detected them by using simple electrical devices. Other physicists experimented with these new waves and in the process developed devices for transmitting and detecting them. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi began work on a way to adapt the known methods of transmitting and detecting these \"Hertzian waves\" into a purpose built commercial wireless telegraphic system. Early on, he sent wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. In December 1901, he sent wireless waves that were not affected by the curvature of the Earth. Marconi later transmitted the wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of .\n\n[5] Radio Flyer: In 1930, the company was renamed \"Radio Steel & Manufacturing\". The renamed company produced steel-bodied wagons and used assembly line manufacturing techniques. The new \"Radio Flyer\" wagons were named as a tribute to two famous men of the day: Marconi and Lindbergh. Italian inventor and engineer Guglielmo Marconi developed, demonstrated, and marketed the first successful long-distance wireless telegraph and in 1901 broadcast the first transatlantic radio signal. Charles Lindbergh completed the first solo, non-stop flight across the Atlantic in 1927. Combining those two marvels, Pasin christened his new metal wagons \"Radio Flyer\".\n\n[6] John Ambrose Fleming: In 1899 Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of radiotelegraphy, decided to attempt transatlantic radio communication. This would require a scale-up in power from the small 200-400 watt transmitters Marconi had used up to then. He contracted Fleming, an expert in power engineering, to design the radio transmitter. Fleming designed the world's first large radio transmitter, a complicated spark transmitter powered by a 25 kW alternator driven by a combustion engine, built at Poldhu in Cornwall, UK, which transmitted the first radio transmission across the Atlantic on 12 December 1901. Although Fleming was responsible for the design, the director of the Marconi Co. had made Fleming agree that: \"If we get across the Atlantic, the main credit will be and must forever be Mr. Marconi's\". Accordingly, the worldwide acclaim that greeted this landmark accomplishment went to Marconi, who only credited Fleming along with several other Marconi employees, saying he did some work on the \"power plant\". Marconi also forgot a promise to give Fleming 500 shares of Marconi stock if the project was successful. Fleming was bitter about his treatment. He honoured his agreement and didn't speak about it throughout Marconi's life, but after his death in 1937 said Marconi had been \"very ungenerous\".\n\n[7] Telegraphy: On 13 May 1897, Marconi, assisted by George Kemp, a Cardiff Post Office engineer, transmitted the first wireless signals over water to Lavernock (near Penarth in Wales) from Flat Holm. The message sent was \"ARE YOU READY\". From his Fraserburgh base, he transmitted the first long-distance, cross-country wireless signal to Poldhu in Cornwall. His star rising, he was soon sending signals across The English channel (1899), from shore to ship (1899) and finally across the Atlantic (1901). A study of these demonstrations of radio, with scientists trying to work out how a phenomenon predicted to have a short range could transmit \"over the horizon\", led to the discovery of a radio reflecting layer in the Earth's atmosphere in 1902, later called the ionosphere.\n\n[8] Invention of radio: The Poldhu to Newfoundland transmission claim has been criticized. There are various science historians, such as Belrose and Bradford, who have cast doubt that the Atlantic was bridged in 1901, but other science historians have taken the position that this was the first transatlantic radio transmission. Critics have claimed that it is more likely that Marconi received stray atmospheric noise from atmospheric electricity in this experiment. The transmitting station in Poldhu, Cornwall used a spark-gap transmitter that could produce a signal in the medium frequency range and with high power levels.\n\n[9] Invention of radio: Marconi transmitted from England to Canada and the United States. In this period, a particular electromagnetic receiver, called the \"Marconi magnetic detector\" or \"hysteresis magnetic detector\", was developed further by Marconi and was successfully used in his early transatlantic work (1902) and in many of the smaller stations for a number of years. In 1902, a Marconi station was established in the village of Crookhaven, County Cork, Ireland to provide marine radio communications to ships arriving from the Americas. A ship's master could contact shipping line agents ashore to enquire which port was to receive their cargo without the need to come ashore at what was the first port of landfall. Ireland was also, due to its western location, to play a key role in early efforts to send trans-Atlantic messages. Marconi transmitted from his station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada across the Atlantic, and on 18 January 1903 a Marconi station sent a message of greetings from Theodore Roosevelt, the President of the United States, to the King of the United Kingdom, marking the first transatlantic radio transmission originating in the United States\n\n[10] USS Stringham (TB-19): On 26 July 1912, near Annapolis, Maryland, \"Stringham\" successfully received the first radio signal transmitted from an aircraft to a surface ship. Ensign Charles H. Maddox, USN, transmitted \"We are off the water, going ahead full speed on a course for the Naval Academy\" from an altitude of 300 feet to the \"Stringham\", distant three nautical miles. Later test messages from Maddox's \"Wright flyer style\" aircraft were received by \"Stringham\" at distances of up to 15 miles. Maddox later wrote, \"These were the first radio messages ever received from an airplane radio transmitting set in the United States and probably in the world.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWho played the scarecrow in the Wiz?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Scarecrow (Oz): Hinton Battle originated the role of the Scarecrow in the 1975 Broadway musical \"The Wiz\", and Michael Jackson played the Scarecrow in the 1978 film adaptation. This version of the Scarecrow was a more tragic character before Dorothy rescues him; while hung on his pole, the crows he is unable to scare, who force him to humiliate himself and entertain them, torment him day and night. They force him to sing the song, \"You Can't Win\", meaning that he cannot escape the crows' rule and his bad luck. While Stan Winston created Jackson's makeup, it was applied to Jackson's face by Michael R. Thomas who portrayed the Scarecrow in Barry Mahon's \"The Wonderful Land of Oz\" (1969), as well as doing the makeup for that film. Elijah Kelley portrayed the Scarecrow in the TV special \"The Wiz Live!\", as well as the farmhand Sticks.\n\n[2] Scarecrow: L. Frank Baum's tale \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" has a scarecrow as one of the main protagonists. The Scarecrow of Oz was searching for brains from the Great Wizard. The scarecrow was portrayed by Frank Moore in the 1914 film \"His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz\", by Ray Bolger in the 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\", and by Michael Jackson in the 1978 musical film adaptation \"The Wiz\".\n\n[3] You Can't Win (song): \"You Can't Win\" is an R&B, pop and soul song written by Charlie Smalls and performed by American recording artist Michael Jackson, who played Scarecrow in the 1978 musical film \"The Wiz\", an urbanized retelling of L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". The movie featured an entirely African American cast and was based on the 1975 Broadway musical \"The Wiz\".\n\n[4] You Can't Win (song): The scene that corresponds with \"You Can't Win\" in \"The Wiz\" begins with Dorothy Gale (played by Diana Ross), stumbling upon a scarecrow being heckled by crows while stuck in the air on a pole. Dorothy remains hidden while the crows mock Scarecrow for asking to be let down. They state that he will remain on the pole because that is his role and there is nothing to get down for. The crows tell Scarecrow that even if he was let down, he would not be able to walk as he is a \"straw paper dummy\". Scarecrow tries to reason with the birds by reading relevant quotations from figures such as Francis Bacon and Cicero as a rationale to be freed. The crows do not relent, however, and make him recite their \"Crow Commandments\": \"Thou shall honor all crows\", \"Thou shall stop reading all bits of paper and literature\" and \"Thou shall never, never get down off of this here pole\". In addition, the birds tell Scarecrow to sing the crow anthem, \"You Can't Win\". After the song concludes, Dorothy comes out of hiding and releases Scarecrow from the pole. Together, they then dance their way down the yellow brick road in search of The Wiz, singing \"Ease on Down the Road\" as they go.\n\n[5] Off the Wall: In 1978, Jackson starred as Scarecrow in the film musical \"The Wiz\". The musical scores were arranged by Quincy Jones, who formed a partnership with Jackson during the film's production and agreed to produce the singer's solo album \"Off the Wall\". Jackson was dedicated to the role, and watched videotapes of gazelles, cheetahs and panthers in order to learn graceful movements for his part. Jones recalled working with Jackson as one of his favorite experiences from \"The Wiz\", and spoke of Jackson's dedication to his role, comparing his acting style to Sammy Davis, Jr. Critics panned \"The Wiz\" upon its October 1978 release, but Jackson's performance as the Scarecrow was one of the only positively reviewed elements of the film, with critics noting that Jackson possessed \"genuine acting talent\" and \"provided the only genuinely memorable moments.\" Of the results of the film, Jackson stated: \"I don't think it could have been any better, I really don't\". In 1980, Jackson stated that his time working on \"The Wiz\" was \"my greatest experience so far...I'll never forget that\".\n\n[6] Wicket W. Warrick: Wicket was portrayed by Warwick Davis in 1983's \"Return of the Jedi\". The then 11-year-old actor came to be involved in the film after his grandmother heard a radio ad calling for short actors. Davis began work on the film in January 1982. Originally cast as a generic Ewok, Davis caught the eye of George Lucas with aspects of his performance, such as his ability to stick his tongue through his Ewok mask and the inquisitive tilting of his head (which was inspired by Davis' dog). Kenny Baker was originally set to take the role of Wicket; however, Baker fell ill with food poisoning, and Davis was called in as a replacement.\n\n[7] Zack Ward: He is known for his character Dave Scovil (Titus's stoner half-brother) on the FOX show \"Titus\" and as the bully Scut Farkus in the 1983 perennial Christmas movie \"A Christmas Story\". He also has guest roles on popular television series such as \"NCIS\", \"Lost\", and \"Crossing Jordan\". Ward has had roles in films such as \"Almost Famous,\" \"Transformers\" and \"Anne of Green Gables\". He has appeared in the horror films \"\" and \"Freddy vs. Jason\". Ward also has leading roles in \"\" and \"Postal\". Ward can also be seen in \"Alone in the Dark II\" and \"The Devil's Tomb\".\n\n[8] James Burrows: Burrows has had cameo appearances in several of the shows for which he has directed. In the first season of \"Friends\", Burrows appeared in the episode \"The One with the Butt\" as the director of the film in which the character Joey Tribbiani is cast as Al Pacino's \"butt double\". He also appears as a television director named Jimmy in the 2005 HBO series \"The Comeback\". Burrows played himself on the series. An episode of \"Scrubs\", \"My Life in Four Cameras\", had a character named Charles James in honor of \"Cheers\" creators Burrows and Glen and Les Charles. It was previously asserted in \"Sitcoms: the 101 Greatest TV Comedies of All Time\" (2007) that Burrows served as the silhouette of the customer who knocks on the door in the final scene of \"Cheers\", but Burrows himself refuted this claim on episode 9 of the \"NewsRadio\"-themed podcast Dispatches from Fort Awesome, revealing that the actual \"Man Who Knocks\" was agent Bob Broder.\n\n[9] Pat Walshe: On October 4, 1938, Walshe was cast in the most prominent role of his career. He was to make his feature film debut in \"The Wizard of Oz\". Due to Walshe's recognition for novelty performances dressed as animals and his expressive movement, Walshe was awarded the role of Nikko, the head king of the Winged Monkeys. Unlike the other monkeys, Nikko was a credited role, serving as the Wicked Witch's (played by Margaret Hamilton) second in command and minion. Though Walshe had no spoken lines, performing his character through physical performance, he did receive an on-screen credit (which was rare for bit players at the time). Instead of the simple stage makeup that Walshe used in his shows, he had to wear complex prosthetics designed by Jack Dawn. While the other monkeys wore simple rubber masks, Walshe's needed to appear in close-ups, so instead a multi-piece prosthetic makeup was produced. The prosthetics were moulded to Walshe's features and then glued to his face, with some appliances protruding out. Walshe also wore a full fur body suit, with a short open tunic as well as a tail and wings. Walshe is listed in the end credits as playing Nikko, and despite being featured frequently in the movie, the name Nikko is never mentioned in the film. In the book, the character is simply called \"the Monkey King\", so many viewers were unsure as to who the character was. Some confused Nikko with the Captain of the Winkie Guards (played by Mitchell Lewis), though it is evident that he was in fact the monkey, since Walshe was 3'10\" (like the monkey) and was well known for his animal impersonations.\n\n[10] The Moviegoers: Worth Wagers played with Steph Turner and Ethan Semone in Cow Lily, who released an EP on Hear Diagonally Records. Cow Lily also played SXSW in 2000 and were written about in Billboard Magazine. He then moved to Sydney, Australia where he joined Jason Walker & The Last Drinks, who released 3 CDs on Laughing Outlaw Records and played SXSW in 2004. Then moving to Boston, Massachusetts, he joined The Patrons, a country-R&B-soul group led by Jonah Kraut and Nowhere Lights, a space-folk-rock band; releasing records with both bands. Today he lives in London, England where he plays with indie folk/rock band, Golden Spike and is a DJ specializing in spinning Soul Music on 45.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

She holds a B.A. (History and Literature) from Harvard-Radcliffe, a J.D. from USC's Gould School of Law, and a Ph.D. in Jurisprudence & Social Policy from the University of California, Berkeley. She is also the author of The Cultural Defense (2004) which was first book-length study which provides a comprehensive overview of the debate surrounding the admissibility of cultural evidence in the courtroom. Renteln contends that the cultural defense should, in both criminal and civil matters, be given formal recognition.\n\n[2] Natália Correia: Natália de Oliveira Correia, (13 September 1923 in Fajã de Baixo (Ponta Delgada), São Miguel, Azores – 16 March 1993 in Lisbon) was an intellectual, poet and social activist, as well as author of the official lyrics of the \"Hino dos Açores\", the regional anthem of Autonomous Region of the Azores. Her work crossed various genres of Portuguese media, and collaborated with many Portuguese and international publications. A member of the Portuguese National Assembly (1980–1991), she regularly intervened politically on the side of arts and culture, in the defense of human rights and rights of women. Along with José Saramago, Armindo Magalhães, Manuel da Fonseca and Urbano Tavares Rodrigues, she helped to create the FNDC, \"Frente Nacional para a Defesa da Cultura\" (the National Front for the Defense of Culture). She was a central figure in the artistic scene, who met with peoples central to Portuguese culture and literature in the 1950s and 1960s. Her works have been translated into various languages.\n\n[3] Rožaje: In 1797 the Ganić kulla, a defensive measurement of the Islamified Kuči (Muslim members of the clan) who supported Muslim authority and culture, was built. Today the building is the town museum.\n\n[4] Dinesh D'Souza: In early 2007, D'Souza published \"The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and its Responsibility for 9/11\", in which he argues that the American cultural left was in large part responsible for the Muslim anger that led to the September 11 attacks. He argues that Muslims do not hate America because of its freedom and democracy, but because they perceive America to be imposing its moral depravity (support for sexual licentiousness) on the world. D'Souza's conclusion urges conservatives to condemn products of the American entertainment industry, asking \"why should the right stand up for the left's debased values? Why should our people defend their America? Rather, American conservatives should join the Muslims and others in condemning the global moral degeneracy that is produced by liberal values.\" The book was criticized in major American newspapers and magazines and described as, among other things, \"the worst nonfiction book about terrorism published by a major house since 9/11\" and \"a national disgrace\". D'Souza's book caused controversy in the conservative movement. His conservative critics widely mocked his thesis that the cultural left was responsible for 9/11. In response, D'Souza posted a 6,500-word essay on \"National Review Online\", and \"NRO\" subsequently published a litany of responses from conservative authors who accused D'Souza of character assassination, elitism and pseudo-intellectualism.\n\n[5] Han (cultural): Yanagi Sōetsu was an influential figure in colonial Korea, and was accepted as a true friend by contemporary Koreans; he sought to preserve the traditional art of Korea, held fund-raising lectures and concerts for humanitarian aid, and spoke out in defense of Korean people and cultural heritage. Moderate Korean nationalists, who had a non-confrontational approach toward Japanese authority, supported Yanagi, and the Dong-a Ilbo actively promoted and sponsored him. Yanagi was admired by prominent figures in the fields of history, art, and media, who had a profound influence on the formation of modern Korean concepts of traditional art, aesthetics, and history. The concept of \"han\", based on the \"beauty of sorrow\", was propagated by Korean scholars and writers, continuing Yanagi's legacy, and gradually spread to the entire education system. According to Jeong Il-seong, who authored a book about Yanagi Sōetsu, the passage of modern Korean history, going from the Japanese occupation to independence to national division to civil war then to the \"dark\" period of military dictatorships, influenced figures in art and culture to adopt the concept of \"han\".\n\n[6] The Defense: The novel appeared first under Nabokov's pen name V. Sirin in the Russian emigre quarterly \"Sovremennye Zapiski\" and was thereafter published by the emigre publishing house Slovo as \"Защита Лужина\" (The Luzhin Defense) in Berlin. More than three decades later the novel was translated into English by Michael Scammell in collaboration with Nabokov and appeared in 1964. In the foreword to the English edition Nabokov states that he wrote \"The Defense\" in 1929 while he vacationed in Le Boulou (\"hunting butterflies\") and then finished it in Berlin. He links the events in the central chapters to moves as encountered in chess problems.\n\n[7] Michael Dobbs (American author): Dobbs is the author of the \"Cold War trilogy\", a series of books about the climactic moments of the Cold War. His \"Down with Big Brother: The Fall of The Soviet Empire\" was a runner-up for the 1997 PEN award for nonfiction. His hour-by-hour study of the Cuban Missile Crisis, \"One Minute to Midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro on the Brink of Nuclear War\", was a finalist for the 2008 \"Los Angeles Times\" history prize and was named one of five non-fiction books of the year by \"The Washington Post\". The final book in the trilogy, \"Six Months in 1945: From World War to Cold War\" (Knopf, 2012), describes the division of Europe into American and Soviet spheres of influence after World War II.\n\n[8] Organizational structure of the United States Department of Defense: Article II Section 2 of the Constitution designates the President as \"Commander in Chief\" of the Army, Navy and state militias. The President exercises this supreme command authority through the civilian Secretary of Defense, who by federal law is the \"head of the department\", has \"authority direction, and control over the Department of Defense\", and is the \"principal assistant to the President in all matters relating to the Department of Defense.\" The Secretary's principal deputy is the equally civilian Deputy Secretary of Defense who is delegated full powers to act for the Secretary of Defense. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) is the Secretary and Deputy Secretary's civilian staff, which includes several Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries of Defense with functional oversight responsibilities. The Secretaries of the Military Departments (i.e. Secretary of the Army, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of the Air Force) are subordinate to the Secretary of Defense. They have the authority under Title 10 of the United States Code to \"conduct all the affairs\" of their respective departments (Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force) within which the military services are organized.\n\n[9] Balangiga bells: In August 2018, the US National Defense Authorization Act gave Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis the authority to decide on the matter, and he informed Congress that the Department of Defense intended to return the bells to the Philippines. That month the US Embassy in the Philippines issued a statement that the Department of Defense had notified Congress that it planned to return the bells to the Philippines at an unspecified date. Three months later, Rolando Borrinaga of the Philippines' National Commission for Culture and the Arts stated that the two bells at the Francis E. Warren Air Force Base would be turned over to Philippine representatives on 15 November 2018. The third bell in South Korea was also ready for repatriation. The two bells in Wyoming were then shipped to Philadelphia for restoration work before being sent to Japan, where they joined the third bell.\n\n[10] Iain Boal: He is one of the co-founders of the Retort collective, an association of radical writers, teachers, artists, and activists, which has existed in the Bay Area for the past two decades.

She originally worked at the company's branch in Stamford, Connecticut, but transferred to the Scranton branch after her boss, Josh Porter, left (in order to take an upper-management job at Staples) and the branch shut down to merge with the Scranton branch. During her time in Stamford, she became romantically interested in Jim, and upon their arrival to the Scranton branch following Stamford's closing, they began dating. Shortly after, however, Jim's recurring affections for Pam led to their breakup, and Karen's immediate departure from Scranton. She is now the Regional Manager of the Utica branch of Dunder Mifflin. Karen's ethnicity is deliberately made ambiguous and turned into a sort of running joke. The Italian ancestry implied by her last name is confirmed in \"The Merger,\" but prior to that, in the same episode, Dwight suggests that she may be Filipino. Michael then states that she's very exotic looking and asks if her father was a GI. In addition, she has spoken a little French (\"Grief Counseling\") and a Chinese dialect (deleted scene from \"Gay Witch Hunt\"). In her free time, Karen enjoys playing first-person shooter PC games. Her \"Call of Duty\" screen name is \"KarenTheJimSlayer.\" She prefers wearing pantsuits at the office rather than skirts. Like Jan Levinson, Karen is portrayed as an ambitious career woman – having gunned for a corporate vice president position and now serving as the regional manager of the Utica branch – though considerably more personable than Jan. Along with Pam Beesly, Karen is often objectified by several men in the Scranton Branch.

Her father, Dick, was born in St. Catharines, Ontario. A former All-Canadian football player for Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he played briefly for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League as an offensive lineman. After an injury ended his football career, he returned to Halifax to pursue an MBA degree at Dalhousie University, where he met his future wife, a medical student. While working for 7-Up in Ontario, Dick was transferred to the United States. Ultimately the family settled in Denver, Colorado, where Dick had a senior position with Coors Brewing Company. Franklin's mother suggested that her daughter consider competing for Canada to ease the pressure of qualifying for the U.S. National Team due to the competitive depth of American swimmers. Franklin, however, chose to represent the United States, citing her patriotism for her homeland.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

He served as the editor-in-chief of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review from 1955 to 1956, and then worked as a law clerk to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1956 to 1957. He has represented Pennsylvania for 25 years in the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and is chair of the Conference's Committee on International Legal Developments. He also participated in the recent revision of the Uniform Commercial Code. His recent work has focused on international commercial law, including aspects of the World Trade Organization's operations.\n\n[2] Jesse W. Curtis Sr.: In 1887, Curtis graduated with a Ph.B. in the first class that went completely through the University of Southern California (he was eventually their oldest living alumnus). In 1891, he received a LL.B. from the University of Michigan Law School. He then began private practice in San Bernardino with his father at Curtis, Oster & Curtis, and its progeny, where he remained for 23 years, except for a stint from 1899 to 1903 serving as District Attorney of San Bernardino County.\n\n[3] Patricia A.

Randall: Prior to 1910, the Michigan Physics Department had focused on precision metrology. Dr. Randall, who took all of his degrees at Michigan, initially specialized in that subject. In 1902, his PhD thesis measured the coefficient of expansion of quartz. During his 1910-11 sabbatical year in Tübingen, Germany he met Friedrich Paschen and became an expert in infrared spectroscopy. Quantum mechanics did not yet exist as a field, and the study of atomic spectra was largely \"ad hoc\" experimentation with very little theoretical underpinning. This was also the training Randall received as a young physicist. But Randall came home from his 1910 sabbatical at Tubingen with new ideas (as well as some new equipment Paschen had helped him develop), and went on to lead a radical overhaul of physics research at Michigan.\n\n[5] Larry Metz: Metz was born in Abington, Pennsylvania, and moved to the state of Florida in 1968. He then attended the University of Florida, where he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in 1976.

In 1992, Metz ran for Congress against incumbent Democratic Congressman Harry Johnston in the newly created 19th District, but he lost to Johnston, receiving only 37% of the vote. When State Representative Carey Baker opted to run for the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election in the 25th District, which included northern Lake County and a few segments in northern Seminole County and southern Volusia County, Metz ran to succeed him in 2004. He faced Alan Hays, Johnny Barto Smith, Randy Wiseman, and JoAnn Huggins in the Republican primary. Ultimately, Metz narrowly lost to Hays, winning 29% of the vote to Hays's 35%. Later that year, in 2004, he was appointed by Governor Jeb Bush to serve on the Lake County School Board, and he was re-elected to that position in 2006. During his second term, he served two consecutive years as Chairman of the Board.\n\n[6] Thomas Rex Lee: After receiving his law degree, Lee served as law clerk to J.

Richardson: Richardson earned his Bachelor of Science from Vanderbilt University and his Juris Doctor, with high honors, from the University of Chicago Law School, where he served as articles editor of the \"University of Chicago Law Review\". After graduating from law school, Richardson served as a law clerk to Judge Richard Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist. Richardson then worked for three years at Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, where he handled complex civil litigation. In 2009, he became an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of South Carolina, where he prosecuted criminal cases and was Deputy Criminal Chief before becoming a judge.

The Megalithic Temples of Malta are among the most ancient religious sites on Earth, described by the World Heritage Sites committee as \"unique architectural masterpieces.\" In 1992 UNESCO recognized Ħaġar Qim and four other Maltese megalithic structures as World Heritage Sites. V. Gordon Childe, Professor of Prehistoric European Archeology and director of the Institute of Archaeology in the University of London from 1946-1957 visited Ħaġar Qim. He wrote, \"I have been visiting the prehistoric ruins all round the Mediterranean, from Mesopotamia to Egypt, Greece and Switzerland, but I have nowhere seen a place as old as this one.\"\n\n[2] Megalithic Temples of Malta: The Ġgantija temples (two sites) were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. In 1992, the UNESCO Committee further extended the existing listing to include five other megalithic temple sites. These are Ħaġar Qim (in Qrendi), Mnajdra (in Qrendi), Ta' Ħaġrat Temples (in Mġarr), Skorba Temples (in Żebbiegħ) and Tarxien Temples (in Tarxien). Nowadays, the sites are managed by Heritage Malta, while ownership of the surrounding lands varies from site to site. Apart from these, there are other megalithic temples in Malta which are not included in the UNESCO World Heritage list.\n\n[3] List of World Heritage sites in Malta: Sites in Malta were first inscribed on the list at the 4th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Paris, France in 1980. At that session, all three current sites were added to the list: the Ħal Saflieni Hypogeum, City of Valletta, and Ġgantija Temples. In 1992, the temples of Ħaġar Qim, Mnajdra, Ta' Ħaġrat, Skorba, and Tarxien were added to the site of Ġgantija Temples, to form the Megalithic Temples of Malta site. Further minor modification of boundaries of this site took place in 2015. All three sites are listed as cultural sites, as determined by the organization's selection criteria.\n\n[4] Freiha: The site was subjected to investigations by Qatari archaeologists in the 2005. More recently in 2009, the QMA, jointly with the University of Copenhagen, launched the Qatar Islamic Archaeology and Heritage Project (QIAH), a ten-year research, conservation and heritage initiative, to investigate sites in the Al Zubarah hinterland. The project is an initiative by the Qatar Museums Authority’s Chairperson H.E. Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa AlThani and Vice-Chairperson H.E. Sheikh Hassan bin Mohammad Al Thani. The QIAH project has carried out a complete topographic survey of the site of Freiha, allowing a map to be produced. This has led to a new series of excavations on the site, targeted at a central mosque, several domestic structures, and middens (rubbish dumps) surrounding the settlement.\n\n[5] Cisterns of La Malga: As part of the site of Carthage, the cisterns are classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO. On 17 February 2012, the Tunisian government proposed that the whole Zaghouan-Carthage Roman hydraulic complex, of which they are a part, should be classed as a world heritage site.\n\n[6] Mnajdra: Mnajdra () is a megalithic temple complex found on the southern coast of the Mediterranean island of Malta. Mnajdra is approximately 500 metres from the Ħaġar Qim megalithic complex. Mnajdra was built around the fourth millennium BCE; the Megalithic Temples of Malta are among the most ancient religious sites on Earth, described by the World Heritage Sites committee as \"unique architectural masterpieces.\" In 1992 UNESCO recognized the Mnajdra complex and four other Maltese megalithic structures as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2009 work was completed on a protective tent.\n\n[7] Taliesin (studio): In the late 1980s, Taliesin and Taliesin West were together nominated as a World Heritage Site, a UNESCO designation for properties with special worldwide significance. The nomination was rejected because the organization wanted to see a larger nomination with more Wright properties. In 2008, the National Park Service submitted the Taliesin estate along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties to a tentative list for World Heritage Status, which the National Park Service says is \"a necessary first step in the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List.\" The properties are expected to first become eligible for the designation in 2016. In 1987, the National Park Service evaluated the 1,811 NHLs nationwide for historical integrity and threat of damage. Taliesin was declared a \"Priority 1\" NHL, a site that is \"seriously damaged or imminently with such damage.\" Furthermore, the site was listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of America's Most Endangered Places in 1994, citing its \"water damage, erosion, foundation settlement and wood decay.\" Taliesin Preservation, Inc. (TPI), a non-profit organization, was established in 1991 to restore Taliesin.\n\n[8] Bahá'í World Centre buildings: Many Bahá'í holy places in Haifa and around Acre, including the terraces and the Shrine of the Báb on the north slope on Mount Carmel, and the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh, the Mansion of Bahji, and the Mansion at Mazra'ih were inscribed on the World Heritage List in July 2008. The Bahá'í shrines \"are the first sites connected with a relatively new religious tradition to be recognized by the World Heritage List.\" The UNESCO World Heritage Committee considers the sites to be \"of outstanding universal value [and]...inscribed for the testimony they provide to the Bahá’i’s strong tradition of pilgrimage and for their profound meaning for the faith.\"\n\n[9] Qatar Museums Authority: Qatar Museums is one of the organizations carrying out Qatar's National Vision 2030 program for comprehensive development, progress and prosperity for Qatar. Heritage-led developments play a key role in this program, for among its challenges is the wish to mold modernization around local culture and traditions, maintaining Arab and Islamic identity while showing openness towards other cultures. Sheikha Al Mayassa's mission is for Qatar Museums to turn Qatar into a cultural powerhouse. The Economist reported that a trustee said: “Above all, we want the QMA to be a ‘cultural instigator', a catalyst of arts projects worldwide”. The implementation of cultural policies by the QMA contributed to Doha been named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2010, an initiative taken by the Arab League under the UNESCO.\n\n[10] Citadel of Erbil: On 8 January 2010, the HCECR and the Iraqi State Board for Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) submitted the Citadel of Erbil to the Iraqi Tentative List of sites that are considered for nomination as World Heritage Site. The submission states that \"The Citadel is today one of the most dramatic and visually exciting cultural sites not only in the Middle East but also in the world.\" Two further agreements between the HCECR and UNESCO were signed in March 2010, and it was disclosed that Arbil Governorate will finance the restoration project with US$13 million. The first restoration works were carried out in June 2010. The Citadel was inscribed on the World Heritage List on 21 June 2014. In January 2017, UNESCO indicated that the site could be removed from the list due to the slow progress being made in the restoration program.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nIn which year the Old Town Hall was converted into City Hall?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Lancaster City Museum: The Old Town Hall building in which the museum is housed is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It was designed by Major Thomas Jarrett and built between 1781 and 1783, with a cupola added in 1782 to a design by Thomas Harrison. It was extended in 1871 and 1886. In 1910, the functions of the Town Hall were transferred to a new building in nearby Dalton Square. The old Town Hall was converted into a museum in 1923.\n\n[2] Sheffield Old Town Hall: The Old Town Hall was designed by Charles Watson and built in 1807–08. It was designed to house not only the Town Trustees but also the Petty and Quarter Sessions. Initially building was of five bays and faced Castle Street. It was extended in 1833 and again in 1866 to designs by William Flockton (1804–64) of Sheffield and his partner George Abbott. The most prominent feature was the new central clock tower over a new main entrance that reoriented the building to Waingate, the materials of which came from the parts of the building which had been demolished. At the same time the building's courtrooms were linked by underground passages to the neighbouring Sheffield Police Offices. The first Town Council was elected in 1843 and took over the lease of the Town Trustees' hall in 1866. The next year the building was extensively renovated and the clock tower designed by Flockton & Abbott was added. By the 1890s Sheffield's administration had again outgrown the building, and the current Sheffield Town Hall was built further south. The Old Town Hall was again extended in 1896–97, by the renamed Flockton, Gibbs & Flockton, and became Sheffield Crown Court and Sheffield High Court. The drinking fountain on the Castle Street side of the building was added at this time. In 1973 the Old Town Hall was made a Grade II listed building.\n\n[3] Old Town Hall, Halle (Saale): As early as 1312 a half-timbered Town Hall (German: Altes Rathaus) had been built on the market square in Halle (Saale) on the Saale River, east-central Germany. In 1466 a stone building was constructed. Later on the Town Hall was subject to several transformations. The architect Nickel Hoffmann added Renaissance features to the Gothic architecture style building. The south wing of the Town Hall, dating from the 16th century, was substituted by the Baroque wing in 1702, decorated by a grand entrance portal. On 31 March 1945 an air raid damaged parts of Halle (Saale)’s Old Town Hall and of the Old Weighing House (German: Alte Waage \"or\" Ratswaage). These buildings with their variety of architectural styles were demolished. The site of the Old Town Hall is now an unbuilt area with the foundation walls beneath. Since 2001 a free-standing bronze sculpture of the Old Town Hall, created by Cathleen Meier, has commemorated this building. This piece of art, financed entirely by donations, is situated on the former location of the Baroque wing in front of the City Council Building (German: Ratshof) which used to be the Old Town Hall’s rear building. In 2006 the triptych “The Council’s Loggia” (German: Ratsloggia) produced by Maya Graber and funded publicly, was unveiled at the historic site of this loggia. The latest tribute to this remarkable municipal building is a huge chocolate Town Hall shown in the museum of Halle (Saale)’s Halloren Chocolate Factory (German: \"Halloren Schokoladenfabrik AG\").\n\n[4] New Town Hall (Hanover): The New Town Hall () or New City Hall in Hanover, Germany, is a city hall and was opened on July 20, 1913, after having been under construction for 12 years. It is a magnificent, castle-like building of the era of Wilhelm II in eclectic style at the southern edge of the inner city (outside of the historic city centre of Hanover). The building is embedded in the 10 hectare Maschpark. The Old Town Hall is no longer used as the main seat of administration, but houses businesses and the registry office.\n\n[5] Somerville City Hall: The oldest portion of the building, its central core, was built in 1852, and was basically Greek Revival in character. This portion was used as the town's first high school until 1867, when a fire in the old town office building forced a relocation of those offices to this building's upper floor. The building was permanently dedicated as city hall after the construction of a new high school building (no longer extant, set on part of the area occupied by the present high school) in 1872, and the town was reincorporated as a city. The space once occupied by the police station in this building was converted for use as the city's first public library in 1873, eventually relocating to a dedicated building (also no longer extant) between it and the high school in 1885.\n\n[6] Old Town Hall, Munich: The building, documented for the first time in 1310, had its \"Grand Hall\" (Großer Saal) constructed in 1392/1394. The former \"Talburg Gate\" (Talburgtor) of the first city wall serves as spire. The Old Town Hall was re-designed in late-gothic style by Jörg von Halsbach 1470-1480. The Grand Hall was decorated by the Morris dancers, created by Erasmus Grasser. After alterations of the facade during the Renaissance and again in the Baroque the building was restored in neo-gothic style 1861-1864. In 1874 the municipality moved to the New Town Hall.\n\n[7] Wellington Town Hall: In 1980 the Michael Fowler Centre was built immediately in front of the Town Hall's main entrance in anticipation of the older building's demolition. However the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (since renamed to Heritage New Zealand) persuaded the City Council to retain the Town Hall. In 1989 plans were unveiled to create Civic Square between the town hall and the old city library. As part of this, the Town Hall underwent full refurbishment in 1991-1992. During this process the concert chamber was demolished and replaced with reception rooms.\n\n[8] Old City Hall (Toronto): Despite its size, Old City Hall proved inadequate for Toronto's growing municipal government within a couple of decades of completion. Under Mayor Nathan Phillips, Toronto City Council launched an international design competition for a new city hall and public square across Bay Street and completed a striking Modernist city hall and public square in 1965. Soon after in the 1960s, plans were made to start construction of the Toronto Eaton Centre. The original plans called for Old City Hall to be demolished and replaced by a retail complex, and a number of skyscrapers around a large plaza, leaving only the cenotaph (or in one plan, the clock tower) in the front. Public outcry forced authorities to abandon these plans, and the Eaton Centre was constructed around the landmark civic building and the Church of the Holy Trinity (which was also slated for demolition). Old City Hall then became a dedicated courthouse.\n\n[9] Camrose, Alberta: Camrose became a city on January 1, 1955. By 1958, Camrose had converted the old post office into the new City Hall. In 1954, however, Camrose had sold the old town hall to the federal government, so in the interim the city council met for almost three years in the hall of the local Methodist Church.\n\n[10] Columbus City Hall (Ohio): In 1921, a fire destroyed the old City Hall, built in 1872 at East State and Third Streets, now the site of the Ohio Theatre. James John Thomas, mayor of Columbus from 1920 to 1931, laid the cornerstone for a new City Hall on October 29, 1926. The building was dedicated on April 18, 1928. The five-story building, constructed of Indiana limestone, was designed by the Allied Architects Association of Columbus in the Neoclassical Revival style and built at a cost of US$1.7 million, equivalent to $ million in . Allied Architects also designed the adjacent Central Police Station building at West Gay Street and Marconi Boulevard, which opened on March 26, 1930, was abandoned in 1991 with the opening of a new police headquarters building, and was renovated in 2012 to allow the consolidation of various city government offices. City Hall was originally also the venue for the city's Municipal Court, and its proximity to the Police Station building provided for efficient movement of prisoners between the two buildings. Initially built in three sections surrounding a central courtyard, a fourth section was added on the east side of City Hall in 1936 to enclose the courtyard and provide additional office space. The structure was further renovated in 1949.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

The reserve is located along the Salamonie River in Blackford County, Indiana. The Miami Tribe was forced to move west to Kansas, but several tribal leaders, all of mixed French Canadian and Native American heritage, were allotted land in Indiana, an exception explained by their history of cooperation with the US and their willingness to participate in government attempts to \"civilize\" them. The reserve land was occupied as an Indian reservation between about 1814 and 1834, after which Chief Godfroy left because white neighbors repeatedly encroached upon the land and because of the conditions of the Treaty of 1834 between Indiana and the Miamis who remained.\n\n[2] Montpelier, Indiana: The former Godfroy Reservation, an Indian reservation for Chief Francis Godfroy and Miami Indians from 1827 until 1836, is located on the Salamonie River near Montpelier. (Francis is the English pronunciation of Godfroy's real name François. The Indian pronunciation of François was Palonzwa.) Godfroy's father was French, and his mother was from the Miami tribe. A big man at six feet tall and 300 pounds, Godfroy was the last war chief of the Miami Nation. A sculpture of an Plains Indian stands in downtown Montpelier, donated by Chief Larry Godfroy. The sculpture was seen in the introductory montage on the television program \"Parks and Recreation\". The “Ice Cream Giant” at the former Point Restaurant north of Montpelier was also featured in this clip.\n\n[3] Blackford County, Indiana: Following thousands of years of varying cultures of indigenous peoples, the historic Miami and Delaware Indians (a.k.a. Lenape) are the first-recorded permanent settlers in the Blackford County area, living on the Godfroy Reserve after an 1818 treaty. The site is located in Blackford County's Harrison Township, east of Montpelier. Although the Godfroy Reserve was allotted to Miami Indian Chief Francois (a.k.a. Francis) Godfroy, Delaware Indians were also allowed to stay there. The Miami tribe was the most powerful group of Indians in the region, and Francois Godfroy (who was half French) was one of their chiefs. By 1839, Godfroy had sold the reserve, and the Indians had migrated west. Benjamin Reasoner was the first European–American to enter future Blackford County, and its first land owner. He entered the area on July 9, 1831. Reasoner and his sons built the county's first mill, on their farm.\n\n[4] History of Hartford City, Indiana: The Miami tribe was the most powerful group of Indians in the region around the future Hartford City. Little Turtle (see picture) was the last great Miami warrior, dying in 1812. Francois Godfroy (he was half French) was one of the leaders of the area Miami Indians in the east central Indiana region after Indiana became a state, and he maintained a residence in what became northern Blackford County. The Miami and Delaware Indians are credited as being the first settlers of the Blackford County area, living about 9 miles (12 current highway miles) from the future Hartford City on the Godfroy Reserve after an 1818 treaty. The site is located in Blackford County's Harrison Township. Although the Godfroy Reserve was allotted to Miami Indian Chief Francois (a.k.a. Francis) Godfroy, Delaware Indians were also allowed to stay at the Reserve.\n\n[5] Godfroy Reserve: The text of the marker reads: Reserved by U.S. to Chief Francois Godfroy of the Miami Nation of Indians by treaty at St. Mary's, Ohio, 6 October 1818, 3, 840 acres on Salamonie River at La Petite Prairie, Harrison Township, Blackford County; reserve lands sold 1827, 1836.\n\n[6] Godfroy Reserve: The history of the Reserve and of Chief Godfroy is detailed in \"History of Jay County, Indiana: including its World War record\".\n\n[7] Miami Indian (sculpture): The piece was originally installed at a Pontiac dealer, in the 1960s, which was located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The sculpture was supposed to represent Chief Pontiac. It was moved to a museum in Bismarck, North Dakota in the 1970s. Eventually, the piece was moved back to Indiana, and to Eagle Creek Park, where a museum resided. It sat outside the entrance of a Native American museum. Eventually, the statue was given to Chief Larry Godfroy of the Miami people. The piece is now located in downtown Montpelier, where it was dedicated in January, 1984. In 1985, the sculpture was donated by Chief Godfroy to the city of Montpelier, which resided near ancestral lands of the Miami.\n\n[8] Francis Godfroy Cemetery: Francis Godfroy Cemetery is a historic cemetery located in Butler Township, Miami County, Indiana. The cemetery was established in 1812 on the site of a Miami Nation village and Chief Francis Godfroys council chambers.\n\n[9] Montpelier, Indiana: Like many boom towns, the city's population has never matched that of the boom years. The city's population was 1,805 at the 2010 census. However, the city's population stabilized many decades ago, and the community has multiple industries and an active community association. Montpelier is located near the former Godfroy Indian Reservation, and a statue of an Indian is featured prominently in the downtown district.\n\n[10] Francis Godfroy: After the War of 1812, Godfroy turned increasingly to trade, in partnership with the Miamis' principal chief, Jean Baptiste Richardville. In 1823 he had a two-story trading post built at the mouth of the Mississinewa, which was kept well stocked with merchandise. Until 1827 he alternated residences between the post, known as Mount Pleasant, and his treaty reserve in today's Blackford County, Indiana. As a mixed-blood trader well aware of the value of land and merchandise, he became influential with Richardville in brokering the sale of tribal land at treaty councils held in 1826, 1834 at the Treaty at the Forks of the Wabash, and 1838. From 1818 to 1838, Godfroy was given a total of seventeen sections of land (10,880 acres) and $17,612 in payment for services as chief and for the debts of tribespeople to his trading post, as well as a house and other gifts.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Serving a diverse community, the Museum collects, exhibits, preserves, and interprets its collections of 19th- and 20th-century paintings, works on paper, sculpture, and material culture from the region. The mission of the museum is to serve the community by \"maintaining, preserving, and interpreting the region's cultural heritage.\" In order to stimulate community participation in the visual arts, and to reflect the cultural diversity of New Jersey, the Jersey City Museum gives special attention to the exhibition of contemporary art, and recognizes the many visual artists who make their home in New Jersey and the neighboring metropolitan area. The collection includes the large body of work of painter August Will.\n\n[2] Jersey City Museum: The Jersey City Museum dates back to 1901, when it was located on the fourth floor of the Jersey City Free Public Library on Jersey Avenue. It remained under the aegis of the Library until 1987, when the Museum Association initiated efforts for the founding of a separate institution. In 1993, the Jersey City Redevelopment Agency donated the building at 350 Montgomery Street. Jersey City historian J. Owen Grundy served five times as the museum's president. The museum relocated to it new location in 2001.\n\n[3] Jersey City Medical Center: Located at the Jersey City Medical Center. A full range of services, individual, group, marital, family, psychological testing, and medication management are available for children, adolescents and adults who present with emotional, psychiatric, behavioral, interpersonal, or post traumatic issues. Anger management and Domestic Violence groups are available for men and women. Addiction treatment services and drug testing/monitoring are available for adults, including intensive outpatient groups, and after care. A School Based Clinic at Snyder High School provides onsite counseling services.\n\n[4] New Jersey City University: NJCU has a large population of commuter students, currently 97% of undergraduates. There is a bus service on Kennedy Boulevard along routes 10 and 99 south to Bayonne or north to Journal Square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Along West Side Avenue, New Jersey Transit #80 and other local buses provide frequent service to Journal Square. At Journal Square Transportation Center transfer is available to points in Hudson County, Manhattan, Newark, and suburban New Jersey via bus service provided by New Jersey Transit or train service on the PATH rail system. Local buses such as the Society Hill, and the 440 Shopper Square can be taken from the west side ave side of the campus to head to Journal Square. The most common method used by commuters is to take the PATH rail system to West Side Avenue.\n\n[5] Forked River, New Jersey: NJ Transit provides bus service to Atlantic City on the 559 bus route. Academy Bus provided bus service to Jersey City and New York City on the Parkway Express. Local bus service is provided by Ocean Ride.\n\n[6] Jersey City Ferry: The Jersey City Ferry was a major ferry service that operated between Jersey City and Cortland Street in lower Manhattan for almost 200 years (1764-1949). The ferry was notable for being the first to use steam power which began in 1812. The ferry's history was closely tied to the Pennsylvania Railroad's station in Jersey City at Exchange Place, which gradually fell into disuse after the railroad opened the North River Tunnels and Penn Station in 1910. Ferry service from lower Manhattan to Jersey City continued via the even older Communipaw ferry which operated from the adjacent Liberty Street Ferry Terminal until this service was also discontinued in 1967. In 1986 ferry service was revived and today it is operated by New York Waterway.\n\n[7] Morris and Essex Railroad: The M&E was incorporated January 29, 1835, to build a line from Newark in Essex County west to and beyond Morristown in Morris County. The first section, from Newark west to Orange, opened on November 19, 1836. Under an agreement signed on October 21, the New Jersey Rail Road provided connecting service from Newark east to Jersey City via the Bergen Hill Cut. The original connection between the two lines was in downtown Newark; the M&E turned south on Broad Street to meet a branch of the NJRR at Market Street. Service to Paulus Hook in what is today Jersey City commenced on October 14, 1836 and passengers could transfer to the Jersey City Ferry and cross to lower Manhattan at the nearby ferry slips.\n\n[8] North Jersey Rail Commuter Association: Over time, NJRCA has advocated a number of projects involving NJ Transit Rail Operations (or other entities), including the restoration of rail service on the Lackawanna Cut-Off; the extension of service to Hackettstown, NJ; creation of Midtown Direct service (via the Kearny Connection) to New York City; creation of service via the Montclair Connection, the opening of NYS&W railroad service through Northern New Jersey; the building of a NJ Transit rail yard in Morrisville, PA; and the preservation of the Sussex Branch Trail. The group was also successful in spearheading a 1989 state bond issue that set aside $25 million for the acquisition of railroad right-of-ways in the State of New Jersey. Additionally, the group has advocated for the creation of a railroad and transportation museum in New Jersey and was successful in gaining support for designating the museum jointly in Netcong-Port Morris and Phillipsburg.\n\n[9] Hornblower Cruises: In 2007 the company was awarded a concession from the National Park Service to operate ferries to Liberty Island and Ellis Island, the only public access to the national historic sites in the Port of New York and New Jersey. Under the name Statue Cruises, the company provides ticketing service and transportation for visitors to the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island Immigration Museum. Boats depart from either Communipaw Terminal, Liberty State Park in Jersey City or Castle Clinton, Battery Park in Lower Manhattan. The affiliated Liberty Water Taxi operates between Liberty State Park and the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal.\n\n[10] Hoboken Fire Department: The Hoboken Fire Department provides fire protection and first responder emergency medical service to the city of Hoboken, New Jersey. Additionally, all of Hoboken's firehouses, including the Fire Museum, are on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

A botanist, plant scientist or phytologist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \"botany\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\"botanē\") meaning \"pasture\", \"grass\", or \"fodder\"; is in turn derived from (\"boskein\"), \"to feed\" or \"to graze\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists (in the strict sense) study approximately 410,000 species of land plants of which some 391,000 species are vascular plants (including ca 369,000 species of flowering plants), and ca 20,000 are bryophytes.\n\n[2] Branches of science: Botany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms. The term \"botany\" comes from Greek βοτάνη, meaning \"pasture, grass, fodder\", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.\n\n[3] Branches of botany: Botany is a natural science concerned with the study of plants. The main branches of botany (also referred to as \"plant science\") are commonly divided into three groups: core topics, concerned with the study of the fundamental natural phenomena and processes of plant life, the classification and description of plant diversity; applied topics which study the ways in which plants may be used for economic benefit in horticulture, agriculture and forestry; and organismic topics which focus on plant groups such as algae, mosses or flowering plants.\n\n[4] History of botany: Botany (Greek - grass, fodder; Medieval Latin \"\" – herb, plant) and zoology are, historically, the core disciplines of biology whose history is closely associated with the natural sciences chemistry, physics and geology. A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology – that is, external form, internal structure, and functional operation. The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, pharmacognosy, economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more.\n\n[5] Botany (disambiguation): Botany is the scientific study of plant life.\n\n[6] List of life sciences: Some life sciences focus on a specific type of organism. For example, zoology is the study of animals, while botany is the study of plants. Other life sciences focus on aspects common to all or many life forms, such as anatomy and genetics. Some focus on the micro scale (e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry) other on larger scales (e.g. cytology, immunology, ethology, ecology). Another major, branch of life sciences involves understanding the mindneuroscience.\n\n[7] M. S. Balakrishnan: Some examples of his contributions are life history studies in Batrachospermum, studies on taxonomy and reproduction in Solieriaceae, cytology and life history of Indian Scytosiphonaceae, limnology of some of the lakes, algae in relation to water pollution, air borne algae etc. After his superannuation two of his students Professor B. B. Chaugule and Professor V. R. Gunale followed the path set by him while paying attention to current developments in Algology. In 1970 he took charge as Head of the Department of Botany, Poona University, and in 1972 he was appointed as Professor of Botany. In this capacity he continued until his retirement in 1978. During his tenure, the Department of Botany flourished with the introduction of modern disciplines, and he gradually built up a research tradition in Phycology. He also guided quite a few students, some in branches other than Phycology, for the Ph.D. Degree of the University of Poona. In 1978, he was at Shivaji University Kolhapur continuing his teaching and research activities. From 1980 to 1986 he was in the Centre of Advanced Studies in Botany at the Madras University working on Indian marine algae.\n\n[8] Botany: The strictest definition of \"plant\" includes only the \"land plants\" or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, known as the gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for at least part of its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (mycology) – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.\n\n[9] History of biology: Before \"biology\", there were several terms used for the study of animals and plants. \"Natural history\" referred to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included mineralogy and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the \"scala naturae\" or Great Chain of Being. \"Natural philosophy\" and \"natural theology\" encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the way they do, though these subjects also included what is now geology, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. \"Botany\", \"zoology\", and (in the case of fossils) \"geology\" replaced \"natural history\" and \"natural philosophy\" in the 18th and 19th centuries before \"biology\" was widely adopted. To this day, \"botany\" and \"zoology\" are widely used, although they have been joined by other sub-disciplines of biology.\n\n[10] Botany, New South Wales: Port Botany is the site of Sydney's major port and as such, Botany is a suburb with extensive commercial development centred on shipping and freight. Botany also has a large chemical production facility owned by several companies including Huntsman and Orica (previously ICI). The plant was built in the 1940s and has been owned by Orica since 1997. The plant once manufactured paints, plastics and industrial chemicals such as solvents, and is responsible for a large groundwater plume of pollution in the area. The main shopping centre in Botany runs along Botany Road. Sir Joseph Banks Park comprises Foreshore Reserve and the Sir Joseph Banks Pleasure Gardens. Foreshore Reserve is 28 hectares of bushland on land reclaimed from Botany Bay. The Reserve features walking tracks through sand dunes to protected wetlands, formed around a network of ponds. The Pleasure Gardens reflect the history of the area with a zoo playground featuring life size animal statues, a mosaic depicting Banks’s journey, decorative flag terrace, Banksia garden and the central oval running track. A statue of Sir Joseph Banks examining botanical specimens is located in the pleasure gardens.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

As the oldest Theravada Buddhist country in the world, several forest traditions and lineages had been existed, disappeared and re-emerged circularly in Sri Lanka. The current forest traditions and lineages in Sri Lanka have been influenced by the Thai and Burmese traditions which descend from the ancient jambudeepa (Indian) and Seehaladeepa (Sri Lankan) traditions.  After the era of great Indian Emperor Asoka, India lost her place as the Theravada Buddhist center of the world. It is said that emperor Asoka and his advisor monks predicted this would happen and organized a Theravada Buddhist Mission to nine countries in Asia. As a result of this mission, the great arahant Mahinda who was the son of emperor Asoka was sent to Sri Lanka in order to establish Buddha Sasana (message of the Lord Buddha) with a group consists with six arahants called Ittiya, Uttiya, Sambala, Bhaddasala, Novice Sumana (Sumana Samanera) and anagami layman Bhanduka (Bhanduka Upasaka).\n\n[2] Sri Lankan Forest Tradition: Early days the forest traditions were affiliated with the ancient monasteries such as Mihintale monastery, Ritigala monastery, Dimbulagala Monastery .. etc. Many ruins of ancient forest monasteries can be seen in the large forest areas of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Matale, Tissamaharama, Situlpawwa and Ruhuna. In that days Sri Lanka was the center of both Theravada village and forest traditions in the world. Currently the largest forest sect in Sri Lanka is the Sri Kalyani Yogashrama Samstha (Galduva Sect) of Ramanna Nikaya. In addition to that Vaturuvila Vanavasa sect of Siam Nikaya and several monasteries of all the three Nikayas continue to have forest monasteries.\n\n[3] Sri Lankan Forest Tradition: Matara Nanarama Maha Thera who is considered to be the father of the Sri Lankan modern forest meditation tradition had developed a new meditation system which is balanced in both Vipassana and Samatha by researching through old Sri Lankan meditation methods and by learning Burmese Mahasi Vipassana Method. Some of his best student monks are listed below.A student of late venerable Kadavedduve Jinavamsa Maha Thera who was the founder of the Sri Kalyani Yogashrama Samstha as well as Sayadaw U Acinna who was the founder of Pa Awk Tawya Monastery. He had an exceptional Mindfulness (Sati-memory and awareness) and control in the physical actions (Kaya Samvara) and day-to-day activities. It is said that he was a Bhodhisatva who was hoping to reach the Buddhahood in a future life.\n\n[4] Sri Lankan Forest Tradition: When other Theravada countries such as Siam (Thailand) and Ramanna (Part of Burma/Myanmar) lost their monks' lineage, Sri Lankan monks were sent to re-establish the Upasampada monks' lineage there during the period of Polonnaru Kingdom in Sri Lanka. Later in the 17th century BC, the Upasampada Lineage is disappeared in Sri Lanka due to the attacks and domination of Western intruders. The novice monk Weliwita Saranamkara was able to re-establish Upasampada in Sri Lanka which was brought from Siam (Thailand). During the 18th century Several monks were able to bring new Upasampada lineages again from Amarapura (a part of Burma/Myanmar) and Ramanna (a part of Burma/Myanmar).\n\n[5] Sri Lankan Forest Tradition: A group of three wall kutis in the Laggala forest close to knuckles mountains in the north Central province. Independent solitary meditation practice is done by monks with daily alms round and fortnightly Patimokkha chanting. The famous ascetic monk Danish Nanadipa lived in the cottages of the Laggala forest for several decades. American Bhikkhu Kovida was another famous character in 1980s at Laggala.\n\n[6] Sri Lankan Forest Tradition: Since the day of first establishment of Buddhist Lineage in Sri Lanka, it was managed to secure the Theravada tradition as the main Buddhist tradition until now. After the era of the great Indian emperor Asoka, Sri Lanka was the center of Theravada tradition in the world. The Pali Cannon (Theravada Tipitaka) which was continued by memorizing was first written in Sri Lanka at the Aluvihara in Matale. Almost all the early commentaries of Dhamma (Attha Katha) were written in Sri Lanka. The popular commentary writer Bhiikku Buddhaghosa was able to translate Sri Lankan commentaries which had been written in Sinhala Language, in to Pali Language during the Anuradhapura era.\n\n[7] Sri Kalyani Yogasrama Samstha: Śrī Kalyāṇī Yogāśrama Saṃsthā (, ), also known as the Galduwa Forest Tradition is an independent part of the Sri Lankan Ramañña Nikāya Buddhist ordination line, with their headquarters in Galduva, Kahawa - Ambalangoda. They are keeping a strict standard of Vinaya (commentarial interpretation), recognised as the strictest standard of any major organisation in Sri Lanka. It is the largest forest sect of the Sri Lankan Sangha (Buddhist Monks). Their monks are easily recognised by the palm-leaf umbrella they are using and by the habit of wearing the Sanghati (double robe) whenever they walk outside the monastery boundaries. Remarkably for Sri Lanka, all castes are accepted for ordination. Foreign monks, who wish to become resident at one of their monasteries, are usually expected to undergo the so-called \"Dalhi-Kamma\" at Galduva, a short ceremony meant to reconfirm the validity of their original Upasampada according to Galduva standard. After that they are accepted according to their normal seniority.\n\n[8] Theravada: Today there are forest based traditions in most Theravada countries, including the Sri Lankan Forest Tradition, the Thai Forest Tradition as well as lesser known forest based traditions in Burma and Laos, such as the Burmese forest based monasteries (\"taw\"yar\") of Pa Auk Sayadaw. In Thailand, forest monks are known as \"phra thudong\" (ascetic wandering monks) or \"phra thudong kammathan\" (wandering ascetic meditator).\n\n[9] Ramanna Nikaya: Most of the well known 'Forest Meditation Masters' and 'Forest Meditation Centers' are said to be in Ramanna Nikaya. Most ven. Matara Sri Gnanarama maha thera who lived in Mitirigala Nissarana Vanaya was the 'Father of the Sri Lankan Forest Meditation Tradition'. Most ven. Katukurunde Nyanananda Mahathera, Most ven. Udairiyagama Dhammajiva Mahathera and Most ven. Nauyane Ariyadhamma Mahathera were the great meditation masters of Ramanna Nikaya Forest Tradition.\n\n[10] Monastery: Forest monasteries – most commonly found in the Theravada traditions of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka – are monasteries dedicated primarily to the study of Buddhist meditation, rather than scholarship or ceremonial duties. Forest monasteries often function like early Christian monasteries, with small groups of monks living an essentially hermit-like life gathered loosely around a respected elder teacher. While the wandering lifestyle practised by the Buddha and his disciples continues to be the ideal model for forest tradition monks in Thailand and elsewhere, practical concerns- including shrinking wilderness areas, lack of access to lay supporters, dangerous wildlife, and dangerous border conflicts- dictate that increasing numbers of \"meditation\" monks live in monasteries, rather than wandering.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The couple wanders solemnly through the outback with some other Aborigines, when the young woman finds a pair of mystical red pumps on a desert mountain and instantly learns to dance. Bowie's calling 'put on your red shoes' recalls Hans Christian Andersen's tale \"The Red Shoes\", in which the little girl was vainly tempted to wear the shoes only to find they could not be removed, separating her from God's grace - \"let's dance for fear your grace should fall\" \"The red shoes are a found symbol. They are the simplicity of the capitalist society and sort of striving for success - black music is all about 'Put on your red shoes'\", as Bowie confirmed.\n\n[2] Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul: The love song \"I've Been Loving You Too Long\" was co-written by Redding and The Impressions' lead singer Jerry Butler in a hotel near the Atlanta airport. Redding's rendition of Cooke's \"Shake\" is again more funky. The song is about the club dancing in the so-called discothèques, which debuted in the early 1960s. The song was described as \"a hard-swinging, full-throated 2:40 of precision ferocity with a force that would flat-out explode during his live sets.\" The last five songs are all covers by popular artists: The Temptations' \"My Girl\", written by Smokey Robinson and Ronald White; Cooke's \"Wonderful World\"; B.B. King's \"Rock Me Baby\"; The Rolling Stones' \"Satisfaction\", on which Redding sings \"fashion\" instead of \"faction\"; and William Bell's \"You Don't Miss Your Water\", which was characterized as \"sorrowful country blues\", and has \"one of the most devastating pleading-man lead vocals in the entire Stax catalog.\" \"Satisfaction\" sounded so plausible that a journalist even accused the Stones of stealing the song from Redding, and that they performed it after Redding. Music writer Robert Christgau describes it as an \"anarchic reading\" of the Stones' original.\n\n[3] All Around My Hat (song): The song \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" appears in John Ford's film of the same name. In the 'Watching TV' episode of British television sitcom \"Men Behaving Badly\", Gary and Dorothy repeatedly end up singing the Steeleye Span version of the song while trying to remember the theme tune to \"Starsky and Hutch\". Paul Whitehouse also sings the first lines of the song in an episode of \"The Fast Show\", changing a key word in each line with \"arse\".\n\n[4] The Red Shoes (song): \"The Red Shoes\" was released in April 1994 and made it to number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. The song is about a girl who puts on a pair of enchanted ballet slippers and can't stop dancing until she breaks the spell. It is inspired by a character in the Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger film \"The Red Shoes\".\n\n[5] Red Dress (song): The Sugababes performed \"Red Dress\" in Turin, Italy, in February 2006 for \"Top of the Pops\" at the Winter Olympics. To promote the song's release, they performed it on 6 March 2006 at the HMV store on Oxford Street, London. The single appeared in the set list for the group's \"Taller in More Ways\" tour in 2006, and served as the shows' encore in conjunction with \"Push the Button\". According to Craig Hope of \"Chronicle Live\", the song \"came amid a sea of manic applause\". \"Red Dress\" was featured in the set list for their 2007 tour in support of \"Overloaded: The Singles Collection\". The Sugababes performed the single at the Aintree Pavilion in July 2007 as part of the Liverpool Summer Pops music event. It was the opening song of the gig, and the trio was backed by a five-piece band. The single was performed on 14 September 2007 during their gig at indig02, a live club for smaller music events. Nick Levine of Digital Spy described the performance as \"one of the night's pulsating highlights\".\n\n[6] Blue Suede Shoes: That night Perkins began working on a song based on the incident. His first thought was to frame it with a nursery rhyme. He considered, and quickly discarded \"Little Jack Horner... \" and \"See a spider going up the wall...\", then settled on \"One for the money...\" Leaving his bed and working with his Les Paul guitar, he started with an A chord. After playing five chords while singing \"Well, it's one for the money... Two for the show... Three to get ready... Now go, man, go!\" he broke into a boogie rhythm. He quickly grabbed a brown paper potato sack and wrote the song down, writing the title out as \"Blue Swade\"; \"S-W-A-D-E – I couldn't even spell it right\", he later said. According to Perkins, \"On December 17, 1955, I wrote 'Blue Suede Shoes'. I recorded it on December 19\", for Sun Records, which released the second take of the song. Sun's producer, Sam Phillips, suggested that the lyric \"go cat go\" be changed to \"go man go\", but the suggestion was not taken.\n\n[7] Red Skies: \"Red Skies\" peaked at number 13 on the U.S. Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, number 44 in the Netherlands and number 57 in the UK. Winda Benedetti of \"The Spokesman-Review\" said it was one \"of the more cutting-edge pop [songs] of the time.\" Mark Spinn of \"The Orange County Register\" called it \"the best of the band's moodier material.\" Bill Locey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" complimented the song's \"memorable chorus\". The Fixx performed the song on \"Saturday Night Live\" on February 18, 1984.\n\n[8] David Rose (songwriter): \"The Stripper\" was composed by Rose in 1958 for a television special saluting burlesque. The song featured especially prominent trombone lines, giving the tune its lascivious signature, and evokes the feel of music used to accompany burlesque striptease artists. Four years later, MGM Records wanted to rush-release Rose's recording of \"Ebb Tide\" as a 45-rpm single, but needed a B-side. An office boy went through some of Rose's tapes searching for one, and \"The Stripper\" was chosen. It became a surprise hit, receiving much radio play and becoming a popular party record. The piece features in the films \"Slap Shot\", \"The Full Monty\" and \"\" as well as TV series \"Little Britain\" and \"Scrubs\". It was also famously used in a parody by British comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, where they danced to the tune while making breakfast.\n\n[9] The Red Strokes: The video opens with an all-white room. As the song starts, Brooks is shown rising out of the floor from a red puddle like it was water in an all-white suit and barefoot sitting at a white piano. As the music builds up, the different colors of paint represented (red, blue, and green) are splashed across him and the piano. During the guitar solo, another Brooks is standing over the first Brooks on the piano wearing a black and red outfit. At the end of the song, Brooks goes back to an all white scene, singing \"Steam on a window, salt in a kiss/Two hearts have never pounded like this\", with the fade out done as red paint (digitally inserted) runs down the screen.\n\n[10] Lucille Bogan: Her final recordings with Roland and Josh White include two takes of \"Shave 'Em Dry\", recorded in New York on Tuesday, March 5, 1935. The unexpurgated alternate take is notorious for its explicit sexual references, a unique record of the lyrics sung in after-hours adult clubs. According to Keith Briggs' liner notes for Document Records Complete Recordings, these were recorded either for the fun of the recording engineers, or for \"clandestine distribution as a 'Party Record.'\" Briggs notes that Bogan seems to be unfamiliar with the lyrics, reading them as she sings them, potentially surprised by them herself. Another of her songs, \"B.D. Woman's Blues\", takes the position of a \"bull dyke\" (\"B.D.\"), with the lyrics \"Comin' a time, B.D. women, they ain't gonna need no men\", \"They got a head like a sweet angel and they walk just like a natural man\" and \"They can lay their jive just like a natural man\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Van Buuren wrote the instrumental with de Goeij and Ewbank in 2012. Trevor Guthrie wrote the lyrics with Jenson Vaughan, and it was inspired by Guthrie's neighbor who was diagnosed with a brain tumor. \"This Is What It Feels Like\" was nominated for the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.\n\n[2] This Is What It Feels Like: \"This Is What It Feels Like\" is a song by Dutch DJ and record producer Armin van Buuren. It features vocals from Canadian singer and songwriter Trevor Guthrie. The song was released in the Netherlands by Armada Music as a digital download on 29 April 2013 as the second single from van Buuren's fifth studio album \"Intense\". It became a top 10 hit in ten countries. In the Netherlands, the song peaked at number 3 on the Dutch Top 40. \"This Is What It Feels Like\" became van Buuren's first top 10 hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 6 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n[3] Lisa Loeb: In November 2016, Loeb released her fourth children's album entitled \"Feel What You Feel.\" She wrote and composed the selections on this album based on \"what I'd like to pass along to my kids and kids in general.\" The title track, \"Feel What U Feel,\" featured Craig Robinson of \"The Office,\" and it became the #1 song on SiriusXM's \"Kids Place Live,\" on which program it continued to be played as of the last days of August 2017. The parenting site, \"CoolMomPicks\".com, chose \"Feel What U Feel\" as a 2016 Pick of the Year. On January 28, 2018, Loeb won a Grammy Award for her work on the album.\n\n[4] What It Feels Like for a Girl: In April 2000, it was announced that French musician Mirwais Ahmadzaï was creating a melding of dance and pop songs with a disco feel for the album. Later, it was also announced that she enlisted Guy Sigsworth to work with her on the album. The singer had followed Sigsworth's work, admired his love of understated technology in music, and contacted him for adding an ambient feel to her record. Madonna played him the rough demo tracks developed for \"Music\", including the songs created with Ahmadzaï. The idea for \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" came to Madonna when she was halfway through her pregnancy and was trying to keep the media from finding out. Sigsworth sent her a demo backing track containing a sample from the 1993 British film, \"The Cement Garden\", directed by Andrew Birkin, in which the voice of actress Charlotte Gainsbourg speaks softly, \"Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots. 'Cause it's OK to be a boy. But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading. 'Cause \"you\" think that \"being\" a girl is degrading. But secretly you'd love to know what it's like... Wouldn't you? What it feels like for a girl\".\n\n[5] What It Feels Like for a Girl: As the pre-chorus ends, the drums are pulled out and added immediately the chorus starts, washed over by tidal keys and pads, and Madonna asking the question, \"Do you know what it feels like for a girl?\". Phil Dellio from \"The Village Voice\" noticed the presence of \"gossamer-like\" synthesizer in the background, while author Rikky Rooksby highlighted the equalized bass guitar in the center of the production. Another characteristic Sigsworth feature is the sound of a CD player \"skipping\" during the song. A Spanish version of the track, titled \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\" (English: \"What a Woman Feels\"), was translated by Alberto Ferreras and included on the bonus disc of the 2001 Special Tour edition of \"Music\" and as a bonus track on the Mexican and Latin American editions. Stan Hawkins, author of \"Critical Musicological Reflections\", felt that by switching \"girl\" to \"woman\" in the Spanish version, Madonna had \"upgraded\" its nature. Lyrically, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" condemns male chauvinism by addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority and female role-playing in society, with the singer inviting men to imagine themselves as girls.\n\n[6] What It Feels Like for a Girl: The song received acclaim from most music critics, who declared it as a highlight from the album, while also remarking it as one of the most mature musical ventures of Madonna's career. Commercially, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" reached the top-ten of the record charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Romania, Spain, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number-one on the Dance Club Songs chart.\n\n[7] Feels Like Today (song): \"Feels Like Today\" is a song written by Wayne Hector and Steve Robson and recorded by American country music group Rascal Flatts. It was released in June 2004 as the first single and title track from the album \"Feels Like Today\". The song peaked at number 9 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in 2004.\n\n[8] This Is What It Feels Like: \"This Is What It Feels Like\" was covered by Canadian country music artist Jason Benoit and released through Sky Hit Records, under license to Sony Music Canada, as Benoit's debut single on 10 September 2013. His rendition reached number 46 on the \"Billboard\" Canada Country chart. It received positive reviews for Benoit's \"strong vocal performance\" was also included on the compilation album, \"Country Heat 2014\".\n\n[9] What It Feels Like for a Girl: In 2010, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was featured in an episode of American television series \"Glee\", called \"The Power of Madonna\". In the episode it was performed by actors Cory Monteith, Kevin McHale, Chris Colfer, Mark Salling, Harry Shum Jr. and Matthew Morrison. The song was released as digital download to the iTunes Store, and was also included on the soundtrack EP, \"\". It charted at number 125 on the UK Singles Chart. In his review of the soundtrack, Fraser McAlpine from BBC News felt that \"the decision to get all the boys to sing 'What It Feels Like for a Girl' is inspired, and represents a genuinely powerful musical moment that doesn't need the television show's plot to make it fly\".Credits adapted from liner notes of 12-inch single.\n\n[10] Feels (song): \"Feels\" is a song recorded and produced by Scottish DJ Calvin Harris. It features vocals from American singer-songwriters Pharrell Williams and Katy Perry as well as American rapper Big Sean. It was released on 15 June 2017 through Sony Music as the fourth single from his fifth studio album \"Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1\" (2017), after \"Slide\", \"Heatstroke\" and \"Rollin\".

It is the C3 sulfamate ester of ethinylestradiol. The drug shows considerably improved oral estrogenic potency (uterotrophic) relative to ethinylestradiol in rats but without an increase in hepatic estrogenic potency. Related compounds like ethinylestradiol \"N\",\"N\"-diethylsulfamate (J271) and ethinylestradiol pyrrolidinosulfonate (J272) have also been developed, and have similar properties in animals. However, the closely related compound estradiol sulfamate (E2MATE) failed to show estrogenic activity in humans, which is due to the fact that it is additionally a highly potent inhibitor of steroid sulfatase and prevents its own bioactivation into estradiol.\n\n[2] JWH-251: JWH-251 (1-pentyl-3-(2-methylphenylacetyl)indole) is a synthetic cannabinoid from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist with about 5x selectivity for CB with a K of 29nM and 146nM at CB. Similar to the related 2'-methoxy compound JWH-250, the 2'-chloro compound JWH-203, and the 2'-bromo compound JWH-249, JWH-251 has a phenylacetyl group in place of the naphthoyl ring used in most aminoalkylindole cannabinoid compounds.\n\n[3] JWH-249: JWH-249 (1-pentyl-3-(2-bromophenylacetyl)indole) is a synthetic cannabinoid from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist with about 2.4x selectivity for CB with a K of 8.4nM ± 1.8 and 20nM ± 2 at CB. Similar to the related 2'-methoxy compound JWH-250, the 2'-chloro compound JWH-203, and the 2'-methyl compound JWH-251, JWH-249 has a phenylacetyl group in place of the naphthoyl ring used in most aminoalkylindole cannabinoid compounds.\n\n[4] JWH-007: JWH-007 is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB and CB receptors. It was the most active of the first group of N-alkyl naphoylindoles discovered by the team led by John W Huffman, several years after the family was initially described with the discovery of the N-morpholinylethyl compounds pravadoline (WIN 48,098), WIN 55,225 (JWH-200) and WIN 55,212-2 by the Sterling Winthrop group. Several other N-alkyl substituents were found to be active by Huffman's team including the \"n\"-butyl, \"n\"-hexyl, 2-heptyl and cyclohexylethyl groups, but it was subsequently determined that the 2-methyl group on the indole ring is not required for CB binding, and tends to increase affinity for CB instead. Consequently, the 2-desmethyl derivative of JWH-007, JWH-018 has slightly higher binding affinity for CB, with an optimum binding of 9.00nM at CB and 2.94nM at CB, and JWH-007 displayed optimum binding of 9.50nM at CB and 2.94nM at CB.\n\n[5] JWH-250: JWH-250 or (1-pentyl-3-(2-methoxyphenylacetyl)indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family that acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB and CB receptors, with a \"K\" of 11 nM at CB and 33 nM at CB. Unlike many of the older JWH series compounds, this compound does not have a naphthalene ring, instead occupying this position with a 2'-methoxy-phenylacetyl group, making JWH-250 a representative member of a new class of cannabinoid ligands. Other 2'-substituted analogues such as the methyl, chloro and bromo compounds are also active and somewhat more potent.\n\n[6] JWH-167: JWH-167 (1-pentyl-3-(phenylacetyl)indole) is a synthetic cannabinoid from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist with about 1.75x selectivity for CB with a K of 90nM ± 17 and 159nM ± 14 at CB. Similar to the related 2'-methoxy compound JWH-250, and the 2'-chloro compound JWH-203, JWH-167 has a phenylacetyl group in place of the naphthoyl ring used in most aminoalkylindole cannabinoid compounds.\n\n[7] JP-8: JP-8+100 (F-37) is a version of JP-8 with an additive that increases its thermal stability by 100 °F (a difference of 56 °C). The additive is a combination of a surfactant, metal deactivator, and an antioxidant, and was introduced in 1994 to reduce choking and fouling in engine fuel systems. The additive is known as 8Q462, or Aeroshell Performance Additive 101, is manufactured by BetzDearborn (Now GE Betz), and used at the ratio of 256 ppm, at cost of about $1 per 1000 gallons of fuel. Commercially, this additive is used in police helicopters in Tampa, Florida. JP-8+100 is also used for Canadian Forces CH-124 Sea King, CP-140 Aurora, CC-130 Hercules and the CC-115 Buffalo.\n\n[8] JWH-203: JWH-203 (1-pentyl-3-(2-chlorophenylacetyl)indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family that acts as a cannabinoid agonist with approximately equal affinity at both the CB and CB receptors, having a K of 8.0nM at CB and 7.0nM at CB. It was originally discovered by, and named after, Dr. John W. Huffman, but has subsequently been sold without his permission as an ingredient of synthetic cannabis smoking blends. Similar to the related 2'-methoxy compound JWH-250, the 2'-bromo compound JWH-249, and the 2'-methyl compound JWH-251, JWH-203 has a phenylacetyl group in place of the naphthoyl ring used in most aminoalkylindole cannabinoid compounds, and has the strongest \"in vitro\" binding affinity for the cannabinoid receptors of any compound in the phenylacetyl group.\n\n[9] JWH-210: JWH-210 is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a potent cannabinoid agonist at both the CB and CB receptors, with K values of 0.46nM at CB and 0.69nM at CB. It is one of the most potent 4-substituted naphthoyl derivatives in the naphthoylindole series, having a higher binding affinity (i.e. lower K) at CB than both its 4-methyl and 4-\"n\"-propyl homologues JWH-122 (CB K 0.69nM) and JWH-182 (CB K 0.65nM) respectively, and than the 4-methoxy compound JWH-081 (CB K 1.2nM). It was discovered by and named after Dr. John W. Huffman.\n\n[10] JWH-302: JWH-302 or (1-pentyl-3-(3-methoxyphenylacetyl)indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist with moderate affinity at both the CB and CB receptors. It is a positional isomer of the more common drug JWH-250, though it is slightly less potent with a \"K\" of 17 nM at CB, compared to 11 nM for JWH-250. Because of their identical molecular weight and similar fragmentation patterns, JWH-302 and JWH-250 can be very difficult to distinguish by GC-MS testing.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

What distinguishes \"Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams\" from other games of a similar ilk is its bright colourful graphics and its lead character, Cotton. The game also takes place in a fantasy dream-like world instead of space like many other shooting games. The game can be compared to other fantasy Shoot 'em up games like \"Parodius\". It bears most similarities in style to the \"Chariot\" game on \"Three Wonders\".\n\n[2] Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams: Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams (コットン FANTASTIC NIGHT DREAMS) is a scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Success and published by Sega on Sega's Sega System 16B Arcade system board in 1991 as is the first entry in the \"Cotton\" series. It was ported to both the Sharp X68000 and the NEC TurboGrafx-CD (also known as PC Engine) in 1993. The TurboGrafx-CD version was released on Super CD-ROM and features an enhanced redbook audio soundtrack and voice acting on the Japanese release. The game was later ported to the PlayStation under the title SuperLite 1500 Series - Fantastic Night Dreams - Cotton Original in 1999. A downgraded version was released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000.\n\n[3] Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams: The player controls Cotton, a young witch on a broomstick. The player must blast various monsters and avoid being shot. The player can collect power-ups to enhance their weaponry and unleash a more powerful attack on the enemy. The player has lives represented by an arrow. The player has three lives and is only allowed one hit per life.\n\n[4] Cotton (series): The Cotton Original tea cup was made to commemorate the release of Cotton Original on the PlayStation. It is white with no handle and has a blue drawing of Cotton and Silk on the front, with the words \"Fantastic Night Dreams Cotton Original\" in the top left corner. The origin of these cups and the quantity made are currently unknown.\n\n[5] Cotton (series): Each Cotton game features a unique story that is loosely connected to the other games in the series. All of these stories revolve around the obsession of a young German witch named Cotton with a magical type of candy called \"Willow\". In a typical Cotton game, Cotton will embark on her journey through the game's stages with the hope that she will be rewarded with a Willow at the end. However, when the game is over, she almost always winds up empty-handed.\n\n[6] Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams: A port of the game was released in America and Japan for the TurboGrafx-CD. The PlayStation release combines the enhanced digital CD-ROM soundtrack of TurboGrafx-CD release and the gameplay/graphics of the original arcade version.\n\n[7] Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams: Famitsu gave Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams' PCE version 29/40 and PS version 21/40.\n\n[8] Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams: The game had a Japan and Europe only release for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Due to hardware limitations the Neo Geo Pocket Color features less detailed graphics and sound compared to previous versions, however it is still a faithful version of the original in terms of gameplay.\n\n[9] Cotton (series): The series is a line of shoot 'em up video game software developed by Success with a long history of releases both in arcades and on home video game consoles. With the series debuting in 1991, the Cotton games have helped to establish the visual style of shoot 'em ups sometimes called \"cute 'em up\". Instead of warships and battlefields typical of most shoot 'em ups, Cotton games put players in control of a witch riding on a broom and tasks them with fighting through magical haunted kingdoms. Cotton games have appeared on a variety of consoles including the PC Engine, the Super Famicom, the Mega Drive, the Sega Saturn, the PlayStation, the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Dreamcast. There is also a pachinko game featuring Cotton available for the PlayStation 2. Cotton appears as a hidden character in the Nintendo DS game \"Rondo of Swords\".\n\n[10] Cotton (series): Famitsu gave Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams' PCE version 29/40 and PS version 21/40.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Verlinden was introduced to the sport at an early age and came to prominence in 2008 when he won the WKA European Super Cruiserweight Muay Thai Championship, followed by the WKA World Cruiserweight title the following year. He then took the gold medal at the 2010 IFMA World Championships in the +91 kg/200 lb division as an amateur before a short stint in the It's Showtime promotion where he unsuccessfully challenged Danyo Ilunga for the It's Showtime 95MAX Championship in June 2012. Later that year, he joined Glory.\n\n[2] W.A.K.O. World Championships 2001 (Maribor): As with Light-Contact the men had nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. Notable winners included Marco Culiersi, Samantha Aquilano and Luisa Lico who had all won gold medals at the last world championships in Caorle. Also of note were Elaine Fowler and Nadja Sibila who would become double winners at the same event having also picked up winning medals in their relevant Light-Contact divisions. By the end of the championships Italy were the strongest country in the style by some way, winning six gold medals, two silver and four bronze.\n\n[3] W.A.K.O. World Championships 2001 (Maribor): Both men and women participated in the style with the men having nine weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/+206.8 lbs while the women had six ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. Notable winners included Fouad Habbani, who would go on to make a successful transition to Full-Contact winning gold in Belgrade a few months later, Wojciech Szczerbiński who had won gold at the last world championships in Caorle, and Elaine Fowler and Nadja Sibila who would be double winners as they would win gold medals in Semi-Contact as well. By the end of the championships Hungary were the strongest in Light-Contact winning three golds, two silvers and four bronze.\n\n[4] Juan Medina Herrad: Medina competed at the 2010 Youth World Amateur Boxing Championships, being defeated by Indian boxer Devendro Laishram 17–8 in his first fight. He also boxed in the 2010 World Combat Games in Beijing, China, where he won the bronze medal after losing to Zou Shiming of China. He represented La Romana at the 2010 Romana Cup, winning the gold medal in the 49 kg light flyweight category by defeating Luis Díaz of the Dominican Republic National Team. Medina boxed at Pan American Games Qualifier 1 in Cumaná, Venezuela, winning the gold medal and thus qualifying for the Pan American Games. At the games he lost to Joselito Velázquez in the semifinal to finish with the bronze medal in the light flyweight category. In July 2011, Medina boxed at the 5th CISM Military World Games and was defeated by Indian Nanao Singh 20–18 in the preliminary round of the 49 kg category. At the Romana Cup, held in his hometown La Romana, he won the gold medal in the 46–49 kg category and was nominated Most Technical Boxer in the event. In the 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships he lost 17–6 to Zou Shiming in the first round.\n\n[5] Luiz Altamir Melo: At the 2018 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Hangzhou, China, Luiz Altamir Melo, along with Fernando Scheffer, Leonardo Coelho Santos and Breno Correia, surprised the world by winning the gold medal in the Men's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay, breaking the world record, with a time of 6:46.81. The relay was composed only by young people between 19 and 23 years, and was not favorite to gold. He also finished 6th in the Men's 200 metre butterfly and 8th in the Men's 200 metre freestyle.\n\n[6] Ivan Chakarov: Ivan Chakarov (), also known as \"James Dean\" of weightlifting, born 1966, is a Bulgarian world class weightlifter who won gold medals in the 91 kg class at the 1993 World Weightlifting Championships in Melbourne, Australia and in the 90 kg class at the 1991 European Weightlifting Championships in Władysławowo, Poland. Chakarov was exceptional in the Back Squat, and squatted 270 kg (595.25 lbs) for 3 deep repetitions at the 1993 World Weightlifting Championships. This feat became well known as the \"No-No-No\" squat, as Chakarov did not use a lifting belt, knee wraps, or spotters for this attempt.\n\n[7] Weightlifting at the 1972 Summer Olympics – Men's 56 kg: The favorites in the event were the same lifters that made up the first four places at the 1968 Summer Olympics. The snatch was won by Koji Miki of Japan with a lift of 112.5 kg. But in an out-of-competition attempt to break the world record, he improved his own mark from 113.5 kg to 114.0 kg. The lifter placing 12th, Soviet-born Israeli Ze'ev Friedman, would become one of the victims of the kidnapping by the Palestinian Black September group. Friedman was killed in the firefight at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base.\n\n[8] Selma Yağcı: She won a bronze medal in the light heavyweight (90 kg) division at the 1st World Women's Boxing Championship held between October 21 and 27, 2001 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, United States before she fought a silver medal in the cruiserweight (80 kg) division at the 3rd World Women's Boxing Championship held between September 25 and October 2, 2005 in Podolsk, Russia. At the 5th AIBA Women's World Boxing Championship held between November 22 and 29, 2008 in Ningbo City, China, Selma Yağcı became a bronze medalist in her division (80 kg).\n\n[9] 2000 CARIFTA Games: In the boys' U-20 category, Dwayne Henclewood from Jamaica threw the discus 50.41m. In the girls' U-20 category, Veronica Campbell from Jamaica finished the 200 metres in 23.05 seconds. Sheree Francis from Jamaica equalled the 1.79 m jumped by Nicola Springer, Barbados, in high jump in the year 1987. Claudia Villeneuve from Martinique set new records in shot put (15.29m) and discus throw (50.14m). And Keitha Moseley from Barbados achieved 3,695 points in heptathlon. Moreover, Adrianna Lamalle from Martinique reached 13.64s in the 100 metres hurdles event.\n\n[10] 2007 CARIFTA Games: In the boys' U-17 category, Dexter Lee of Jamaica set two new games records, both in 100 metres (10.34s), and in 200 metres (21.09s). His compatriot Kemoy Campbell also set two new games records in 1500 metres (4:00.04), and 3000 metres (8:46.49). And as in the U-20 category, the records fell in high jump and shot put: Raymond Higgs from the Bahamas jumped 2.13m, whereas Quincy Wilson from Trinidad and Tobago reached 16.27m.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is usually used to support the infantry by indirect fire, but it can also be used for direct fire. Each Finnish infantry company has a platoon of 81 mm mortars. The mortar platoon consists of three seven-man mortar squads, each squad manning a single 81 mm mortar. Jaeger Company M2005 has a fire support squad, which consists of two five-man mortar teams, both equipped with an 81 mm mortar. It can fire HE-fragmentation, smoke, illumination and practice rounds.\n\n[2] 81 KRH 71 Y: Tampella also manufactured a static installed 81 KRH 71 RT (\"81 mm kranaatinheitin malli 1971 rannikkotykistö\", '81 mm mortar model 1971, coastal artillery') for use in the Finnish coastal artillery fortresses.\n\n[3] 81 KRH 71 Y: A newer version of the 81 KRH 71 Y with an improved baseplate made by Vammas is called the 81 KRH 96 (\"81 mm kranaatinheitin malli 1996\", '81 mm mortar model 1996'). The baseplate is designed by scaling down the baseplate of the 120 KRH 92.\n\n[4] Type 81 (rocket launcher): The Type 81 is a self-propelled 122 mm multiple rocket launcher (SPMRL) produced by the People's Republic of China for the People's Liberation Army Ground Force. It is a variant of the Soviet BM-21 Grad. The Type 81 was the first in a family of Chinese self-propelled 122 mm rocket launchers.\n\n[5] New York State Route 81: New York State Route 81 (NY 81) is an east–west state highway in the Capital District of New York in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 145 in the hamlet of Cooksburg within the town of Rensselaerville. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) in the town of Coxsackie. East of US 9W, the right-of-way of NY 81 continues southeast to the village of Coxsackie as NY 385. NY 81 intersects NY 32 north of the hamlet of Cairo.\n\n[6] EMG 81: The EMG 81 is a popular active humbucker guitar pickup manufactured by EMG, Inc.. It is usually considered a lead pickup for use in the bridge position, paired with EMG's 85 as a rhythm pickup in neck position (Zakk Wylde is famous for this configuration). It's not uncommon, however, to see a guitar with two EMG 81s in both bridge and neck positions (for instance, Kirk Hammett's EMG-KH21 pickup sets, which include 2 EMG 81 pickups for both neck and bridge positions).\n\n[7] New Jersey Route 81: Route 81 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The route is a freeway connector between exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and U.S. Route 1/9 near Newark Liberty International Airport. It runs for 1.18 miles (1.90 km), entirely within the city of Elizabeth in Union County. A freeway called Route S100 was initially proposed on the current alignment of Route 81 in 1938; it, along with its parent Route 100, was never built. The current route was conceived in the 1960s as a freeway replacement for Route 164, which followed Humboldt Avenue, a surface road. It was to be designated Route 76, but was renumbered to Route 81 when Interstate 76 was created in New Jersey.\n\n[8] Lotus 81: The Lotus 81 was a Formula One racing car built by Colin Chapman's Lotus team for the 1980 Formula One season. Unlike many of its illustrious Lotus forebears the 81 was not a terribly innovative or competitive car, coming as it did at a time when Chapman's interest in his racing activities was waning.\n\n[9] Ohio State Route 81: State Route 81 (SR 81) is an east–west route in western Ohio. Its western terminus is at the Indiana state line near Willshire (the route continues as State Road 124), and its eastern terminus is at SR 53 in Patterson. The route also goes through or close to the towns of Elgin, Lima, Ada, and Dunkirk.\n\n[10] Super soft X-ray source: RE J0317-853 is the hottest magnetic WD at 49,250 K, with an exceptionally intense magnetic field of ~340 MG, and implied rotation period of 725.4 s.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich reddish-brown colour gets its name from a pigment extracted from cuttlefish?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Cuttlefish: The \"cuttle\" in cuttlefish comes from the Old English name for the species, \"cudele\", which may be cognate with the Old Norse \"koddi\" (cushion) and the Middle Low German \"Kudel\" (rag). The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The word for it in both Greek and Latin, \"sepia\", now refers to the reddish-brown color sepia in English.\n\n[2] Sepia (color): Sepia is a reddish-brown color, named after the rich brown pigment derived from the ink sac of the common cuttlefish \"Sepia\".\n\n[3] Pharaoh cuttlefish: Pharaoh cuttlefish often show a solid color when resting on a solid color background, alternating from a pale white to all dark brown. Additionally, they can show a mottled white and brown color, with a center circle of brown. The mechanism for color is the same in the Pharaoh cuttlefish as it is in other cuttlefish. This colour-changing function is produced by groups of red, yellow, brown, and black pigmented chromatophores above a layer of reflective blue and green tinted iridophores and leucophores, with up to 200 of these specialized pigment cells per square millimeter. These sacs of color are controlled by rings of muscle around the sac. The cuttlefish expands and contracts these muscle rings in order to show different colors.\n\n[4] Goldfish: If left in the dark for a period of time, goldfish gradually change colour until they are almost gray. Goldfish produce pigment in response to light, in a similar manner to how human skin becomes tanned in the sun. Fish have cells called chromatophores that produce pigments which reflect light, and give the fish colouration. The colour of a goldfish is determined by which pigments are in the cells, how many pigment molecules there are, and whether the pigment is grouped inside the cell or is spaced throughout the cytoplasm.\n\n[5] Tekhelet: Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog (1889–1959) obtained a sample of this dye and had it chemically analyzed. The chemists concluded that it was a well-known synthetic dye \"Prussian blue\" made by reacting Iron(II) sulfate with an organic material. In this case, the cuttlefish only supplied the organic material which could have as easily been supplied from a vast array of organic sources (e. g., ox blood). R. Herzog thus rejected the cuttlefish as the \"Ḥillazon\" and some suggest that had the Grand Rabbi Gershon Henoch Leiner known this fact, he too would have rejected it based on his explicit criterion that the blue color must come from the animal and that all other additives are permitted solely to aid the color in adhering to the wool.\n\n[6] Warty frogfish: Frogfishes have the capacity to change coloration and pigment pattern in a few weeks : during coral bleaching events, they can even turn to plain white to blend in with the environment. However, the dominant coloration goes from white to black, passing through a whole range of related nuances such as cream, pink, yellow, red, and brown, often with dark, circular spots and/or with saddles. Some heavily spotted specimens can easily be confused with its close relative \"Antennarius pictus\". This characteristic can help to separate them: usually, \"A. maculatus\" has red or orange margins on all fins and sometimes a spike of the saddle blotch starts posterior to the eye.\n\n[7] Cuttlefish: The chromatophores are sacs containing hundreds of thousands of pigment granules and a large membrane that is folded when retracted. Hundreds of muscles radiate from the chromatophore. These are under neural control and when they expand, they reveal the hue of the pigment contained in the sac. Cuttlefish have three types of chromatophore: yellow/orange (the uppermost layer), red, and brown/black (the deepest layer). The cuttlefish can control the contraction and relaxation of the muscles around individual chromatophores, thereby opening or closing the elastic sacs and allowing different levels of pigment to be exposed. Furthermore, the chromatophores contain luminescent protein nanostructures in which tethered pigment granules modify light through absorbance, reflection, and fluorescence between 650 and 720 nm.\n\n[8] Synchiropus splendidus: \"S. splendidus\" is one of only two vertebrate species known to have blue colouring because of cellular pigment, the other being the closely related psychedelic mandarin (\"S. picturatus\"). The name \"cyanophore\" was proposed for the blue chromatophores, or pigment-containing and light-reflecting cells. In all other known cases, the colour blue is structural, as it comes from thin-film interference from piles of flat, thin and reflecting purine crystals. The mandarinfish has a body shape similar to a goby, though this is the only resemblance between the two. The vivid coloration sports a bright blue background, with swirly orange stripes and a blue-greenish face with bold blue stripes. The large pelvic fins are used for 'walking' on the seafloor and are often mistakenly seen as the pectoral fins. The real pectorals are located almost at the center and are nearly transparent, with a tinge of bright blue. Stripes continue onto the second dorsal fin, the anal fins and on part of the tail, the rest of which is striped in vibrant orange and blue. The dorsal fin, which is exceptionally tall in males, has a striking orange-and blue design as well. The eyes are usually red with black pupils. Different varieties sport different markings and colors. The green mandarin is the fish that has been described. The red mandarin is the same species, but its pelvic fins and what would be orange is red. In some rare cases, the entire dragonet is red with black stripes. The spotted mandarin is light gray-green with black, pink and blue spots.\n\n[9] Papilio protenor: There are two colour types exist in \"Papilio\" butterflies, green and brown. Pupae that grow on green coloured branches are always green, while those that live on dead branches are brown colour. Light condition does not seem to affect this relation. The green pigment is described as a \"insectoverdin\" type, which means it is a mixture of yellow and blue chromoproteins. The chemical compounds separated from the green pupae (e.g., beta-carotene and lutein) were not found in the brown pupae; however, the bile pigment from the blue chromoprotein was found in the brown pupae, but with a lower percentage than in the green ones.\n\n[10] Coral reef: The varying pigments in different species of zooxanthellae give them an overall brown or golden-brown appearance, and give brown corals their colors. Other pigments such as reds, blues, greens, etc. come from colored proteins made by the coral animals. Coral that loses a large fraction of its zooxanthellae becomes white (or sometimes pastel shades in corals that are pigmented with their own proteins) and is said to be bleached, a condition which, unless corrected, can kill the coral.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It branches from the Common Tunnel at Majorstuen and runs to Sognsvann. After Ullevål stadion, the Ring Line branches off. The Sognsvann Line serves the northwestern and northern neighborhoods of Oslo, mostly within the borough of Nordre Aker. The line is owned and maintained by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and has nine stations. The western end of line 5 serves the entire line. Line 4 and the eastern end of line 5 serve the southern part of the line up to Ullevål stadion before branching off and continuing along the Ring Line. This gives an average five-minute headway on the southern part and an average fifteen-minute headway on the northern part of the line.\n\n[2] Sognsvann Line: Frøen Station was rebuilt so only the trains on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while Nordberg Station was closed. All the stations, except Ullevål stadion, were built in the same architectural style. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed; Ullevål stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail from Majorstuen to Stortinget in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line. The new service became operated with T1000 rolling stock. Following the 1991 decision to build a new Rikshospitalet at Gaustad, it was decided to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway there, which would pass under the Sognsvann Line. Plans called for a transfer station at Blindern, but this was later discarded in favor of a new station, Forskningsparken. It would replace Vestgrensa, which was considered too far away to be a suitable transfer point. Forskningsparken would also serve the northern part of the Blindern campus. Not until 1998 were the necessary political agreements in place to allow construction to start. The new light rail started services on 1 June 1999, and the rapid transit station opened on 22 August. With the opening, Line 4 of the metro was extended from Blindern, via Forskningsparken, to Ullevål stadion. There were complaints from local residents that the increased traffic on the line was causing too much noise, and neighbors demanded that noise shields be built.\n\n[3] Sognsvann Line: The Sognsvann Line is served by lines 4 and 5 of the Oslo Metro. Half of line 5 trains operate the full length of the Sognsvann Line, while line 4 and the other half of the line 5 trains branch off after Ullevål stadion and serve the Ring Line. All services operate with a fifteen-minute headway, except during late evenings and weekend mornings. This gives the stations Blindern, Forskningsparken and Ullevål stadion an average five-minute headway to the city center and all stations in the Common Tunnel, and an average ten-minute headway to Nydalen and Storo. On the east side of the city, Line 5 connects with the Ring Line, and makes a full loop before it leaves Oslo on the Grorud Line. Line 4 connects with the Lambertseter Line. Travel time from Stortinget to Sognsvann is 18 minutes. The Oslo Metro is operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.\n\n[4] Common Tunnel: The station reopened on 7 March 1987, and took the name Stortinget, which derives from the Parliament of Norway Building (), which is adjacent to the station. Trains from the western network terminated at the old platforms, where the metro had previously terminated. The metro trains instead ran through a balloon loop. The station featured a step-free walk between the two systems. With the opening of Stortinget, the metro network was declared finished, after the last extension on the Furuset Line to Ellingsrudåsen had been made in 1981. On 7 October 1987, the city council decided to connect the four light rails west of the city center with the metro, allowing through trains. The Sognsvann Line was selected as the first line to be upgraded. The overhead wires were replaced with a third-rail power supply, automatic train protection was installed, platforms were built long enough to accommodate six-car trains instead of two-car trains, and the platform height was increased. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail power supply from Majorstuen to Stortinget. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-opened, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connecting to the Lambertseter Line. The new service used T1000 rolling stock.\n\n[5] Sognsvann Line: The line branches off from the Common Tunnel after Majorstuen, and heads northwards through the borough of Nordre Aker. The first two stations, Blindern and Forskningsparken, serve the Blindern campus of the University of Oslo. At Forskningsparken, there is transfer to the Ullevål Hageby Line of the Oslo Tramway, which allows connection with the two largest hospitals in the country: Rikshospitalet and Ullevål University Hospital. Ullevål stadion serves Norway's largest sports venue, Ullevål Stadion, the home ground of Norwegian Premier League side Vålerenga and the national football team.\n\n[6] List of Oslo Metro lines: Parts of the system have been upgraded from light rail to metro standard. The Østensjø and Lambertseter Lines were converted in 1966, when the first sections of new metro line were opened. The Sognsvann and Røa Lines, as well as the western part of the Common Tunnel, were upgraded in 1993 and 1995. The Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines were upgraded and subsequently re-opened in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Following the upgrade, all T1000 stock can be retired and replaced by the new MX3000 trains. The Grorud and Lambertseter Lines serve the Groruddalen valley while the Østensjø and Lambertseter Line serve the southern areas of Nordstrand. These four lines have the highest ridership. In the west, the Kolsås, Røa, Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Lines serves less densely populated areas. The Ring Line serves the northern borough of Nordre Aker, while the Common Tunnel serves the city center.\n\n[7] Sognsvann (station): Sognsvann is a rapid transit station of the Oslo Metro's Sognsvann Line. It is situated Kringsjå neighborhood of the Oslo, Norway, borough of Nordre Aker. Located from Stortinget, the station is served by Line 5 of the metro every fifteen minutes. Travel time to Stortinget is sixteen minutes.\n\n[8] Ring Line (Oslo): The Ring Line ( or ) is the newest rapid transit loop line of the Oslo Metro of Oslo, Norway. It connects to the Sognsvann Line in the west and the Grorud Line in the east; along with these two lines and the Common Tunnel, the Ring Line creates a loop serving both the city centre and Nordre Aker borough. The -long line has three stations: Nydalen, Storo and Sinsen. Four-fifths of the line runs within two tunnels, with the section between Storo and Sinsen, including both stations, being the only at-grade part. The line connects to the Grorud Line north of Carl Berners plass and with the Sognsvann Line north of Ullevål stadion.\n\n[9] Sognsvann (station): The station opened on 10 October 1934 at the same times as the rest of the Sognsvann Line. The station received a major upgrade in 1993, in which it received longer platforms. The new station was designed by Arne Henriksen. The station is located next to and serves the  Norwegian School of Sport Sciences and the National Archives of Norway, as well as the recreational area around the lake of Sognsvann.\n\n[10] Nationaltheatret (station): The station officially opened on 27 June 1928 by King Haakon VII. It became the first underground railway in the Nordic Countries, five years before Stockholm and six years before Copenhagen. The tunnel was long and trams used three to four minutes to run the length. The station would be used by two companies: Holmenkolbanen and Akersbanerne. Holmenkolbanen operated both the Røa Line and the Holmenkollen Line, but from the Sognsvann Line was connected to the tunnel from 10 October 1934, a financing solution needed to be made. In 1931, Aker Municipality purchasing the majority of Holmenkolbanen, and merging the Røa Line and Sognsvann Line into the company. In 1939, Bærumsbanen started the construction of a branch from the Lilleaker Line to Majorstuen. From 15 June 1942, the Kolsås Line, as it was renamed, started running via the tunnel to Nationaltheatret. Bærumsbanen became part of Oslo Sporveier in 1971.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Shortly after his death, Jobs's official biographer, Walter Isaacson, described him as the \"creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.\"\n\n[2] Shira Lazar: On September 9, 2011, someone at \"What's Trending\" erroneously posted that Apple CEO Steve Jobs had died on the official \"What's Trending\" Twitter account. The tweet had said \"Reports say that Steve Jobs has passed away. Stay tuned for more updates,” and was soon trending. The tweet was removed shortly thereafter, with Lazar apologizing, saying Jobs death was \"completely unconfirmed\". Later from her own Twitter account, Lazar apologized again for the inaccuracy of what had been tweeted. Hours after the first tweet was posted, CBS News severed ties with \"What's Trending\" and Lazar.\n\n[3] Steve Jobs: Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Jobs founded NeXT Inc. with $7 million. A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company. The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event, a lavish invitation only gala launch event that was described as a multimedia extravaganza. The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California on Wednesday October 12, 1988. Steve Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Jobs was at NeXT he was \"really getting his head together\".\n\n[4] NeXT Introduction: After Steve Jobs departed Apple three years prior to this event, he sank from sight only emerging once in 1986 to unveil the NeXT logo and once in early 1987 to announce that H. Ross Perot had invested $20 million in NeXT inc. Otherwise, Steve Jobs shunned public appearances at computer-industry events to avoid having to comment publicly about his new company's activities. But then he re-emerged with this Launch in what was described as having \"the subtlety of a Hollywood première\" in what was his first major public appearance since leaving Apple. Jobs hired multimedia artist George Coates to stage the unveiling.\n\n[5] Steve Jobs (film): Steve Jobs is a 2015 biographical drama film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Adapted from the 2011 book of the same name by Walter Isaacson as well as interviews conducted by Sorkin, the film is structured into three acts which cover 14 years (1984–1998) in the life of personal computing innovator and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs, with each act taking place immediately prior to the launch of a key product – the Apple Macintosh, the NeXT Computer and the iMac. Jobs is portrayed by Michael Fassbender, with Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles.\n\n[6] Apple Store: In 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned to Apple, Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell was asked how he would fix Apple. Dell responded: \"I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders\". This angered Jobs, due to Dell's success with its online store originally built by NeXT, Jobs' former business that Apple acquired to bring Jobs back. A team of Apple and NeXT employees spent several months building an online store that would be better than Dell's. On November 10, 1997, Steve Jobs announced the online store at an Apple press event, and during his keynote speech, he said: \"I guess what we want to tell you, Michael, is that with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order manufacturing, we're coming after you, buddy.\"\n\n[7] Steve Jobs (film): Edwin Catmull, president of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios, felt that Jobs would \"be appalled\" at his depiction in the film, arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture. In an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Catmull commented, \"When [Jobs] left Apple, he then entered into what really is the classic hero's journey: He's wandering in the wilderness, he's working with NeXT, it's not working. He's working with Pixar, we're failing. In that process, Steve learned some major lessons, and he changed. He became an empathetic person, [...] that aspect of the change of Steve was missed.\"\n\n[8] Michael Fassbender: Fassbender co-starred in \"Slow West\", a western starring Kodi Smit-McPhee and Ben Mendelsohn, in 2015. He played Silas, an enigmatic traveller. Fassbender played late Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs in the Danny Boyle-directed film \"Steve Jobs\", which began filming in January 2015, in San Francisco, U.S., and premiered in September of that year. The film is an adaptation of Walter Isaacson's book \"Steve Jobs\". The screenplay was written by Aaron Sorkin. Fassbender became attached after Christian Bale dropped out of the project. His performance saw him nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\n[9] Regis McKenna: He began working with Apple in 1976. In that year, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak “approached [him] and asked for help in launching what was to be the world's first personal computer.” He agreed, because he “liked Apple's vision.” A 2012 article explains that “When a young Steve Jobs needed a marketing expert, he called Intel to ask who made their sharp-looking ads and was told 'Regis McKenna.'”.\n\n[10] Michael Moritz: In 2009, 25 years after \"The Little Kingdom,\" Moritz published a revised and expanded follow-up: \"Return to the Little Kingdom: How Apple and Steve Jobs Changed the World\". In the prologue to \"Return to the Little Kingdom\", Moritz states that he was as incensed as Jobs was about the \"Time Magazine\" special issue: \"Steve rightly took umbrage over his portrayal and what he saw as a grotesque betrayal of confidences, while I was equally distraught by the way in which material I had arduously gathered for a book about Apple was siphoned, filtered, and poisoned with a gossipy benzene by an editor in New York whose regular task was to chronicle the wayward world of rock-and-roll music. Steve made no secret of his anger and left a torrent of messages on the answering machine I kept in my converted earthquake cottage at the foot of San Francisco’s Potrero Hill. He, understandably, banished me from Apple and forbade anyone in his orbit to talk to me. The experience made me decide that I would never again work anywhere I could not exert a large amount of control over my own destiny or where I would be paid by the word. I finished my leave [and] published my book, \"The Little Kingdom: The Private Story of Apple Computer\", which I felt, unlike the unfortunate magazine article, presented a balanced portrait of the young Steve Jobs.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

At the start of operations in 1908, the Emmentalbahn (Emmental Railway) took over operations of the line, which was owned by the \"Solothurn-Münster-Bahn\" (Solothurn-Moutier Railway, SMB). In 1997, it merged with the Emmental-Burgdorf-Thun-Bahn (EBT) and the Vereinigte Huttwil-Bahnen (United Huttwil Railways, VHB)—which already worked together for the operation of trains—to form the Regionalverkehr Mittelland (RM), which then took over the operation of the line. Since a merger in 2006, the line has been part of BLS, while passenger services have been operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) since 2010.\n\n[2] Solothurn–Moutier railway: Because the operation of the line would not have been profitable due to its short length, the Solothurn-Münster-Bahn transferred operations on to the line before the inauguration of the line to the Emmentalbahn, which also terminated in Solothurn. The line was opened on 3 August 1908. Construction had not been completed due to landslides and various other interruptions to works. Traffic initially developed well, mainly due to freight traffic, which was mainly served Von Roll and the Swiss Army. The beginning of the First World War also strongly affected operations on the line, so passenger services had to be severely restricted and the planned freight operations were completely abandoned because more extensive operations were no longer possible due to sharply increased coal prices. Although the timetable of 1921 showed the same number of services as before the war, the frequencies decreased, mainly because road transport was gradually becoming competitive. The line retained a certain importance for through traffic.\n\n[3] Sonceboz-Sombeval–Moutier railway: Since the opening of the Grenchenberg Tunnel in 1915 only regional trains have operated on the Sonceboz-Sombeval–Moutier line. Today one Regio service runs each hour from Biel via Sonceboz to Moutier and continues on the Solothurn–Moutier railway to Solothurn. This train is split or joined in Sonceboz-Sombeval, with the other part of the train going on to La Chaux-de-Fonds. The SBB took over 13 GTW sets from the BLS for the service in 2014.\n\n[4] Solothurn–Moutier railway: Electrical operations under the usual Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) AC system of 15 kV at 16⅔ Hz was recorded on 2 October 1932, leading to an increase in passenger service frequency. The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 had a major impact on the line from Solothurn to Moutier, as the Swiss Army made great use of the line for passenger and freight traffic. However, international through traffic collapsed in 1940. The war traffic ended from 20 August 1945.\n\n[5] Solothurn–Moutier railway: The recommissioning of the line was initially slow and it only regained a certain importance, this time touristic, with the opening of the Oberdorf–Weissenstein chairlift in 1952, the terminal station of which is located in the Oberdorf station area. The further significance of the line at this time was limited to its function as a feeder to the regional centres of Solothurn and Moutier. As a result, operations have focused on commuter traffic since the 1960s.\n\n[6] Solothurn–Wanzwil railway: The Solothurn–Wanzwil railway was opened on 12 December 2004 to connect with the Mattstetten–Rothrist new line (high-speed line) as part of a package of railways forming Rail 2000. The built route mostly uses the route of the Solothurn–Herzogenbuchsee railway, which was closed in 1992. The Solothurn–Wanzwil section is single-track and, together with the Mattstetten–Rothrist line, was the first line in Switzerland to use the European Train Control System in regular operation. The maximum speed from Solothurn to Subingen is 140 km/h and from there it is 200 km/h. The turnout at the transition to double-track can also be run at 200 km/h. The line is mainly used by the ICN services on the St. Gallen–Lausanne/Geneva route, which pass through without stopping between Olten and Solothurn. Additional colour light signalling was planned as a response to concerns that the ETCS system would not be ready for operation for the opening of the line (on 12 December 2004). Two conditions in the planning approval of the department of transport required that this fallback would be removed at the latest ten years after the start of operations. Additional work to optimise operations were planned as part of demolition work planned for late 2013 and early 2014, which were to cost CHF 7.4 million.\n\n[7] Solothurn–Worblaufen railway: The Solothurn–Worblaufen railway is a 29.71 kilometre-long, metre-gauge and electrified railway in the cantons of Bern and Solothurn in Switzerland. The Solothurn–Zollikofen section was opened in 1916 by the Elektrische Schmalspurbahn Solothurn–Bern (Solothurn–Bern Electric Narrow-gauge Railway, ESB), which was merged with the Bern–Zollikofen Railway to form the Solothurn-Zollikofen-Bern Bahn (Solothurn-Zollikofen-Bern Railway, SZB) in 1922. The Zollikofen–Worblaufen line was opened in 1924, allowing trains to run directly between Bern and Solothurn (until then passengers had to change in Zollikofen). The two companies were merged into the Regionalverkehr Bern–Solothurn (RBS) in 1984. Passenger traffic is now integrated into the Bern S-Bahn, while operation of the remaining freight traffic was transferred to SBB Cargo on December 2012. The line is served by line S8 and RE (RegioExpress) services. Worblaufen is the centre of operations and also has a depot and the RBS workshop. All trains run from Worblaufen ro Bern on the Zollikofen–Bern railway . The line is constantly being improved. Except for a short section, there are multiple tracks between Worblaufen and Jegenstorf and between Grafenried and Fraubrunnen.\n\n[8] Basel–Biel/Bienne railway: From Basel, the line runs past the Wolf freight yard and in the Birseck area through the suburbs of Münchenstein, Arlesheim, Dornach and Aesch. Here, the railway passes under Angenstein Castle through a short tunnel. The railway meanders along the Birs southwest to Grellingen. During the First and Second World War, the two railway bridges over the Birs in the Chessiloch area were guarded by Swiss Army troops. The crests of the regiments and inscriptions that were carved into the rock walls by the soldiers still exist. Running through the widening Laufen valley, the line passes through Laufen and Liesberg to reach , the capital of the French-speaking Canton of Jura. The historic Delémont roundhouse is located in Delémont. This former locomotive depot/roundhouse with a turntable is now the home of the \"Historische Eisenbahn Gesellschaft\" (Historical Railway Company, HEG), which focuses on the rescue, restoration and operation of historic Swiss rolling stock. The Delémont–Delle railway branches off at the station, passing through Porrentruy and Boncourt. It has been served hourly by the S3 service of the Regio S-Bahn Basel since December 2004. Trains must reverse in the station to continue towards Biel. After leaving the plain of Delémont, the line reaches Courrendlin and from there passes through the cliffs at Choindez and Roches. The line passes through a canyon that is typical for the Jura, having numerous short rock outcroppings. There are nine of them on the two-kilometre section between Roches and Moutier. The longest tunnel is 60 metres long, while the shortest is only seven metres long. The station of Moutier is also reached from the same side by the Sol\n\n[9] Moutier: During the 19th century and early 20th century, Moutier developed into a transportation hub. In 1876 a railway opened between Basel and Moutier. This first railroad was followed by a route to Biel through the Tavannes valley in 1877 and then to Solothurn in 1908. In 1915 the long Grenchenberg tunnel connected Moutier and Grenchen. The extensive road and railroad network encouraged Moutier to industrialize, with three industries, glass-making, watchmaking and automatic lathes, gaining international recognition for Moutier.\n\n[10] Solothurn–Moutier railway: In 1978, the final report of the commission for the Swiss transport concept was published, which recommended that the line be converted to bus operation and that the Weissenstein tunnel be converted into a road tunnel. However, the Federal Office of Transport and the Canton of Solothurn rejected these measures in 1984, mainly because the line was still of some importance for through freight traffic and major renewal of the infrastructure was not necessary.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

They were a part of the Russo-Turkish War (1686–1700) and Russo-Crimean Wars. These were the first Russian forces to come close to Crimea since 1569. They failed due to poor planning and the practical problem of moving such a large force across the steppe but nonetheless played a key role in halting the Ottoman expansion in Europe. The campaigns came as a surprise for the Ottoman leadership, spoiled its plans to invade Poland and Hungary and forced it to move significant forces from Europe to the east, which greatly helped the League in its struggle against the Ottomans.\n\n[2] Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689: The Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689 diverted some of the Ottoman and Crimean forces in favour of Russia's allies. They also led to the end of the alliance between the Crimean Khanate, France and Imre Thököly signed in 1683. However, the Russian army didn't reach the goal of stabilizing Russia's southern borders. The unsuccessful outcome of these campaigns was one of the reasons the government of Sophia Alekseyevna collapsed.\n\n[3] Crimean Campaign: The Crimea Campaign was an eight-month-long campaign by Axis forces to conquer the Crimea peninsula, and was the scene of some of the bloodiest battles on the Eastern Front during World War II. The German, Romanian, and defending Soviet troops suffered heavy casualties as the Axis forces tried to advance through the Isthmus of Perekop linking the Crimean peninsula to the mainland at Perekop, from summer of 1941 through to the first half of 1942.\n\n[4] History of the Russo-Turkish wars: Russia entered into another war with the Ottoman Empire in 1736, prompted by raids on Ukraine by Crimean Tatars and the military campaign of the Crimean khan in the Caucasus. In May 1736, the Russian army launched an invasion of the Crimean peninsula. On June 19, the Russian Don army (28,000 men) under the command of General Peter Lacy seized the fortress of Azov with the support of the Don Flotilla under the command of Vice Admiral Peter Bredahl. In July 1737, the Münnich army took by storm the Ottoman fortress of Ochakov. The Lacy army (now 40,000 strong) marched into the Crimea the same month, inflicting a number of defeats on the army of the Crimean khan and capturing Karasubazar. Lacy and his soldiers had to leave the Crimea, however, due to lack of supplies.\n\n[5] Crimean War: The Crimean campaign opened in September 1854. Three hundred and sixty ships sailed in seven columns, each steamer towing two sailing ships. Anchoring on 13 September in the bay of Eupatoria, the town surrendered and 500 marines landed to occupy it. This town and bay would provide a fall back position in case of disaster. The ships then sailed east to make the landing of the allied expeditionary force on the sandy beaches of Calamita Bay on the south west coast of the Crimean Peninsula. The landing surprised the Russians, as they had been expecting a landing at Katcha; the last minute change proving that Russia had known the original battle plan. There was no sign of the enemy and the men were all landed on 14 September. It took another four days to land all the stores, equipment, horses and artillery.\n\n[6] Crimean Khanate: The decline of the Crimean Khanate was a consequence of the weakening of the Ottoman Empire and a change in the balance of power in Eastern Europe favouring its neighbours. Crimean Tatars often returned from Ottoman campaigns without booty, and Ottoman subsidies were less likely for unsuccessful campaigns. Tatar cavalry, without sufficient guns, suffered great loss against European and Russian armies with modern equipment. By the late 17th century, Muscovite Russia became too strong a power for Crimea to pillage and the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699) outlawed further raids. The era of great slave raids in Russia and Ukraine was over, although brigands and Nogay raiders continued their attacks and Russian hatred of the Khanate did not decrease. These polito-economic losses led in turn to erosion of the khan's support among noble clans, and internal conflicts for power ensued. The Nogays, who provided a significant portion of the Crimean military forces, also took back their support from the khans towards the end of the empire.\n\n[7] Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689: In February 1689, 112,000 Russian troops and 350 guns set out. On 20 April they were joined at Novobogoroditskoye by 30-40,000 Cossacks under Mazepa. They followed the 1687 route, but marched in six separate columns and made much better time. By 3 May they were at the point where the 1687 expedition had turned back. On 15 and 16 May they were attacked by Crimean Tatars near Zelenaya Dolina and Chernaya Dolina. The Crimeans did fairly well but were driven back by the Russian's tabor defense and artillery. On 20 May they reached the isthmus of Perekop. Golitsyn was dismayed to find that all the grass in the area had been trampled down and that there was no source of drinking water north of the peninsula, thereby making a long siege or blockade impossible. Further on, the Tatars had dug a 7km ditch which made moving the artillery forward impossible. The next day, Golitsyn ordered his army to turn back.\n\n[8] Crimean War: As in the previous wars the Caucasus front was secondary to what was happening in the west. Perhaps because of better communications western events sometimes influenced the east. The main events were the second capture of Kars and a landing on the Georgian coast. Several commanders on both sides were either incompetent or unlucky and few fought aggressively.\n\n[9] Crimean War: The Crimean War (; or ; ; ) was a military conflict fought from October 1853 to February 1856 in which the Russian Empire lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense. It has widely been noted that the causes, in one case involving an argument over a key, have never revealed a \"greater confusion of purpose\", yet led to a war noted for its \"notoriously incompetent international butchery\".\n\n[10] Crimean campaign: Crimean campaign can refer to:\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Current Swedish Archaeology, Vol 11, 2003.\n\n[2] Zara Larsson: Larsson was born at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Stockholm County, Sweden, to Agnetha and Anders Larsson. In an interview with \"Svenska Dagbladet\", she said that she was born \"dead\" due to a lack of oxygen from nuchal cord. She has a younger sister, Hanna, who is also a singer and a member of the band Hanna & Andrea.\n\n[3] Stieg Larsson: Stieg Larsson was born on 15 August 1954, as Karl Stig-Erland Larsson, in Skelleftehamn, Västerbottens län, Sweden, where his father and maternal grandfather worked in the Rönnskärsverken smelting plant. Suffering from arsenic poisoning, his father resigned from his job, and the family subsequently moved to Stockholm. But because of their cramped living conditions, they chose to let one-year-old Larsson remain behind. So until the age of nine, Larsson lived with his grandparents in a small wooden house in the countryside, near the village of Bjursele in Norsjö Municipality, Västerbotten County. He attended the village school and used cross-country skis to get to and from school during the long, snowy winters in northern Sweden. He loved the experience of living there.\n\n[4] Hugo Larsson: Larsson was born in Brunnby, Malmöhus County, the son of sea captain Nils Larsson and his wife Hildur (née Elfverson). Larsson attended the Royal Institute of Technology in 1928 and was a engineer at the Swedish Board of Telecommunication (\"Telestyrelsen\") in 1928. Larsson was then technical officer at its Radio Division (\"Radiobyrån\") from 1938 to 1945 and associate professor (\"laborator\") at the Swedish National Defence Research Institute from 1945 to 1950. He was then head of the Electro Department at the Royal Swedish Air Force Materiel Administration from 1950 to 1952. Larsson was chief director and head of the Swedish National Defence Research Institute from 1952 to 1957 and director general in 1957. He was then technical director at Svenska AB Philips from 1957 to 1964.\n\n[5] Gottfrid Larsson: Julius Gottfrid Andreas Larsson was born in 1875 in Narveryd’s farm in Vallerstad in Mjölby Municipality, five kilometer northeast of Skänninge in Östergötland. His father was the farmer Anders Larsson. At the age of 14 he came to Norrköping in Östergötland where he stayed and worked as a wood carver and studied wood-carving (wood-engraving) at the Technical Evening School in 1889-1895. Then he came to Stockholm in 1895 and studied at the Tekniska skolan in Stockholm or Konstfack (Högre konstindustriella skolan) there in 1895-1899. In 1900 he received a travel grant from the Svenska Slöjdföreningen and Kommerskollegium and then he continued his studies in Paris at Académie Colarossi in Paris in 1900-1902. He assisted in the Royal Dramatic Theatre's decoration in Stockholm (\"Swedish\": Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern or Dramaten in Stockholm), and in 1905 he helped Carl Milles with his work for this theatre. The theatre has been at its present location in the Art Nouveau building at Nybroplan in Stockholm since 1908. Famous artists like Carl Milles and Carl Larsson were involved in making the decorations, and some of the interior decorations were made by Prince Eugen. After that Larsson continued his studies in Munich in 1905-1906 and he spent 1906-1907 in Italy.\n\n[6] Gottfrid Larsson: Gottfrid Larsson participated in exhibitions, among others in Saint Petersburg 1908, Munich 1909 and in San Francisco 1915. In 1935 Gottfrid Larsson had an exhibition in Konstnärshuset, together with the Swedish artist and designer Arthur Percy (1886–1976). Gottfrid Larsson’s fellow artist David Wallin arranged some of his exhibitions in Skänninge, an old built-up area from the medieval period, 5 km from Vallerstad in Östergötland, where Gottfrid Larsson was born.In Vadstena, in Skänningegatan 9, there is a sculpture museum called Gottfrid Larsson gården (Gottfrid Larsson garden), where the visitor can get acquainted with his work. After Gottfrid Larsson’s death in 1947 his wife Karen Larsson bought the so-called Möllergården in Skänningegatan 9 in Vadstena. In 1953 she donated the whole garden and the sculpture collection, consisting of 125 sculptures, to Vadstena Municipality. In 1979 the garden was opened to the public and Gottfrid Larsson’s many works could be exhibited.\n\n[7] SaRaha: Larsson was born on 26 June 1983 in Vänersborg, Sweden and soon moved to Tanzania with her family in 1985. At age 18, she moved to Zimbabwe which is where she began her music career, performing with Zimbabwean bands in Harare. She later returned to Tanzania in 2009. In 2011, she released the song \"Tanesco\" which became her breakout hit in Tanzania. She later released the song \"My Dear\", and released her debut album \"Mblele Kiza\" in 2014. The song \"Mbele Kiza\" later also gained attention in Sweden. She participated in Melodifestivalen 2016 with the song \"Kizunguzungu\", and qualified to andra chansen from the third semi-final. In the final she placed ninth with the juries, seventh with the Swedish public, and ninth overall.\n\n[8] Lars Osa: Lars Andersen was born in the village of Ulvik in Ulvik municipality in Hordaland county, Norway. When Lars Osa was five years old, the family moved from the (larger) village of Ulvik into the (very small) village of Osa, located about away, at the end of the Osa Fjord, an arm of the Hardangerfjord. He grew up in an environment characterized by a living folk tradition. He visited Knud Bergslien in Eidfjord and received his first art lessons from him. That same year he went to Christiania and was a pupil at Tegneskolen. In 1882 he was admitted as a student at the Art Academy in Copenhagen. He studied there until 1885, and continued as a student under the Danish painters Laurits Tuxen (1853–1927) and Peder Severin Krøyer until 1886. He used a travel scholarship for trips to Paris during the autumn and winter of 1897 and 1898.\n\n[9] Agnes Larson: Agnes Matilda Larson was born in Preston, Minnesota on 15 March 1892, sister of Henrietta Larson. She attended St. Olaf College, graduating with a B.A. in history and English. Larson taught high school in Walcott, North Dakota and Northfield, Minnesota and studied social work at the University of Chicago in the summer. She was awarded her M.A. by Columbia University in 1922 and she began teaching at Mankato State Teachers College. Larson started teaching at St. Olaf's in 1926 and she received another M.A. from Radcliffe College in 1929. Two years later she was awarded a fellowship by the American Association of University Women and she studied the white pine industry in Minnesota with Frederick Merk at Harvard University. The following year, she returned to Northfield to work on her thesis and catalog for the Norwegian-American Historical Association. Larson received her doctorate in 1938 and served as chair of the history department from 1942 to 1960, writing \"History of the White Pine Industry in Minnesota\". Just before her death on 24 January 1957, she finished \"John A. Johnson: An Uncommon American\".\n\n[10] Frank &amp; Lola: One night Frank is hired to cook dinner for Winkleman, who impressed with his culinary skills, flies him out to Paris for a trial with a French restauranter. Frank uses the trip as an opportunity to find Larsson and kill him. He tracks Larsson down using information he gathered online, and follows him to a local bistro. He introduces himself as \"Keith\", and tells Larsson that he read his memoirs while studying at Northwestern University, where Larsson was previously a professor. Impressed that Frank is a \"fan\", he invites him back to his place for a drink. Once there, Larsson becomes suspicious of Frank and deduces that Frank never attended Northwestern University and is in reality there to kill him. Frank confronts him with a knife he concealed in his sleeve about Lola's rape, which Larsson denies. Larsson then shows Frank a sex tape with Lola and another woman, that shows Lola taking sexual orders from Larsson. Larsson explains that the two of them were romantically involved and they had picked up the other woman from their favourite sex club. Larsson invites Frank to the club where he has a one night stand with a wealthy Parisian woman (Emmanuelle Devos) and her friend. Meanwhile, the restauranter is impressed with Frank and he gets a job as the head chief in their new Las Vegas restaurant.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Unable to generate response."}}

Heinz: The company continued to grow, and in 1888 Heinz bought out his other two partners and reorganized as the H. J. Heinz Company, the name carried to the present day. The company's slogan, \"57 varieties,\" was introduced by Heinz in 1896; by then the company was selling more than 60 different products. Heinz said he chose \"5\" because it was his lucky number and the number \"7\" was his wife's lucky number.\n\n[2] Heinz Tomato Ketchup: The \"57\" mark arises from an advertising statement that Heinz made \"57 Varieties\" of products. When Henry J. Heinz introduced the \"57 Varieties\" slogan, however, the company already made at least 60 products. The number is simply the combination of numbers Heinz and his wife considered \"lucky\".\n\n[3] Heinz 57: Henry J. Heinz introduced the marketing slogan \"57 pickle Varieties\" in 1896. He later claimed he was inspired by an advertisement he saw while riding an elevated train in New York City (a shoe store boasting \"21 styles\"). The reason for \"57\" is unclear. Heinz said he chose \"5\" because it was his lucky number and the number \"7\" was his wife's lucky number. However, Heinz also said the number \"7\" was selected specifically because of the \"psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages\". Whatever the reasons, Heinz wanted the company to advertise the greatest number of choices of pickles. In fact by 1892, four years before the slogan was created, the Heinz company was already selling more than 60 products.\n\n[4] Heinz 57: Heinz 57 is a synecdoche of the historical advertising slogan \"57 Varieties of Pickles\" by the H. J. Heinz Company located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. It has come to mean anything that is made from a large number of parts or origins. It was developed from the marketing campaign that told consumers about the numerous pickle products available from the Heinz company.\n\n[5] Heinz: Since 1896, the company has used its \"57 Varieties\" slogan; it was inspired by a sign advertising 21 styles of shoes, and Henry Heinz chose the number 57 even though the company manufactured more than 60 products at the time. In February 2013, Heinz agreed to be purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian 3G Capital for $23 billion. On March 25, 2015, Kraft announced its merger with Heinz, arranged by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. The resulting Kraft Heinz Company is the fifth largest food company in the world. Berkshire Hathaway became a majority owner of Heinz on June 18, 2015. After exercising a warrant to acquire 46 million shares of common stock for a total price of over $461 million, Berkshire increased its stake to 52.5%. The companies completed the merger on July 2, 2015.\n\n[6] Heinz: In 1888, Heinz bought out his other two partners and reorganized the company as the H. J. Heinz Company. Its slogan, \"57 varieties\", was introduced by Heinz in 1896. Inspired by an advertisement he saw while riding an elevated train in New York City (a shoe store boasting \"21 styles\"), Heinz picked the number more or less at random because he liked the sound of it, selecting \"7\" specifically because, as he put it, of the \"psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages.\"\n\n[7] Heinz 57: Heinz 57 figures in the plot of the novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\" when antagonist Mrs. Iselin lights upon a bottle of the product and adopts the number as an easy one for husband Senator John Iselin to remember as the number of Communists he charges are employed by the State Department. The 1962 film adaptation retains this, with a bottle of Heinz 57 sauce appearing on-screen moments before John Iselin cites the number in a speech.\n\n[8] Heinz: The H. J. Heinz Company, better known simply as Heinz, is an American food processing company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Originally, the company was founded by Henry John Heinz in 1869. Heinz manufactures thousands of food products in plants on six continents, and markets these products in more than 200 countries and territories. The company claims to have 150 number-one or number-two brands worldwide. Heinz ranked first in ketchup in the US with a market share in excess of 50%; the Ore-Ida label held 46% of the frozen potato sector in 2003.\n\n[9] Heinz: Henry J. Heinz began packing foodstuffs on a small scale at Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, in 1869. There he founded Heinz Noble & Company with a friend, L. Clarence Noble, and began marketing horseradish. The first product in Heinz and Noble's new Anchor Brand (a name selected for its biblical meaning of hope) was his mother Anna Heinz's recipe for horseradish. The young Heinz manufactured it in the basement of his father's former house.\n\n[10] Henry J. Heinz: Henry John Heinz (October 11, 1844 – May 14, 1919) was a German-American entrepreneur who founded the H. J. Heinz Company based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was born in that city, the son of German immigrants from the Palatinate who came independently to the United States in the early 1840s. Heinz developed his business into a national company which made more than 60 food products; one of its first was tomato ketchup. He was influential for introducing high sanitary standards for food manufacturing. He also exercised a paternal relationship with his workers, providing health benefits, recreation facilities, and cultural amenities. His descendants carried on the business until fairly recently, selling their remaining holdings to the predecessor company of what is now Kraft Heinz. Heinz was the great-grandfather of former U.S. Senator H. John Heinz III of Pennsylvania.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Best known for creating fraught environments that are both inviting and menacing, Henricksen came to prominence in 2005 for his work in the MoMA PS1 Greater New York Show.  His work is in the permanent collections of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C., The Fogg Museum at Harvard, and the Collezione Maramotti. Henricksen has shown internationally including John Connelly Presents, New York, hiromiyoshii, Tokyo, Arario,Seoul, and Gerhardsen Gerner, Berlin.  Solo museum shows include Bass Museum Miami and the Contemporary Gallery of the Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, New York.\n\n[2] Kent Henricksen: Henricksen's work has been reviewed in the \"New York Times\".\n\n[3] John Frederick Kensett: Kensett is best known for his landscape of upstate New York and New England and seascapes of coastal New Jersey, Long Island and New England. He is most closely associated with the \"second generation\" of the Hudson River School. Along with Sanford Robinson Gifford, Fitz Henry Lane, Jasper Francis Cropsey, Martin Johnson Heade and others, the works of the \"Luminists\", as they came to be known, were characterized by unselfconscious, nearly invisible brushstrokes used to convey the qualities and effects of atmospheric light. Such effects stemmed from Transcendentalist philosophies of sublime nature and contemplation bringing one closer to a spiritual truth. In 1848 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1849.\n\n[4] Carl Einstein: Einstein established a reputation as a well-known author and art critic on the basis of work ranging from his debut novel \"Bebuquin oder die Dilettanten des Wunders\", to his widely read work on African sculpture \"Negerplastik\" (\"Negro Sculpture\"), credited as being one of the first important books acknowledging African art in Europe (and especially its relationship to Cubism), the final volume of the prestigious Propyläen Verlag history of art series \"Die Kunst des 20. Jahrhunderts\" (\"Art of the 20th Century\"), which may have gained him an invitation to teach at the Bauhaus (he declined), to the notorious play \"Die Schlimme Botschaft\". Another Africa-related book is \"Afrikanische Märchen und Legenden\", a compilation of African mythology in very expressive language. Einstein also worked on numerous journals and collective projects, among some of the more important: \"Die Aktion\" edited by Franz Pfemfert, \"Die Pleite\" and \"Der Blutige Ernst\" with George Grosz, and the legendary journal \"Documents: Doctrines, Archéologie, Beaux-arts, Ethnographie\" edited with Georges Bataille.\n\n[5] Kevin Henkes: Henkes' first book, \"All Alone\", was published in 1981 by Greenwillow Books. More than 30 books followed, including \"Chrysanthemum\" and \"Lilly's Purple Plastic Purse\". In 1994 Henkes was a runner-up for one of the premier American Library Association children's book awards, the Caldecott Medal for \"Owen\", one of his mouse books. In 2004, he was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal for \"Olive's Ocean.\" The next year he won the Caldecott Medal for \"Kitten's First Full Moon\", recognizing that as the year's best children's picture book published in the U.S. All of his books to date have been published by Greenwillow Books.\n\n[6] Henrik Hagtvedt: Henrik Hagtvedt is a Norwegian visual artist (born January 6, 1971 in Sandefjord, Norway) working predominantly with acrylics and oils, as well as with sculpture, graphics and other media. In the years following his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy, his work had a rapid rise to fame and was exhibited in a number of galleries in both Europe and Asia, ranging from the Museo Montelupo in Italy to the Cultural Foundation (national gallery) in the United Arab Emirates. Although he has painted in a variety of styles, from abstract to photo-realism, Henrik Hagtvedt is most famous for a thickly textured and highly expressive style which gained him a great deal of critical acclaim and media attention early in his career. It was presumably this style that earned him the nickname “The Northern Light,” first given to him in Italy. However, little time elapsed before Hagtvedt began declining exhibitions and distancing himself from the contemporary art scene, thus virtually disappearing from both the public eye and from mainstream art institutions, almost as suddenly as he had appeared upon the scene some years earlier.\n\n[7] Bruce Henricksen: After surgery for throat cancer in 1996, Henricksen returned to Minnesota to live with his new wife, Victoria. There, what had previously been a secondary endeavor, writing fiction, became the primary one. His short stories appeared in numerous magazines, and in 2005 his story collection, \"Ticket to a Lonely Town\", was the only named finalist in the national competition for the Grace Paley Prize. It was published the following year by Atomic Quill Press. Stories in this book are connected by recurrent characters and places, as the collection dramatizes various causes and forms of loneliness. In 2008 his novel, \"After the Floods\" (Lost Hills Books) appeared. Praised by the New Orleans \"Times-Picayune\" as a \"thoroughly enjoyable flight of fancy\" and \"a spiritual comedy,\" the novel, set partially in post-Katrina New Orleans, combines magical realism and deconstruction in a manner at once imaginative and excessible. Also in 2008, Henricksen co-edited a volume in honor of a former mentor, \"From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright\" (Lost hills Books), to which many of our best-known poets contributed.\n\n[8] Ernest Law: His best-known work was \"A Short History of Hampton Court\" (1897), abridged from his longer histories. He also wrote \"History of Hampton Court\", \"Royal Gallery of Hampton Court\", \"Vandyck's and Holbein's Pictures at Windsor Castle\", \"Kensington Palace\", \"Shakespeare as a Groom of the Chamber\" (1910), \"Some Supposed Shakespeare Forgeries\" (1911), \"Dancing on Ice\" (1911), \"More about Shakespeare Forgeries\" (1913), \"England’s First Great War Minister\" (1916), \"The Tempest as originally produced at Court\" (1920), \"Mantegna's Triumph of Julius Cæsar, as now hung in the old Orangery at Hampton Court\" (1921), \"Commonwealth or Empire\" (1921), \"Shakespeare’s Garden\" (1922), \"Henry VIII's Great Kitchen at Hampton Court\", and \"Hampton Court Gardens: Old and New\" (1926).\n\n[9] Axel Jensen: Jensen is perhaps most famous for having written the science fiction novels \"Epp\" (1965), \"Lul\" (1992), and \"And the Rest is Written in the Stars\" (1995), illustrated by Pushwagner. With these novels, Jensen created a dystopian vision of the future, much in the tradition of Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and Ray Bradbury. Nevertheless, Jensen's novels also differ from these authors since the tragic vision in his novels is supplemented with comedy, setting an ambiguous and absurd tone. In this way, Jensen's novels are similar to the satirical and parodic novels of Jonathan Swift and Kurt Vonnegut.\n\n[10] Clifford A. Henricksen: Cliff Henricksen is a musician, inventor and audio technologist. He is self-taught as a musician with a graduate degree in mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Throughout his career Cliff has found innovative ways to apply engineering basics to electro acoustics and to audio technology as it applies to music and in particular to live music performance. He has invented and engineered a wide variety of technologies and products well known in the world of professional audio. Today he balances work in audio and work as a performing musician.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) ruled all of China for about a century, and dominated Northern China for more than 140 years, since the time when the Jurchen Jin dynasty was annihilated. As Han Chinese people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts, floods and the ensuing famines since the late 1340s, however, the government's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support. In 1351, the Red Turban Rebellion started and grew into a nationwide turmoil. Eventually, Zhu Yuanzhang, a Han Chinese peasant, established the Ming dynasty in South China, and sent an army toward the Yuan capital Khanbaliq or Dadu (present-day Beijing) in 1368. Toghon Temür (r. 1333–70), the last ruler of the Yuan, fled north to Shangdu (located in present-day Inner Mongolia) from Dadu in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the Míng dynasty (1368–1644). He had tried to regain Dadu, but eventually failed; he died in Yingchang (located in present-day Inner Mongolia) two years later (1370). Yingchang was seized by the Ming shortly after his death.\n\n[2] Ming dynasty: The Ming dynasty () was the ruling dynasty of China – then known as the – for 276 years (1368–1644) following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty in China ruled by ethnic Han Chinese. Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng (who established the Shun dynasty, soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty), regimes loyal to the Ming throne – collectively called the Southern Ming – survived until 1683.\n\n[3] List of emperors of the Ming dynasty: The Ming dynasty ruled China from 1368 to 1644, succeeding the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and falling amidst much peasant turmoil to the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty. Sixteen emperors ruled over the whole of China spanning 276 years. A series of claimants to the Ming throne continued to claim the throne of what was known as the Southern Ming until the last was executed in 1662.\n\n[4] Shunzhi Emperor: From 1643 to 1650, political power lay mostly in the hands of Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing Empire conquered most of the territory of the fallen Ming dynasty (1368–1644), chased Ming loyalist regimes deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China despite highly unpopular policies such as the \"hair cutting command\" of 1645, which forced Qing subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a queue resembling that of the Manchus. After Dorgon's death on the last day of 1650, the young Shunzhi Emperor started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s, he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing Empire's last enemies, seafarer Koxinga (1624–1662) and the Prince of Gui (1623–1662) of the Southern Ming dynasty, both of whom would succumb the following year. The Shunzhi Emperor died at the age of 22 of smallpox, a highly contagious disease that was endemic in China, but against which the Manchus had no immunity. He was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who had already survived smallpox, and who reigned for sixty years under the era name \"Kangxi\" (hence he was known as the Kangxi Emperor). Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later eras of the Qing dynasty, the Shunzhi era is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.\n\n[5] History of the Ming dynasty: The Ming dynasty (January 23, 1368 – April 25, 1644), officially the Great Ming or Empire of the Great Ming, founded by the peasant rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang, known as the Hongwu Emperor, was an imperial dynasty of China. It was the successor to the Yuan dynasty and the predecessor of the short-lived Shun dynasty, which was in turn succeeded by the Qing dynasty. At its height, the Ming dynasty had a population of 160 million people, while some assert the population could actually have been as large as 200 million.\n\n[6] Modern history: The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) was founded after the fall of the Ming, the last Han Chinese dynasty, by the Manchus. The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens. When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng's peasant rebels in 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. Schoppa, the editor of \"The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History\" argues, \"A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\"\n\n[7] Qing poetry: The Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China, ruling from 1644 to 1911 with a brief restoration, in 1917. The Qing Dynasty was preceded by the Ming Dynasty and followed by the Republic of China. The dynasty was founded by the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan in contemporary Northeastern China, under the rule of Nurhaci, a former vassal of the Ming emperors. By 1635, Nurhaci's son Hong Taiji could claim they constituted a single and united Manchu people and eventually they seized control of Beijing and overthrew Li Zicheng's short-lived Shun Dynasty, completing their conquest of China around 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor. Over the course of its reign, the Qing integration with Chinese culture included the continuation of Chinese literature and Classical Chinese poetry. The imperial examinations continued and Han civil servants administered the empire alongside Manchu ones.\n\n[8] History of China: The Qing dynasty (1644–1911) was the last imperial dynasty in China. Founded by the Manchus, it was the second conquest dynasty to rule the entire territory of China and its people. The Manchus were formerly known as Jurchens, residing in the northeastern part of the Ming territory outside the Great Wall. They emerged as the major threat to the late Ming dynasty after Nurhaci united all Jurchen tribes and established an independent state. However, the Ming dynasty would be overthrown by Li Zicheng's peasants rebellion, with Beijing captured in 1644 and the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committing suicide. The Manchus allied with the former Ming general Wu Sangui to seize Beijing, which was made the capital of the Qing dynasty, and then proceeded to subdue the Ming remnants in the south. The decades of Manchu conquest caused enormous loss of lives and the economic scale of China shrank drastically. In total, the Qing conquest of the Ming (1618–1683) cost as many as 25 million lives. Nevertheless, the Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule and were considered a Chinese dynasty.\n\n[9] Qing dynasty: The Qing dynasty, officially the Great Qing (), was the last imperial dynasty of China. It was established in 1636, and ruled China proper from 1644 to 1912. It was preceded by the Ming dynasty and succeeded by the Republic of China. The Qing multi-cultural empire lasted for almost three centuries and formed the territorial base for modern China. It was the fifth largest empire in world history.\n\n[10] Battle of Beijing (1644): Li Zicheng led his rebel army to attack the Ming capital Beijing from two directions (north and south). The eunuch official Du Zhizhi (杜之秩) ordered the Ming forces defending Beijing to open the city gates and let Li Zicheng's army in. After the fall of Beijing, the last Ming ruler, the Chongzhen Emperor, committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree near the Forbidden City. No actual battle was fought in Beijing itself because the rebels marched on the capital unopposed, and even after occupying Beijing, the rebels did not face any resistance. Li Zicheng then proceeded to establish the short-lived Shun Dynasty, which was subsequently defeated by forces of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty. The Qing dynasty would go on to rule China, a reign that lasted 268 years.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He travels to the museum, discovering most of the exhibits will be moved to the Federal Archives at the Smithsonian Institution and replaced with holographic information providers. The Tablet of Ahkmenrah is to remain in the museum, leaving most of the exhibits without the ability to come to life at night. After the exhibits are moved, Larry receives a phone call from Jedediah, who informs him that Dexter the monkey stole the tablet and took it to the Smithsonian, bringing every exhibit in it to life. Larry travels to Washington, DC, navigating his way to the archives with help from his son Nick while posing as a night guard.\n\n[4] Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (video game): Larry Daley is the CEO and founder of the company Daley Devices, and learns that the Museum of Natural History, where he once worked as a night guard and found out that the exhibits come to life every night, is having renovations, replacing the wax figures and stuffed animals with state-of-the-art 3D holograms. Larry returns to the museum, where he learns from Jedidiah the miniature cowboy and Octavius the Roman general that because of the renovations, they will be shipped to the Federal Archives (Octavius mistakenly calls it the Imperial Archives) under the Smithsonian Museum, aside from Rexy the T-Rex skeleton, Ahkmenrah and his tablet, (which is the source which makes the exhibits come to life) the Easter Island Head (nicknamed Dumb-dumb), and other signature exhibits will be staying. Larry meets with Ahkmenrah, who teaches him about the several ingots the tablet consists of, explaining that each ingot has a different power. He tells Larry he can use the tablet's powers using his flashlight and key-chain.\n\n[5] Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian: Like its predecessor, the sequel has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 44% \"rotten\" approval rating, based on 163 reviews, with an average score of 5.1/10, making it just barely the highest reviewed film of the series. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Night at the Museum: Battle at the Smithsonian\" is busy enough to keep the kids interested but the slapstick goes overboard and the special effects (however well executed) throw the production into mania\". Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, gave the film an average score of 42 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\n[6] Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian: Amelia flies Larry and the New York exhibits back home, giving Larry a final kiss before taking off in her plane, knowing she will become dust before reaching the Smithsonian.  Two months later, Larry sells his company, donating the money to the museum to renovate it, and the exhibits remain, capable of moving about at night under the pretense of being animatronics. Larry is rehired as a night guard and aids a woman who resembles Amelia during the debut of the museum's new extension of visiting hours. Writers Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon confirmed to Dark Horizons that they were writing a sequel to \"Night at the Museum,\" originally with the tentative title \"Another Night at the Museum\".

Scenes were also shot at the American Museum of Natural History in New York on August 18 and 20, 2008.\n\n[9] Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian: Ben Stiller admitted that a sequel was \"a possibility\" and on January 22, 2010, co-writer Thomas Lennon said to \"Access Hollywood\", \"That after the success of two \"Night at the Museum\" films, it's no surprise that 20th Century Fox is looking to develop a third and that those suspicions are indeed true and how could you not? I think it's a really outstanding idea to do \"Night at the Museum 3\", in fact,\" he said. \"I wonder if someone's not even already working on a script for that,\" he added with a raised eyebrow. \"I cannot confirm that for a fact, but I cannot deny it for a fact either... It might be in the works.\" In an interview, Stiller confirmed the sequel, however, he said that it was only in the \"ideas stage\".\n\n[10] Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (video game): In the end, there is a huge battle over the finished tablet, which is won by Larry's friends and Larry banishes Kahmunrah to the Underworld. Like the movie, the game ends with the museum being open late at night and Larry telling his boss Dr. McPhee that he stuck motors in the exhibits, while he actually just brought the tablet home, and having the exhibits come back to life.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

They marked the start of the Middle Ages of European history. The term \"Late Antiquity\" is used to emphasize elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while \"Early Middle Ages\" is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the earlier medieval period. As such it overlaps with Late Antiquity, following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, and precedes the High Middle Ages (c. 10th to 13th centuries).\n\n[4] Late Middle Ages: The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history lasting from 1250 to 1500 AD. The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern period (and in much of Europe, the Renaissance).\n\n[5] Henry Hallam: Hallam described his work \"Middle Ages\" as a series of historical dissertations for the period from the 5th to the 15th century. The work consists of nine long chapters: the histories of France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and of the Greek and Saracenic empires, fill five chapters. Others deal with major institutional features of medieval society: the feudal system, the ecclesiastical system, and the political system of England. The last chapter sketches society, commerce, manners, and literature in the Middle Ages.\n\n[6] Lindon (Middle-earth): Círdan stayed in Mithlond into the Fourth Age until as he said, \"the last ship sails\" and the remaining Eldar passed into the West. A small Elven community may have remained for quite some time. It is unclear just what the fate of the Elves of Middle-earth was in the early Fourth Age or how long Círdan and his remaining folk dwelled at the Havens and continued to build the great ships that carried the Elves to the Undying Lands.\n\n[7] History of the world: The Middle Ages witnessed the first sustained urbanization of northern and western Europe. Many modern European states owe their origins to events unfolding in the Middle Ages; present European political boundaries are, in many regards, the result of military and dynastic events during this tumultuous period. The Middle Ages lasted until the beginning of the Early modern period in the 16th century, marked by the rise of nation states, the division of Western Christianity in the Reformation, the rise of humanism in the Italian Renaissance, and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the Columbian Exchange.\n\n[8] Middle Ages: Historians from Romance-speaking countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: an earlier \"High\" and later \"Low\" period. English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the Middle Ages into three intervals: \"Early\", \"High\", and \"Late\". In the 19th century, the entire Middle Ages were often referred to as the \"Dark Ages\", but with the adoption of these subdivisions, use of this term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages, at least among historians.\n\n[9] Women in the Middle Ages: Midwifery was practised informally, gradually becoming a specialized occupation in the Late Middle Ages. Women often died in childbirth, although if they survived the child-bearing years, they could live as long as men, even into their 70s. Life expectancy for women rose during the High Middle Ages, due to improved nutrition.\n\n[10] Peter Brown (historian): Janet Nelson, the distinguished British historian of the early Middle Ages, has said: \"He took the study of medieval history into fields of cultural history and social history, social psychological history. He was interested in religion but not in an old-fashioned ecclesiastical history, institutional sort of way, but what made people think in this way: how did they conceptualise God? How did they think about religious symbols and rituals in the ways that they did? Why did these things change? That was his agenda. He wrote mostly about late antiquity, the very early period, but he sometimes ventured into the Middle Ages and whenever he did he transformed the scene. The great area he’s famous for doing is the cult of the saints.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is produced by ITV Studios and broadcast on Channel 4. It is currently presented by Nick Hewer, assisted by Rachel Riley, with regular lexicographer Susie Dent. It was the first programme to be aired on Channel 4, and 78 series have been broadcast since its debut on 2 November 1982. With over 6,500 episodes, \"Countdown\" is one of the longest-running game shows in the world, along with the original French version, \"Des chiffres et des lettres\" (Numbers & Letters), which has been running on French television continuously since 1965. \"Countdown\" was initially recorded at The Leeds Studios for 27 years, before moving to Manchester-based Granada Studios in 2009. Following the development of MediaCityUK, Countdown moved again in 2013 to the new purpose build studios at Dock10, Greater Manchester.\n\n[2] Countdown (game show): Many lexicographers have appeared over the years, but since her debut in 1992, Susie Dent has become synonymous with the role, and has made over three thousand appearances, becoming the permanent lexicographer in 2003. The celebrity guest, sometimes known as the \"Dictionary Dweller\", also contributes words, and provides a short interlude halfway through the second section of the show. These guests have included Nigel Rees, Jo Brand, Martin Jarvis, Richard Digance, Geoffrey Durham, Ken Bruce, Magnus Magnusson, Pam Ayres, Paul Zenon and John Sergeant, and, most regularly, Gyles Brandreth, providing poems, anecdotes, puzzles and magic tricks. Alison Heard replaced Susie Dent over the winter of 2007–08, whilst Dent was on maternity leave. Dent returned to the series on 6 February 2008.\n\n[3] Susie Dent: Dent is well known as the resident lexicographer and adjudicator for the letters rounds on Channel 4's long-running game show \"Countdown\". On each episode, she also provides a brief commentary on the origin of a particular word or phrase. Dent is the longest-serving member of the show's current on-screen team, having first appeared in 1992; she has made over 2500 appearances.\n\n[4] Susie Dent: Susie Dent (born ) is an English lexicographer and etymologist. She has appeared in \"Dictionary Corner\" on the Channel 4 game show \"Countdown\" every year since 1992. She also appears on \"8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown\", a post-watershed comedy version of the show presented by comedian Jimmy Carr. She has been Honorary Vice-President of the Society for Editors and Proofreaders (SfEP) since 2016.\n\n[5] Matt Le Tissier: In 2009, Le Tissier made an appearance on the Channel 4 game show, \"Countdown\", as the Dictionary Corner guest, next to \"Countdown's\" resident lexicographer, Susie Dent. He would make 10 appearances over two spells in 2009 and 2010. On 28 September 2015, Le Tissier became the first former guest to become a contestant on the show. He won three shows, including scoring two centuries, before losing on his 4th appearance to John Hardie, who would reach the quarter-finals at the end of that series.\n\n[6] 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown: The first episode aired as part of Channel 4's \"mash-up night\" on 2 January 2012; the first full series was aired in July 2013 and multiple series have since been commissioned. Episodes feature Jimmy Carr as host; two teams of two contestants feature in most episodes, with Sean Lock and Jon Richardson as permanent team captains (various other personalities, such as Lee Mack, Sarah Millican, Bill Bailey and Claudia Winkleman, deputise when either captain is unavailable to film). Rachel Riley and Susie Dent take up their regular roles from \"Countdown\"; Joe Wilkinson appears in many earlier episodes as Rachel's assistant and has also stood in as a team captain.\n\n[7] Countdown (game show): The other studio mainstay is Dictionary Corner, which houses a lexicographer and that week's celebrity guest (referred to as \"GoD\" or \"Guardian of the Dictionaries\"). Initially farmer and broadcaster Ted Moult was on hand for verification. The role of the lexicographer is to verify the words offered by the contestants (see \"Letters round rules\") and point out any longer or otherwise interesting words available. The lexicographer is aided in finding these words by the show's producers, Michael Wylie (until his death in November 2008) and Damian Eadie. The production team is insistent that no computer program is used in this role, and that the words suggested in Dictionary Corner have been found manually.\n\n[8] Channel 4: Following the announcement, the channel headed into a montage of clips from its programmes set to the station's signature tune, \"Fourscore\", written by David Dundas, which would form the basis of the station's jingles for its first decade. The first programme to air on the channel was the teatime game show \"Countdown\", at 16:45 produced by Yorkshire Television. The first person to be seen on Channel 4 was Richard Whiteley with Ted Moult being the second. The first woman on the channel, contrary to popular belief, was not Whiteley's \"Countdown\" co-host Carol Vorderman but a lexicographer only ever identified as Mary. Whiteley opened the show with the words:\n\n[9] Jeff Stelling: On 21 November 2008, it was reported that Stelling had been confirmed as the new host of the Channel 4 game show \"Countdown\" following the departure of Des O'Connor. He had reportedly also been approached for the role following the death of long-time host Richard Whiteley, but the role was given to former fellow sports presenter Des Lynam instead. Stelling began recording \"Countdown\" in December 2008, with the show's new assistant Rachel Riley, and started broadcasting in January 2009. He also appears during an episode of \"The IT Crowd\" in the same role. However, it was announced on 25 May 2011 that Stelling would be stepping down as presenter of \"Countdown\" at the end of the year, after three years at the helm, to concentrate on football, including his new Champions League role. He was replaced by Nick Hewer.\n\n[10] Countdown (game show): Lynam's departure was due to travel requirements for the demanding filming schedule, with the show recorded in Leeds and Lynam living away in Worthing, West Sussex. Channel 4 had tried an extra programme on Saturday in early 2006 which Lynam had agreed to, subject to part of the filming schedule being moved nearer to his home. However, viewers reacted angrily to the idea of the show leaving Leeds, and when Lynam found out that a move would cause considerable disruption for many of the programme's camera crew, he decided to leave. On 7 November 2006, it was announced that Des O'Connor would succeed Lynam as host. Lynam's final show as \"Countdown\" presenter was broadcast on 22 December 2006. O'Connor first presented Countdown on 2 January 2007.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The neoclassical building is located immediately to the north of the Lion's Mound on the battlefield of the Battle of Waterloo in the municipality of Braine-l'Alleud in the Belgian province of Walloon Brabant.\n\n[2] Battle of Waterloo reenactment: The Battle of Waterloo reenactment is an annual modern recreation of the 19th century Battle of Waterloo on the original battlefield in Waterloo, Belgium.  It is held every June on the weekend nearest to the historic date of the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815). In a regular year there will be 600–800 reenactors. The 5-year-anniversaries are greater events with 1,500–2,000 reenactors from France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany, Poland and Russia.\n\n[3] Waterloo, Belgium: There is a memorial in the form of a statue of a lion (looking towards France) on a hill, with 226 stairs, called the Lion's Mound. It was erected on the famous 1815 battlefield located south of Waterloo, and was completed in 1826. A fee is no longer charged to climb the hill, which has become a major tourist attraction in the region.\n\n[4] The Field of Waterloo: The Field of Waterloo is a poem by Sir Walter Scott, written and published in 1815. After the allied victory at the battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815,  Scott travelled to Belgium in August, and was one of the first British civilians to visit the battlefield. Scott was hoping to recover his expenses by publishing an account of his travels (in the form of imaginary letters), published as \"Paul's Letters to His Kinsfolk\" (1816).\n\n[5] Battle of Waterloo: The battlefield is located in the municipalities of Braine-l'Alleud and Lasne, about south of Brussels, and about from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the Lion's Mound, constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n[6] Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo: On the morning of 18 June those Prussians who had not already done so crossed the Dyle in and around Wavre and headed westwards towards the Waterloo battlefield. Grouchy was at Sart-lez-Walhain when at about 11:30 he and his staff heard the sound of cannonades in the distance, which a local notary said sounded as if it was coming from what is now known as the battlefield of Waterloo. This was in a north-westerly direction, at a distance of about as the crow flies, with no direct roads between Grouchy's position and the battlefield. The distance to Wavre (nor'-nor'-west) was about with some larger minor road leading there. After considering his options, Grouchy decided to advance to Wavre and engage whatever Prussians he found there, and so aid Napoleon by preventing those Prussians from moving towards Waterloo.\n\n[7] List of Waterloo Battlefield locations: The Waterloo Battlefield is located in the municipalities of Braine-l'Alleud and Lasne and Waterloo, about south of Brussels, and about from the town of Waterloo. The ordering of the places in the list is north to south and west to east.\n\n[8] Waterloo (video game): The game was innovative in being played from the point of view of the commander, with the battlefield rendered in simple three-dimensional perspective rather than the overhead view traditionally typical of battlefield strategy games. This means that the player's knowledge of the progress of the battle is limited to what he can see with his own eyes and the reports of subordinates. The player may move around the battlefield to better observe events, but risks death or capture if he approaches too close to the front.\n\n[9] Regional Municipality of Waterloo: Before and during World War I, there was some anti-German sentiment in Canada and some cultural sanctions on the community, particularly in Berlin, Ontario. However, by 1919 most of the population of what would become Kitchener-Waterloo and Elmira were Canadian by birth; over 95 percent had been born in Ontario.  Those of the Mennonite religion were pacifist, so they could not enlist, while others who were not born in Canada refused to fight against the country of their birth. The anti-German sentiment was the primary reason for the Berlin to Kitchener name change in 1916.  The Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower built in 1926 commemorates the settlement by the Pennsylvania Dutch (\"Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch\" or Pennsylvania German) of the Grand River area in what later became Waterloo County.\n\n[10] Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo: Grouchy arrived at Wavre at around 16:00 and immediately engaged the Prussian III Corps (Thielemann's), which was acting as the rearguard of the Prussian army and which had been about to leave for Waterloo) in what became the Battle of Wavre. The Prussian advance to the Waterloo battlefield was impeded by the swollen streams, which had turned their valleys into muddy swamps, in particular the valley of the small river Lasne close to Saint-Lambert, but not by any French forces as Napoleon had neglected to send patrols out on his right flank. The Prussian vanguard started to arrive in strength out of the Wood of Paris at around 17:00 on 18 June and were soon attacking the right flank of Napoleon's army engaged in the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Vesuvius?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Ercolano: IN 1631 Mt. Vesuvius violently erupted after a long era of quiescence destroying the area all around, killing more than 4.000 people and altering the geography of the places. It was the second most devastating eruption of Mt. Vesuvius ever, after the one that destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum in AD 79. The territory of Resina was struck by two legs of lava that split behind the hill of Pugliano and spared the houses of the village; one of the legs filled the valley on the western side of it and when it solidified the village grew on the new plain and the large via Pugliano was built heading straight to the basilica on the top of the hill.\n\n[2] Mount Vesuvius: Mount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis and Stabiae, as well as several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of , spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of per second, ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. More than 1,000 people died in the eruption, but exact numbers are unknown. The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.\n\n[3] Stratovolcano: The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 completely smothered the nearby ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum with thick deposits of pyroclastic surges and lava flows. Although death toll is estimated between 13,000 and 26,000 remains, the exact number still remains unknown. Vesuvius is recognized as one of the most dangerous volcanoes, due to its capacity for powerful explosive eruptions combined with the high population density of the surrounding Metropolitan Naples area (totaling about 3.6 million inhabitants).\n\n[4] Ottaviano: The city has long suffered from eruptions of Vesuvius, and in particular was almost completely buried by volcanic ash from Vesuvius's eruption of 1631, 1779 and 1906. According to Sir William Hamilton, during the first and second eruptions Ottaviano \"was buried like Pompeii\", and also in the third, as testified by Matilde Serao, who called the city \"the new Pompeii\". In the third eruption also the roof of the Mother Church of San Michele Arcangelo collapsed under the weight of the ash, but without killing anyone.\n\n[5] Disaster tourism: When the nearby volcano Mt Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, the eruption buried the city of Pompeii and the nearby city of Herculaneum and preserved everything from its streets to its frescoes under mounds of pumice and ash. Although Pompeii was initially rediscovered in 1599, tourism was undesirable until Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre performed a much larger evacuation in 1748, which revealed many noteworthy structures, such as a fully intact Roman theatre.\n\n[6] Titus: Although his administration was marked by a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced a number of major disasters during his brief reign. On 24 October 79, four months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted. The eruption almost completely destroyed the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava, killing thousands. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year.\n\n[7] Mount Vesuvius: The volcano ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of , spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of per second, ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed by pyroclastic surges and the ruins buried under tens of metres of tephra.\n\n[8] Mount Vesuvius: The eruption of April 5 in 1906 killed more than 100 people and ejected the most lava ever recorded from a Vesuvian eruption. Italian authorities were preparing to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, devastating the city of Naples and surrounding comunes. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of Naples, requiring a new location for the Olympics to be found.\n\n[9] Mount Vesuvius: The last major eruption was in March 1944. It destroyed the villages of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, Massa di Somma, and Ottaviano, and part of San Giorgio a Cremano. From March 18 to 23, 1944, lava flows appeared within the rim. There were outflows. Small explosions then occurred until the major explosion took place on March 18, 1944.\n\n[10] San Giorgio a Cremano: Between 1140 and 1631 Mount Vesuvius had remained dormant for nearly 500 years, but a violent and sudden eruption in December 1631 was particularly devastating for San Giorgio a Cremano, destroying the new town centre and the sixty-year-old church of Santa Maria del Principio. The 1631 eruption was particularly violent, with several lava flows pouring down different faces of the volcano accompanied by torrents of boiling water, as well as throwing pumice and hot ash into the sky.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It operated successfully into the 1930s, struggled financially during the Depression, and was saved from abandonment by a dramatic ridership increase due to the Second World War. In 1951, the LVT, once again financially struggling, ended its interurban rail service from Allentown to Philadelphia. In 1952, it ended its Allentown area local trolley service. It operated local bus service in the Allentown, Bethlehem, and Easton, Pennsylvania areas until going out of business in 1972.\n\n[2] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: The Lehigh Valley Transit Company (LVT) formed in 1905. It acquired the existing Lehigh Valley Traction Company, and the new owners started rebuilding of the existing trolley lines and acquisition of interurban cars. In 1912–13, and again in 1925, LVT upgraded track and rerouted lines by building private right of way between some towns (such as Quakertown to Souderton) where track had been at the side of rural roads and had made frequent 90 degree turns at road intersections causing slow operation. At Wales Junction on the original Chestnut Hill line, a totally new route was constructed northward to Lansdale and southward to Norristown, beyond which trolleys would run on the third rail Philadelphia and Western to the Philadelphia subway terminal at 69th Street in Upper Darby. This allowed LVT passengers to change to the Philadelphia transportation system. This Allentown to Norristown route was named the \"Liberty Bell Line\". The LVT's Allentown to Philadelphia division operating to 1951 is considered the last of the eastern U.S. single track, town street to side of road rural countryside hill and dale interurban trolleys in the United States, although the Springfield to Media end of the present day 100-year-old Upper Darby to Media former Red Arrow trolley line — now SEPTA Route 101 — has some of these same unique characteristics.All except the 430 and 1000 series cars could be, and often were, run together in two or three car trains, including combinations of both the 800 and newer 700 series cars. Across the years, equipment modifications were made by the Fairview Allentown shops. The 700 series steel cars were converted from center-entrance two-man crew to one-man cars. Coach 812 was a classic arch window large inter\n\n[3] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: Hatield and Lansdale: The house-like two story Hatfield former LVT station at Main Street is now the Trolley Station cafe. Inside this cafe there are photographs of LVT equipment and locations plus a 1938 weekend schedule. South of this building the former LVT right-of-way, including an original 1916 culvert, is now the Liberty Bell Trail for walking and biking. A right of way culvert and pole line are at Koffel Street close to the end of Squirrel Lane where the LVT entered Lansdale.\n\n[4] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: A typical daily run for an early morning LVT car operator began at Allentown's Fairview car barn and coach yard (now a park) where he picked up his assigned equipment, usually a lightweight 1000-series car, and took it eight residential blocks on a single track along Lehigh, Cumberland, Lumber, and St. John Streets to 8th Street where he switched onto the main line north, and ran over the 8th Street Bridge and then six blocks to the downtown Allentown station at 6th and Hamilton Sts. where he loaded any people waiting at the terminal. At the scheduled departure time, he began his trip to Norristown. About an hour and one half later, he reached Marshall siding in Norristown where a car exchange would occur with the P&W crew from 69th Street, and the LVT motorman began his return trip to Allentown. A motorman's normal day was two round trips. Obviously if there had been any delays with cars operating in either direction or the need for a defective car replacement (for example, at the Souderton carbarn by standby 1912 wood coach 812) his work day would be extended into overtime. An operator was required to wait until relieved. At the normal midday shift change, a motorman might pick up his car at 6th and Hamilton from the motorman arriving from Norristown, or an exchange could occur at 8th and St. John where the Allentown shop lead tied into the main line to 69th Street, Philadelphia.\n\n[5] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: In Norristown, its third-rail-equipped cars continued on the high-speed Philadelphia and Western Railroad to the 69th Street, Upper Darby terminus, which was the western terminus of the Philadelphia city subway-elevated. Philadelphia and Western Railroad crews operated the LVT cars from Norristown's Markley Street south. Much of the LVT's route was paralleled by the Reading Railroad's steam powered Bethlehem Branch and had many of the same stops. In Lansdale, the two stations faced each other. The Reading operated passenger service directly to its busy downtown Market Street Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, but the LVT was less expensive for frugal riders and made many more village, local, and roadside stops. Some patrons would ride the Reading, for example, from downtown Philadelphia to Lansdale, then walk across the street to the LVT station to catch the interurban home.\n\n[6] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: Before 1949, when LVT trolleys arrived at Norristown from Allentown, trolley poles were pulled down and secured, car power was switched from trolley to third rail, and the trip continued to 69th Street Terminal just outside Philadelphia (Upper Darby) over the high speed Philadelphia and Western Railroad. After 1949, when decreasing ridership and increasing costs forced a service cut-back to Norristown (only freight trolleys continued running to Upper Darby), LVT motormen had to run their passenger cars in reverse down from the Norristown elevated station, back to Markley and Airy Streets to a loop track known as Rink Siding. This required the motorman to go to the rear of the car and attach controls there. After looping at Rink, the motorman backed the car over the same four city blocks to return to the Norristown station where passengers would board for the next northbound trip. This was an awkward and unpleasant arrangement for the LVT and was indicative of its coming collapse.\n\n[7] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: LVT needed to maintain interurban cars, streetcars, freight trolleys, and line maintenance equipment such as the overhead wire car and the snow sweepers. LVT's primary car storage yard and major shop was the Fairview barn southwest of downtown Allentown. Tracks to Fairview left the main line just south of the 8th Street bridge on St. John Street, ran to Lumber Street, turned south on Lumber to Cumberland, then into the shop yard. To reach downtown from Fairview, LVT had the awkward situation of running interurban cars, sometimes backward, through residential areas along Lumber and St. John streets.\n\n[8] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: Direct current power for the interurban trolleys on the Liberty Bell Line was produced (from AC power supplied by overhead lines from Allentown) by rotary converters at substations in Allentown, Summit Lawn,Coopersburg, Quakertown, Sellersville, Souderton (in the carbarn), Lansdale, and Washington Square. Unlike the notation in the \"See Also\" section below, LVT never used mercury arc rectifiers.\n\n[9] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: In 1939, LVT purchased thirteen used lightweight high-speed Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad \"Red Devil\" cars from the abandoned Cincinnati to Toledo, Ohio, interurban to augment its older, heavier, and slower 700 and 800 series interurban cars. The former Red Devils were reconditioned by the innovative LVT Allentown shops and were then operated from Allentown to Philadelphia as Liberty Bell Limiteds. The LVT advertised for and ran freight, but it was a small part of the business. Like most interurbans, its primary income was from passenger service. Box motor freight trolleys usually operated at night, but LVT sometimes ran scheduled passenger trips as a \"mixed\" train with a freight box motor coupled behind the older 800 or 700 series of passenger coaches. The former C&LE Liberty Bell Limiteds were not built with couplers. During the World War II years, LVT carried full loads including standees on its overworked equipment. When the war ended, ridership rapidly declined, and LVT again faced bankruptcy and abandonment as it had during the Great Depression.\n\n[10] Lehigh Valley Transit Company: In 1905, the assets of the new Philadelphia and Lehigh Valley Traction Company were acquired by a new corporate entity: the Lehigh Valley Transit Company. The owners started an extensive rebuilding of the Allentown to Philadelphia route. Much side of road track (the line was always a single track) was replaced by track running in open country, however considerable older side-of-road trackage remained, particularly south of Quakertown. Heavy wood arch windowed interurban coaches were purchased for high speed operation. This upgrading program culminated in a high capacity interurban line running from Allentown to Norristown. It existed until 1951. Multiple car Interurbans operated from Allentown to Philadelphia's 69th Street terminal using the Philadelphia and Western Railroad south of Norristown starting in December 1912. Service on the former Inland Traction route running from North Wales (Junction) to Chestnut Hill continued until 1926, and the route between central Quakertown and Richlandtown ran until 1929, both replaced by bus. The LVT and P&W both reorganized during the next twenty years (LVT twice), but trolleys continued to operate and compete with the nearly paralleling Reading Railroad Bethlehem to Philadelphia line due to lower cost to riders, particularly during the Depression, and then again vitally during the gasoline rationing of World War II.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Like its predecessor, the Virgin VR-01, the MVR-02 was designed entirely with computational fluid dynamics, with Nick Wirth's design studio doubling their CFD capacity ahead of the 2011 season. The addition of the \"M\" in the car's chassis designation reflected the team's new owner, Russian sports car manufacturer Marussia Motors. The car was unveiled in London on 7 February 2011, and was driven during the racing season by returning driver Timo Glock and debutant Jérôme d'Ambrosio.\n\n[2] Virgin MVR-02: The MVR-02 followed the VR-01's design principle of exclusively using computational fluid dynamics instead of the more traditional windtunnel approach. The car did not use KERS; chief designer Nick Wirth commented that the gains offered by the system did not justify the expense in developing it. Instead, the team concentrated on improving the car's hydraulics and gearbox, both of which had been the frequent source of problems in 2010. After being forced to re-design the VR-01 when it was discovered the fuel tank was not large enough to finish races with a high fuel consumption, the MVR-02 was designed to be the same length as the original VR-01 chassis whilst retaining the full-size fuel tank. The air intake on the front of the nose was designed to resemble the one on Marussia's road car, the Marussia B2.\n\n[3] Virgin MVR-02: During the 2011 Spanish Grand Prix both cars had been upgraded and finish nineteenth and twentieth, with both drivers not complaining of any faults. At the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix the MVR-02 once again took the eleventh row on the grid. In the race, Glock suffered a suspension failure on lap 30. After the dramatic and unprecedented end of the race, d'Ambrosio finished fifteenth, bringing the MVR-02 to another classified finish.\n\n[4] Marussia MR01: Unlike its predecessors, the Virgin VR-01 and Virgin MVR-02, the Marussia MR01 was not designed exclusively with computational fluid dynamics (CFD); instead, the design team employed a combination of wind tunnel testing and CFD modelling in its design. Due to development delays, the team planned to launch the MR01 at the third and final pre-season test session at the Circuit de Catalunya on 1 March 2012, but as the car was unable to pass its mandatory crash tests prior to the final test session the team was not permitted to take part. According to technical advisor Pat Symonds, the car failed its crash tests because one part of the car was performing \"inconsistently\". The car was later launched on 5 March, following a shakedown at Silverstone Circuit, before passing its final mandatory crash test on 6 March.\n\n[5] Virgin MVR-02: In Germany the two cars qualified twentieth and twenty-second on the grid, with Glock ahead of d'Ambrosio. Glock commented to his engineers on the car-to-pit radio that they were making it \"difficult for him\" after this. Glock later tried to cover up his comments by saying they were meant in a joking way. Glock announced the following day that he would be staying with the team until 2014. The two cars finished the race in the same order, but in seventeenth and eighteenth places. The MVR-02s sandwiched the HRTs in Hungary, having qualified in twenty-first and last places. Glock finished the race of mixed weather conditions seventeenth and his teammate d'Ambrosio was nineteenth.\n\n[6] Virgin VR-01: The Virgin VR-01 was a Formula One motor racing car designed by Nick Wirth for Virgin Racing in the season. It was driven by former Toyota driver Timo Glock and Brazilian ex-GP2 driver Lucas di Grassi. The car was the first Formula One racing car designed entirely with computational fluid dynamics. The car was due to be launched online through the official team website on 3 February 2010, but technical issues prevented the live internet broadcast from taking place.\n\n[7] Virgin MVR-02: The car was not expected to do well in the power circuit of Spa. The cars were twentieth and twenty-first, with d'Ambrosio outside the 107% rule for his home race. He was allowed to race, however, because it had been a mixed weather qualifying. With no such weather in the race he brought the car home in seventeenth, one place above Glock. Despite outqualifying and out-racing HRT, the at Monza was quite disappointing for the MVR-02. Qualifying on the second-back row, d'Ambrosio suffered a gearbox failure on lap 1, and although Glock managed one of the team's best results of the year with a fifteenth-place finish, this was last place. It was the same Q1 result in Singapore, although Glock crashed out on lap nine whilst d'Ambrosio finished eighteenth. The Virgin cars took positions 20 and 21 in both qualifying and the race in Japan. They beat the HRTs and Nico Rosberg's Mercedes, that had suffered hydraulics failure, in Qualifying, before again beating the HRTs and benefiting from the retirement of Sébastien Buemi in the race. At the , Glock and D'Ambrosio qualified twenty-first and twenty-second before finishing twentieth and twenty-second.\n\n[8] Virgin MVR-02: At the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix the MVR-02s showed enough pace to finish fourteenth and fifteenth. At the following race, the 2011 European Grand Prix, the Marrusia Virgin team complained that diffuser rules appeared to have hampered their chances of being competitive. Glock and d'Ambrosio qualified 21st and 23rd for the race. Then came the British Grand Prix, which was the first race with full diffuser bans. The track conditions were in between dry and damp, conditions that had hampered the team in Australia. Glock finished in sixteenth and d'Ambrosio was seventeenth.\n\n[9] Nick Wirth: Wirth also designed Virgin's second F1 car, the MVR-02, but its performance proved to be disappointing as it failed to close the gap to the leaders relative to the VR-01. In June 2011, Virgin announced that it had parted company with Wirth and abandoned its policy of only using CFD.\n\n[10] Virgin MVR-02: In June 2011 that Marussia Virgin Racing announced that they had ended their relationship with technical partner Nick Wirth and his company, Wirth Research, who designed their 2010 and 2011 cars. The reason cited was a disappointing start to their 2011 season.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHow many sides has a pentacontagon?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Pentacontagon: The \"regular pentacontagon\" has Dih dihedral symmetry, order 100, represented by 50 lines of reflection. Dih has 5 dihedral subgroups: Dih, (Dih, Dih), and (Dih, Dih). It also has 6 more cyclic symmetries as subgroups: (Z, Z), (Z, Z), and (Z, Z), with Z representing π/\"n\" radian rotational symmetry.\n\n[2] Pentacontagon: In geometry, a pentacontagon or pentecontagon or 50-gon is a fifty-sided polygon. The sum of any pentacontagon's interior angles is 8640 degrees.\n\n[3] Pentacontagon: A pentacontagram is a 50-sided star polygon. There are 9 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {50/3}, {50/7}, {50/9}, {50/11}, {50/13}, {50/17}, {50/19}, {50/21}, and {50/23}, as well as 16 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration.\n\n[4] Pentacontagon: Coxeter states that every zonogon (a 2\"m\"-gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into \"m\"(\"m\"-1)/2 parallelograms. In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the \"regular pentacontagon\", \"m\"=25, it can be divided into 300: 12 sets of 25 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 25-cube.\n\n[5] Pentagonal hexecontahedron: In geometry, a pentagonal hexecontahedron is a Catalan solid, dual of the snub dodecahedron. It has two distinct forms, which are mirror images (or \"enantiomorphs\") of each other. It has 92 vertices that span 60 pentagonal faces. It is the Catalan solid with the most vertices. Among the Catalan and Archimedean solids, it has the second largest number of vertices, after the truncated icosidodecahedron, which has 120 vertices.\n\n[6] Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron: For example, the small stellated dodecahedron has 12 pentagram faces with the central pentagonal part hidden inside the solid. The visible parts of each face comprise five isosceles triangles which touch at five points around the pentagon. We could treat these triangles as 60 separate faces to obtain a new, irregular polyhedron which looks outwardly identical. Each edge would now be divided into three shorter edges (of two different kinds), and the 20 false vertices would become true ones, so that we have a total of 32 vertices (again of two kinds). The hidden inner pentagons are no longer part of the polyhedral surface, and can disappear. Now Euler's formula holds: 60 − 90 + 32 = 2. However this polyhedron is no longer the one described by the Schläfli symbol {5/2, 5}, and so can not be a Kepler–Poinsot solid even though it still looks like one from outside.\n\n[7] Pentagon: An equilateral pentagon is a polygon with five sides of equal length. However, its five internal angles can take a range of sets of values, thus permitting it to form a family of pentagons. In contrast, the regular pentagon is unique up to similarity, because it is equilateral and, moreover, it is equiangular (its five angles are equal).\n\n[8] Pentagon: There are no combinations of regular polygons with 4 or more meeting at a vertex that contain a pentagon. For combinations with 3, if 3 polygons meet at a vertex and one has an odd number of sides, the other 2 must be congruent. The reason for this is that the polygons that touch the edges of the pentagon must alternate around the pentagon, which is impossible because of the pentagon's odd number of sides. For the pentagon, this results in a polygon whose angles are all . To find the number of sides this polygon has, the result is , which is not a whole number. Therefore, a pentagon cannot appear in any tiling made by regular polygons.\n\n[9] Regular dodecahedron: A regular dodecahedron or pentagonal dodecahedron is a dodecahedron that is regular, which is composed of twelve regular pentagonal faces, three meeting at each vertex. It is one of the five Platonic solids. It has 12 faces, 20 vertices, 30 edges, and 160 diagonals (60 face diagonals, 100 space diagonals). It is represented by the Schläfli symbol {5,3}.\n\n[10] Pentagrammic cuploid: As 5/2 > 2, the triangles and squares do not fully cover the bottom of the pentagrammic cuploid, and hence the centre of the pentagrammic base is accessible from both sides and covers no space. Hence it is a membrane and has not been filled in in the above illustration of the polyhedron, as filling it in would imply that the densities on either of the pentagram are different, when they are both 0. It has been conjectured that a polyhedron with 10 faces or less cannot have a membrane: the pentagrammic cuploid has 11 faces.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the purpose of replay review?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Replay review: A replay review is a form of user-generated content. In most instances, a replay review is a review of an RTS video game game replay of a lesser player by a more experience, talented player. Replay reviews are used to increase the skill of the original player, but are often also read or watched for entertainment. These reviews are done in a multitude of ways. Some replays are written, usually by talented players who can pick out errors made by the original player. Other replay reviews, often called shoutcasts, are spoken reviews, meant to be manually synced with the actual game replay so players can listen to a commentary while watching the game.\n\n[2] Game replay: Replays are the driving force behind replay reviews. A replay review can be loosely defined as a review of a game replay by an experienced player to determine what can be done to improve and expand upon the initial gamer's skill. Entire websites are dedicated to these reviews, such as Gamereplays.org.\n\n[3] Replay review in gridiron football: Replay reviews are utilized in some Texas high school games, and also for many games at the college level and above. The National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) establishes the rules for most high school and youth organizations in the United States (though not for Texas high schools), and the rules of the NFHS do not permit replay reviews even when the equipment exists to enable the practice. In those leagues that utilize replay reviews, there are restrictions on what types of plays can be reviewed. In general, most penalty calls or lack thereof cannot be reviewed, nor can a play that is whistled dead by the officials before the play could come to its rightful end.\n\n[4] Replay review: Replay reviews are often used in games such as \"Company of Heroes\" \"\" \"Battle for Middle Earth 2\", \"Supreme Commander\", and \"Age of Empires 3\". Most premier RTS titles with active communities have replay reviews at their cores. Some online websites revolve around these reviews, such as Gamereplays and HeavenGames.\n\n[5] Replay review in gridiron football: Another dramatic difference between CFL and NFL replay rules is that the CFL allows replay review of certain judgment calls. Since 2014, defensive pass interference situations have been reviewable, with replay officials authorized to overturn called fouls even if the pass had not been touched before the foul, and also to impose fouls that were not called on the field. Notably, the Edmonton Eskimos scored what proved to be the game-winning touchdown in the 2015 Grey Cup after they had successfully challenged an incompletion during the scoring drive on the grounds of a missed pass interference call. The CFL added several other penalties, among them offensive pass interference, illegal contact, and roughing the kicker or passer, to its list of reviewable calls in 2016. These penalties can only be reviewed if challenged by a coach—replay officials have no authority to review penalties during automatic review situations, or after the three-minute warning in the fourth quarter.\n\n[6] Instant replay: Instant replay or action replay is a video reproduction of something that recently occurred which was both shot and broadcast live. The video, having already been shown live, is replayed in order for viewers to see again and analyze what had just taken place. Some sports allow officiating calls to be overturned after the review of a play. Instant replay is most commonly used in sports, but is also used in other fields of live TV. While the first near-instant replay system was developed and used in Canada, the first \"instant\" replay was developed and deployed in the United States.\n\n[7] Instant replay: In American and Canadian football, instant replay can take place in the event of a close or otherwise controversial call, either at the request of a team's head coach (with limitations) or the officials themselves. There are restrictions on what types of plays can be reviewed. In general, most penalty calls or lack thereof cannot be reviewed, nor can a play that is whistled dead by the officials before the play could come to its rightful end.\n\n[8] Replay review in gridiron football: College football instant replay was started by the Big Ten Conference in the 2004 season because of what happened in the 2002 Penn State vs. Michigan football game when reviews were used experimentally in the Big Ten Conference only. In the 2005 season, all conferences were allowed to use instant replay. Among Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (see Division I-A) conferences, the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East (since succeeded in football by the American Athletic Conference), Big Ten, Big 12, Conference USA, MAC, Mountain West Conference, Pac-10, and SEC used replay in 2005. The Sun Belt and Western Athletic (the latter of which no longer sponsors football) did not.\n\n[9] Three-point field goal: An official raises his/her arm with three fingers extended to signal the shot attempt. If the attempt is successful, he/she raises his/her other arm with all fingers fully extended in manner similar to a football official signifying successful field goal to indicate the three-point goal. The official must recognize it for it to count as three points. Instant replay has sometimes been used, depending on league rules. The NBA, WNBA, FIBA and the NCAA specifically allow replay for this purpose. In NBA, FIBA, and WNBA games, video replay does not have to occur immediately following a shot; play can continue and the officials can adjust the scoring later in the game, after reviewing the video. However, in late game situations, play may be paused pending a review.\n\n[10] Replay review in gridiron football: In Texas, the governing body for public-school sports, the University Interscholastic League (UIL), allows replay only in televised state championship games, and only if approved beforehand by the UIL. The UIL's list of reviewable plays is identical that of the NCAA. However, the UIL's rule differs in that coaches cannot challenge calls, replay officials canot create targeting fouls that were not called on the field, there is no 10-second clock runoff for a replay reversal that did not stop the clock, and the UIL does not provide for collaborative replay experiments. By contrast, the main governing body for non-public schools, the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools, follows the NFHS in banning replay review.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Laser light is usually spatially coherent, which means that the light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Lasers are used to read compact discs and bar codes, guide missiles, remove ulcers, fabricate steel, precisely measure the distance from Earth to the Moon, record ultradefined images of brain tissue, entertain people in light shows and do thousands of other things. In 1957, American physicist Gordon Gould first theorized the idea and use of laser technology. Despite a 20-year battle with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Gould is now widely associated as the original inventor of laser. In addition, Charles H. Townes and Arthur L. Schawlow, scientists at Bell Laboratories, wrote a paper, \"Infrared and Optical Masers\" in 1958 that was enormously influential on the theory of lasers. Ironically, Gould, Townes, or Schawlow never built the first working laser. On July 7, 1960, American physicist Theodore H. Maiman created and built the first laser. The core of his laser consisted of a man-made ruby as the active medium, a material that had been judged unsuitable by other scientists who rejected crystal cores in favor of various gases.\n\n[2] Laser: A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \"laser\" originated as an acronym for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow.\n\n[3] Laser: On May 16, 1960, Theodore H. Maiman operated the first functioning laser at Hughes Research Laboratories, Malibu, California, ahead of several research teams, including those of Townes, at Columbia University, Arthur Schawlow, at Bell Labs, and Gould, at the TRG (Technical Research Group) company. Maiman's functional laser used a solid-state flashlamp-pumped synthetic ruby crystal to produce red laser light, at 694 nanometers wavelength; however, the device only was capable of pulsed operation, because of its three-level pumping design scheme. Later that year, the Iranian physicist Ali Javan, and William R. Bennett, and Donald Herriott, constructed the first gas laser, using helium and neon that was capable of continuous operation in the infrared (U.S. Patent 3,149,290); later, Javan received the Albert Einstein Award in 1993. Basov and Javan proposed the semiconductor laser diode concept. In 1962, Robert N. Hall demonstrated the first \"laser diode\" device, which was made of gallium arsenide and emitted in the near-infrared band of the spectrum at 850 nm. Later that year, Nick Holonyak, Jr. demonstrated the first semiconductor laser with a visible emission. This first semiconductor laser could only be used in pulsed-beam operation, and when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K). In 1970, Zhores Alferov, in the USSR, and Izuo Hayashi and Morton Panish of Bell Telephone Laboratories also independently developed room-temperature, continual-operation diode lasers, using the heterojunction structure.\n\n[4] Theodore Harold Maiman: Theodore Harold \"Ted\" Maiman (July 11, 1927 – May 5, 2007) was an American engineer and physicist who was widely, but not universally, credited with the invention of the laser (Others attribute the invention to Gordon Gould). Maiman's laser led to the subsequent development of many other types of lasers. The laser was successfully fired on May 16, 1960. In a July 7, 1960 press conference in Manhattan, Maiman and his employer, Hughes Aircraft Company, announced the laser to the world. Maiman was granted a patent for his invention, and he received many awards and honors for his work. Maiman's experiences in developing the first laser and subsequent related events are described in his book, \"The Laser Odyssey\".\n\n[5] Ring laser: Shortly after the discovery of the laser, a seminal paper by Rosenthal appeared in 1962, which proposed what was later called a ring laser. While the ring laser shares with regular (linear) lasers features like extreme monochromaticity and high directivity, it differs in its inclusion of an area. With the ring laser, one could distinguish two beams in opposite directions. Rosenthal anticipated that the beam frequencies could be split by effects that affected the two beams in different ways. Although some may consider Macek et al. has built the first large ring laser (1 meter × 1 meter). The US patent office has decided the first ring laser was built under Sperry scientist, Chao Chen Wang, (see US Patent 3,382,758) based on the Sperry laboratory records. Wang showed that simply rotating it could generate a difference in the frequencies of the two beams (Sagnac). An industry focusing on smaller ring laser gyros emerged, with decimeter-sized ring lasers. Later it was found that any effect that affects the two beams in nonreciprocal fashion produces a frequency difference, as Rosenthal anticipated. Tools to analyze and construct rings were adapted from regular lasers, including methods to calculate the signal-to-noise ratio and to analyze beam characteristics. New phenomena unique to rings appeared, including lock-in, pulling, astigmatic beams, and special polarizations. Mirrors play a much greater role in ring lasers than in linear lasers, leading to the development of particularly high quality mirrors.\n\n[6] Dmitri Z. Garbuzov: The 1970 demonstration of the first room-temperature diode laser crowned years of scientific and technological research developments involving optical semiconductors. These accomplishments parallel, but lag, the microelectronics revolution that started with the transistor, first demonstrated in 1947 (leading to the displacement of vacuum tube electronics in the marketplace). Although the laser had already been invented by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow, separately by Gordon Gould, and separately in the Soviet Union by Aleksandr Prokhorov, there was no practical laser \"chip\" which would make the laser a commodity, one that today is displacing more inefficient lasers (those based on gas discharge or flashlamp designs) in the consumer, industrial, medical, and government marketplaces.\n\n[7] Laboratory for Laser Energetics: The LLE was founded on the University of Rochester's campus in 1970, by Dr. Moshe Lubin. Working with outside companies such as Kodak the team built Delta, a four beam laser system in 1972. Construction started on the current LLE site in 1976. The facility opened a six beam laser system in 1978 and followed with a 24 beam system two years later. In 2018, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou shared a Nobel prize for work they had undertaken in 1985 while at LLE. They invented a method to amplify laser pulses by \"chirping\" for which they would share the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics. This method disperses a short, broadband pulse of laser light into a temporally longer spectrum of wavelengths. The system amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color. Chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the National Ignition Facility and the Omega EP system. In 1995, the omega laser system was increased to 60 beams, and in 2008 the Omega extended performance system was opened.\n\n[8] Chemical laser: TRW also produced a cylindrical chemical laser (the Alpha laser) for DARPA, which had the theoretical advantage of being scalable to even larger powers. However, by 1990, the interest in chemical lasers had shifted toward shorter wavelengths, and the chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) gained the most interest, producing radiation at 1.315 μm. There is a further advantage that the COIL laser generally produces single wavelength radiation, which is very helpful for forming a very well focused beam. This type of COIL laser is used today in the ABL (Airborne Laser, the laser itself being built by Northrop Grumman) and in the ATL (Advanced Tactical Laser) produced by Boeing. Meanwhile, a lower power HF laser was used for the THEL (Tactical High Energy Laser) built in the late 1990s for the Israeli Ministry of Defense in cooperation with the U.S. Army SMDC. It holds the distinction of being the first fielded high energy laser to demonstrate effectiveness in fairly realistic tests against rockets and artillery. The MIRACL laser has demonstrated effectiveness against certain targets flown in front of it at White Sands Missile Range, but it is not configured for actual service as a fielded weapon. ABL was successful in shooting down several full sized missiles from significant ranges, and ATL was successful in disabling moving land vehicles and other tactical targets.\n\n[9] Laser science: The theoretical principles describing the operation of a microwave laser (a maser) were first described by Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov at the \"All-Union Conference on Radio Spectroscopy\" in May 1952. The first maser was built by Charles H. Townes, James P. Gordon, and H. J. Zeiger in 1953. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 for their research in the field of stimulated emission. Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou, and Donna Strickland were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics.\n\n[10] Timeline of United States inventions (1946–1991): A gas laser is a laser in which an electric current is discharged through a gas to produce light. The first gas laser, the Helium-neon, was invented by William R. Bennett, Don Herriott, and Ali Javan in 1960. The first continuous visible gas laser, operating at 632.8 nm in the red, was invented by A. D. White and J. D. Rigden in 1962.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

A two-part Christmas special was also made and aired on 26 and 27 December 2003. There are 14 episodes in total. Although series 1 and 2 were originally broadcast on BBC Two, the Christmas episodes were moved to BBC One to increase viewership following the previous series' popularity. Both series, as well as the Christmas specials, have been released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. The programme has won numerous awards, including two British Comedy Awards and two Golden Globe. \"The Office\" has also been remade in several different countries, with its American adaptation being the most popular and longest-running.\n\n[2] The Men from the Ministry: The Men from the Ministry is a British radio comedy series broadcast by the BBC between 1962 and 1977, starring Wilfrid Hyde-White, Richard Murdoch and, from 1966, when he replaced Hyde-White, Deryck Guyler. Written and produced by Edward Taylor with contributions from John Graham, and with some early episodes written by Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, it ran for 13 series, totalling 145 half-hour episodes and two specials. A further 14 episodes were made by the BBC Transcription Service in 1980 but never broadcast in the UK, until 2012 on BBC Radio 4 Extra. Versions were made by Yle in Finland, Sveriges Radio (SR) in Sweden, and Springbok Radio in South Africa, where it was made into a feature-length film.\n\n[3] List of The Office (U.S. TV series) episodes: \"The Office\" aired a short first season in 2005 that consisted of six episodes. This was followed by a full-length second season in 2005–06 that consisted of 22 episodes, and a third season in 2006–07, with 25 episodes. Due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, the fourth season that aired in 2007–08 consisted of 19 episodes. The fifth season aired during 2008–09 and consisted of 28 episodes. The sixth season aired during 2009–10 and consisted of 26 episodes. The seventh season aired during 2010–11 and consisted of 26 episodes. The eighth season aired during 2011–12 and consisted of 24 episodes. The ninth season aired during 2012–13 and consisted of 25 episodes. A total of 201 episodes of \"The Office\" aired over nine seasons.\n\n[4] List of The Saint episodes: Production blocks: (1) series one 26 episodes, (2) series two 13 episodes. (3) The next 32 episodes were made as series two and the 39 previous episodes were re-branded as series one for worldwide distribution. (4) 30 episodes plus the feature film version of \"The Fiction Makers\". (5) 13 episodes plus the feature film version of 'Vendetta for the Saint'. \"The Fiction Makers\" was shot by director Roy Ward Baker in a dual format, principally as a feature for European Cinema distribution, and as a television two-parter scripted to include a scene to begin part two with the usual \"The Saint\" halo sequence (the film and TV versions are edited differently also). The film version was given a U certificate by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) on 29 September 1966. \"Vendetta for the Saint\" was made without provision for a TV edit and has no special halo sequence for part two; also part two has the film version's 'end' caption. The 71 b/w episodes were originally divided into four series in the UK and the colour episodes were series 5 and 6. The colour episodes were originally broadcast in the UK in black and white, predating the advent of colour TV transmissions on ITV.\n\n[5] List of The Office (U.S. TV series) episodes: Season one aired between March 24 and April 26, 2005. It originally debuted as a midseason replacement for \"Committed\". It carried over general plot ideas from the earlier British series created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, and particularly the threat of wholesale downsizing. However, only the pilot was a direct adaptation of one of the UK version's episodes.\n\n[6] The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer: \"The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer\" DVD (Region 2, UK), which contains both series' was released by 2 Entertain/Cinema Club on 3 April 2006.  When the first series of the programme first made it to video titled \"Red\" & \"Blue\", it included extended versions of the episodes the way they were supposed to go out on TV, usually 7–10 minutes of new footage. When this DVD came out many were disappointed to find the episodes featured were the BBC edit versions. Series 2 was intact on the DVD release, mainly because it never had extended versions.\n\n[7] List of The Office (U.S. TV series) episodes: Season two of \"The Office\" premiered on September 20, 2005, and ended on May 11, 2006. NBC initially ordered only six episodes for the season, and in September, ordered seven more. On November 3, 2005, NBC ordered an additional three, and in the end it had ordered a full season of 22 episodes. Season two featured the first \"super-sized\" 40-minute episode of \"The Office\".\n\n[8] Finale (The Office): The initial idea for the finale, involving the Q&A, was thought of by Daniels during production of the third season. The episode features the return of many recurring characters, as well as Carell, whose return was kept secret for many months. Many members of the show's crew—such as episode writer Daniels—made cameos in the episode as various background characters. Jennie Tan, the founder of the largest \"Office\" fansite OfficeTally appears in the episode as a fictional version of herself asking the members of the office questions.\n\n[9] The Office (U.S. TV series): Episodes from \"The Office\" were among the first shows available for download from the iTunes Store beginning in December 2005. In 2006, ten internet-exclusive webisodes featuring some of the characters on \"The Office\" aired on NBC.com. \"Producer's Cuts\" (containing approximately ten additional minutes of material) of the episodes \"Branch Closing\" and \"The Return\" were also made available on NBC.com. \"The Office\" also became available for download from Amazon.com's Unbox video downloads in 2006. Sales of new \"The Office\" episodes on iTunes ceased in 2007 due to a dispute between NBC and Apple ostensibly over pricing. As of September 9, 2008 \"The Office\" was put back on the iTunes Store, and can be bought in HD and Regular format. Netflix also offers the show for online viewing by subscribers, in addition to traditional DVD rental. \"The Office\" is also available on Microsoft's Zune Marketplace. On December 13, 2017, Comedy Central announced that they had acquired all nine seasons of the show from NBCUniversal in a non-exclusive deal, and some episodes will be made available to stream on Comedy Central's official website and mobile app after January 15, 2018.\n\n[10] The Office (U.S. season 3): The third season of the American television comedy \"The Office\" premiered in the United States on NBC on September 21, 2006, and concluded on May 17, 2007. The season had a total of 25 half-hours of material, divided into 16 half-hour episodes, five 40-minute \"super-sized\" episodes, and two one-hour episodes. \"The Office\" is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name as a mockumentary portraying the daily lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

His tombstone is inscribed \"Selman Abraham Waksman: Scientist\", with his dates of birth and death, and the phrase \"The earth will open and bring forth salvation\" in Hebrew and English, from .\n\n[2] Selman Waksman: Selman Abraham Waksman (July 22, 1888 – August 16, 1973) was a Ukrainian-born, Jewish-American inventor, biochemist and microbiologist whose research into the decomposition of organisms that live in soil enabled the discovery of streptomycin and several other antibiotics. A professor of biochemistry and microbiology at Rutgers University for four decades, he discovered a number of antibiotics (and introduced the modern sense of that word to name them), and he introduced procedures that have led to the development of many others. The proceeds earned from the licensing of his patents funded a foundation for microbiological research, which established the Waksman Institute of Microbiology located on Rutgers University's Busch Campus in Piscataway, New Jersey (USA). In 1952, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for \"ingenious, systematic and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of streptomycin.\" Waksman was later successfully sued for minimizing the role of Albert Schatz, a PhD student who worked under Waksman's supervision to discover streptomycin.\n\n[3] Selman Waksman: Selman Waksman was born on July 22, 1888, to Jewish parents, in Nova Pryluka, Podolia Governorate, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. He was the son of Fradia (London) and Jacob Waksman. He immigrated to the United States in 1910, shortly after receiving his diploma from the Fifth Gymnasium in Odessa, and became a naturalized American citizen six years later.\n\n[4] Selman Waksman: Waksman attended Rutgers College (now Rutgers University), where he graduated in 1915 with a bachelor of science in agriculture. He continued his studies at Rutgers, receiving a master of science the following year. During his graduate study, he worked under J. G. Lipman at the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers performing research in soil bacteriology. Waksman spent some months in 1915-1916 at the United States Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC under Dr Charles Thom, studying soil fungi. He was then appointed as research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was awarded his doctor of philosophy in biochemistry in 1918.\n\n[5] Selman Waksman: In 1951, using half of his personal patent royalties, Waksman created the Waksman Foundation for Microbiology. At a meeting of the board of trustees of the foundation, held in July 1951, he urged the building of a facility for work in microbiology, named the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, which is located on the Busch Campus of Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. First president of the foundation, Waksman was succeeded in this position by his son, Byron H. Waksman, from 1970 to 2000.\n\n[6] Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology: The Selman A. Waksman Award in Microbiology is awarded by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences \"in recognition of excellence in the field of microbiology.\" Named after Selman Waksman, it was first awarded in 1968. A $5000 prize is included in the honor.\n\n[7] Pharmaceutical industry: The aftermath of World War II saw an explosion in the discovery of new classes of antibacterial drugs including the cephalosporins (developed by Eli Lilly based on the seminal work of Giuseppe Brotzu and Edward Abraham), streptomycin (discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory), the tetracyclines (discovered at Lederle Laboratories, now a part of Pfizer), erythromycin (discovered at Eli Lilly and Co.) and their extension to an increasingly wide range of bacterial pathogens. Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis. At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were an ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.\n\n[8] Selman Waksman: In 2005, Selman Waksman was granted an ACS National Historical Chemical Landmark in recognition of the significant work of his lab in isolating more than 15 antibiotics, including streptomycin, which was the first effective treatment for tuberculosis.\n\n[9] Streptomycin: Streptomycin was first isolated on October 19, 1943, by Albert Schatz, a PhD student in the laboratory of Selman Abraham Waksman at Rutgers University in a research project funded by Merck and Co. Waksman and his laboratory staff discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, and candidin. Of these, streptomycin and neomycin found extensive application in the treatment of numerous infectious diseases. Streptomycin was the first antibiotic cure for tuberculosis (TB). In 1952 Waksman was the recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in recognition \"for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic active against tuberculosis\". Waksman was later accused of playing down the role of Schatz who did the work under his supervision.\n\n[10] Selman Waksman: The Selman A.

Stetson discovered the Rhesus blood group system, which was found to be the cause of the majority of transfusion reactions up to that time. Three years later, the introduction by J.F. Loutit and Patrick L. Mollison of acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) solution, which reduced the volume of anticoagulant, permitted transfusions of greater volumes of blood and allowed longer term storage.\n\n[2] Blood transfusion: Another important breakthrough came in 1939–40 when Karl Landsteiner, Alex Wiener, Philip Levine, and R.E. Stetson discovered the Rhesus blood group system, which was found to be the cause of the majority of transfusion reactions up to that time. Three years later, the introduction by J.F. Loutit and Patrick L. Mollison of acid–citrate–dextrose (ACD) solution, which reduced the volume of anticoagulant, permitted transfusions of greater volumes of blood and allowed longer term storage.\n\n[3] Karl Landsteiner: Karl Landsteiner, , (14 June 1868 – 26 June 1943) was an Austrian biologist, physician, and immunologist. He distinguished the main blood groups in 1900, having developed the modern system of classification of blood groups from his identification of the presence of agglutinins in the blood, and identified, with Alexander S. Wiener, the Rhesus factor, in 1937, thus enabling physicians to transfuse blood without endangering the patient's life. With Constantin Levaditi and Erwin Popper, he discovered the polio virus in 1909. He received the Aronson Prize in 1926. In 1930, he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He was posthumously awarded the Lasker Award in 1946, and has been described as the father of transfusion medicine.\n\n[4] Zhang Tingdong: Zhang Tingdong (; born in November 8, 1932) is a Chinese medical scientist, pharmaceutical chemist, and educator in Harbin Medical University, 1st affiliated Hospital, and is best known for discovering of using arsenic trioxide to treat leukemia, which was regarded as a significant breakthrough of anti-leukemia medicine in the 20th Century and improvement for the lives of people with leukemia.\n\n[5] Kurt Hellmann: From 1962 until 1987, Hellmann served the Imperial Cancer Research Fund London as founding director of its Department of Cancer Chemotherapy. In 1972, Hellmann published the results of his breakthrough work with DL-razoxane (ICRF-159), the first fully antimetastatic compound discovered for the treatment of cancer. He was the co-founder and long-term editor (1974-1991) of the journal \"Cancer Treatment Reviews.\" In 1974, he co-created with Silvio Garattini, the Director of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Milan, an international body of medical experts called the E.O.R.T.C. Metastasis Club, which evolved in the 1980s into the Metastasis Research Society. He co-edited the organization's official journal, \"Clinical &Experimental Metastasis\" from 1984 to 1998. In 1977, he released with co-authors Stephen Carter and Marie Bakowski the oncology standard reference \"Chemotherapy of Cancer.\" In 1996, he predicted the importance of preventing pharmacological anthracycline cardiotoxicity in quality of life of cancer survivors.\n\n[6] List of Neighbours characters (2007): Charlotte learns that Terrence slept with Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) and she worries that he is going to ruin their plans. Sky discovers that Terrence is a con man and she hits him with a sugar dispenser, which knocks him out. Charlotte finds him and when he starts to come to, he tells her that he is going to the police. Charlotte hits Terrence again and kills him. She later learns that Sky has been arrested for his murder. Rosetta Cammeniti (Natalie Saleeba) is worried about Carmella and threatens to report Charlotte to the medical board. Charlotte kisses Boyd and he invites her to a dinner party. Charlotte struggles to answer Karl Kennedy's (Alan Fletcher) questions and Karl begins to think she is a fake. Karl notices Charlotte's medical certificates and a paperweight, which reminds him of a friend. Karl finds out that his friend's paperweight was stolen and everyone realises that Charlotte is a fake. Boyd also discovers the truth and decides to run away with Charlotte, so he can get the truth about Terrence's death out of her. Charlotte confesses all to Boyd, who records it on his MP3 player. Charlotte crashes the car and they are taken to the hospital, where Boyd tells the police about her confession. Charlotte is then sent to prison.\n\n[7] Supernova (2000 film): It is ultimately discovered that the young man who called for rescue is actually Karl Larson, an old former lover of Kaela (it is implied they had an abusive relationship). Karl came into contact with the nine-dimensional matter after recovering the artifact. It somehow enabled him to acquire super-strength and supernatural healing abilities, and made him younger (such that Kaela did not recognize him). Karl murders most of the crew except Kaela and strands Nick on the mining platform. Karl unsuccessfully attempts to romantically reconcile with Kaela. Nick finds his way back to the medical ship through a rescue pod left on the mining platform, and a battle ensues between Nick and Karl. Karl is ultimately killed by Kaela using explosives placed near the alien artifact which Karl was obsessed with retrieving. The explosion ejects the artifact into space, hurtling it towards the blue giant.\n\n[8] Karl Sell: Sell established the first school of chirotherapy in Neutrauchburg near Isny in 1953. Chirotherapy as practised by Sell was partly based on his experience as a military surgeon and on established practices within chiropractic and osteopathy. It is distinguished from chiropractic and osteopathy by being part of rational-critical scientific medicine. His work resulted in the recognition of chirotherapy as a medical specialty by the German Medical Association in 1976. The original school in Neutrauchburg is now named the Karl Sell Medical Seminary (Ärtzteseminar Dr. Karl Sell).\n\n[9] Paul Uhlenhuth: He is famous in the annals of forensic science for developing the species precipitin test, known as the Uhlenhuth test, which could distinguish human blood from animal blood in 1901, a discovery which had tremendous importance in criminal justice in the 20th century. In 1915, he discovered the pathogen of Weil's disease. He also invented the arsenic treatment of syphilis and the antimony treatment of many tropical diseases, and was an influential promoter of cancer research. He was a recipient of numerous honours, and was a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine 40 times between 1910 and 1952, notably by Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner. At the time of his death, he was one of the most celebrated medical researchers in Germany, and one of the rare examples of someone who was equally celebrated in the west and east during the Cold War.\n\n[10] Karl Kennedy: Izzy and Holly return to Erinsborough. Izzy informs the Kennedys that she has inherited £41 million from her late husband. She offers to invest in the building of a new hospital wing, as long as Karl receives the naming rights. Izzy soon tells Karl that the real reason she has returned is to ask him to father another child with her. Karl initially considers the offer, which puts a strain on his marriage, but ultimately declines. Izzy then steals his sperm sample from the hospital to impregnate herself. Karl asks Izzy to take a pregnancy test, which is negative. Izzy then admits that she actually wanted Karl back, as she felt happier with him. She leaves Erinsborough without Holly, who stays with Karl and Susan before leaving for a school exchange trip. Karl is tasked with analysing the some test results from a medical trial and discovers participant 18D has a blood clot. Karl soon learns he is 18D and he is diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and put on blood-thinners. After he accidentally cuts his finger, Karl rushes to the hospital and he tells Susan about his condition. Karl tries to raise finds for his new MRI screening project, despite Clive Gibbons (Geoff Paine), the hospital's COO, telling him it will likely fail. Karl's project receives interest from Rita Newland (Lisa Kay), who offers to fund it for a year.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

At the time, the testing was limited to a \"small number of users in Australia and Thailand\", with the ad format being swipe-based carousel ads. In July, the company announced that they were expanding the testing to a global audience. Stan Chudnovsky, head of Messenger, told \"VentureBeat\" that \"We’ll start slow ... When the average user can be sure to see them we truly don’t know because we’re just going to be very data-driven and user feedback-driven on making that decision\". Facebook told \"TechCrunch\" that the advertisements' placement in the inbox depends on factors such as thread count, phone screen size, and pixel density. In a \"TechCrunch\" editorial by Devin Coldewey, he described the ads as \"huge\" in the space they occupy, \"intolerable\" in the way they appear in the user interface, and \"irrelevant\" due to the lack of context. Coldewey finished by writing \"Advertising is how things get paid for on the internet, including TechCrunch, so I’m not an advocate of eliminating it or blocking it altogether. But bad advertising experiences can spoil a perfectly good app like (for the purposes of argument) Messenger. Messaging is a personal, purposeful use case and these ads are a bad way to monetize it.\"\n\n[2] Facebook: On pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49% for Wall posts. A study found that, for video advertisements on Facebook, over 40% of users who viewed the videos viewed the entire video, while the industry average was 25% for in-banner video ads. The company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US$2.59 billion were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US$7.87 billion were made for the entirety of 2013; and Facebook's annual profit for 2013 was US$1.5 billion. During the same time, independent market research firm eMarketer released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global digital ad revenues in 2013 (Google's share was 32.4 per cent). Revenue for the June 2014 quarter rose to $2.68 billion, an increase of 67 per cent over the second quarter of 2013. Mobile advertising revenue accounted for around 62 per cent of advertising revenue, an increase of approximately 41 per cent over the comparable quarter of the previous year. In December 2017, the company announced that it would no longer route all of its revenues through its Ireland headquarters, but rather record revenue locally in each of the countries where it is generated. Later Facebook received a charge of $1.63 billion by European Union for the data breach.\n\n[3] Facebook: Facebook ranked No. 76 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Most of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising. Facebook generally has a lower clickthrough rate (CTR) for advertisements than most major websites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole, although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while Google users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches), Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages). Successful advertising campaigns on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks.\n\n[4] Facebook: In February 2015, Facebook announced that it had reached two million active advertisers with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser is an advertiser that has advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days. In March 2016, Facebook announced that it reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the US. Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on ad auction bids, potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other onlien advertising platforms like google and twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of advertising visa a vis traditional mass advertising modes like television and print. Marketing on facebook is employed through two methods based on the surfing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.\n\n[5] Targeted advertising: The Facebook recruitment advertisement is offers wider and cost-effective research compared with newspaper advertisement. For instance, the recruitment was conducted by the United States in 2015 to recruit survey participant about smokers. The company recruited smokers through people's profile information, such as location, area of interest, ages, and occupation. They yielded 56,621 viewed within the 18-day campaign. The 1.97% of viewer(1121) clicked the advertisement to the recruitment poster at a cost of $1.51 per a survey, 37.7% of participants(423) finished the full survey. Also, when people were recruited it took way less time because company already have collected people's information through Facebook. One the other hands, the newspaper recruited 30 participants in 3-day advertisement, but only 10 out of 30 participants completed the survey. The cost for recruitment was $40.80 per one complete survey. Also, newspaper advertisement have ask people 's name, age, and occupation through additional surveys, which was not required in Facebook recruitment. Likewise, Facebook advertisement have much lower cost for advertisement and more less time consuming.\n\n[6] Facebook: A Russian company bought more than $100,000 worth of Facebook ads during the 2016 presidential election. Special Council Robert Mueller, contacted Facebook subsequently to the company's disclosure that it sold ads to a Russian Spy Agency-linked company (Internet Research Agency), and the Menlo Park-based company has pledged full cooperation in Mueller's investigation, and began with providing all information about the advertisement buys by the Russian government, including the identities of the individuals and companies who made the purchases. \"The Daily Beast\" reports that Russia Used Facebook Events to Organize Anti-Immigrant Rallies on U.S. Soil. Facebook has concluded that a 225,000-member anti-immigrant group that attempted to organize anti-Clinton rallies in Texas during the 2016 presidential campaign was \"likely operated out of Russia\", \"Business Insider\" reports. Russians also staged anti-Trump rallies in November 2016 and bought a Black Lives Matter Facebook ad during the 2016 campaign. \"Pro-Publica\" also reported on how Facebook Enabled Advertisers to Reach 'Jew Haters.' Facebook enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to the news feeds of almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of \"Jew hater,\" \"How to burn jews,\" or, \"History of 'why jews ruin the world.'\"\n\n[7] Social network advertising: Facebook, the hugely popular social network, has developed a targeting technology which allows advertisements to reach a specific audience. This is within the Facebook product called Facebook Ads, which is available to users and businesses alike. When posting an ad through the Facebook Ad Manager, an advertiser is provided a set of characteristics that will define his target market. Facebook calls this audience targeting. These traits include geographical location, gender, age, work, relationship status, and interests such as music, among others. Facebook claims that advertisers can even customize their target audience based on their behavior such as purchasing patterns, device usage, and other activities. This is why Facebook users see advertisements on their profile page that are relevant to their preferences and their interests. This allows the ads to be less intrusive and more successful in achieving their goals. The advertisement algorithm is also capable of monitoring performance so that advertisers or Facebook marketers are able to modify their audience as well as the nature, budget, and duration of the ads based on its performance.\n\n[8] Privacy concerns with social networking services: The illegal activities on Facebook are very widespread, in particular, phishing attacks, allowing attackers to steal other people's passwords. The Facebook users are led to land on a page where they are asked for their login information, and their personal information is stolen in that way. According to the news from \"PC World Business Center\" which was published on April 22, 2010, we can know that a hacker named Kirllos illegally stole and sold 1.5 million Facebook IDs to some business companies who want to attract potential customers by using advertisements on Facebook. Their illegal approach is that they used accounts which were bought from hackers to send advertisements to friends of users. When friends see the advertisements, they will have opinion about them, because \"People will follow it because they believe it was a friend that told them to go to this link,\" said Randy Abrams, director of technical education with security vendor Eset. There were 2.2232% of the population on Facebook that believed or followed the advertisements of their friends. Even though the percentage is small, the amount of overall users on Facebook is more than 400 million worldwide. The influence of advertisements on Facebook is so huge and obvious. According to the blog of Alan who just posted advertisements on the Facebook, he earned $300 over the 4 days. That means he can earn $3 for every $1 put into it. The huge profit attracts hackers to steal users' login information on Facebook, and business people who want to buy accounts from hackers send advertisements to users' friends on Facebook.\n\n[9] Social media optimization: The number of businesses that use Facebook to advertise also holds significant relevance. Currently there are three million businesses that advertise on Facebook. This makes Facebook the world's largest platform for social media advertising. What also holds importance is the amount of money leading businesses are spending on Facebook advertising alone. Procter & Gamble spend $60 million every year on Facebook advertising. Other advertisers on Facebook include Microsoft, with a yearly spend of £35 million, Amazon, Nestle and American Express all with yearly expenditures above £25 million per year.\n\n[10] Social media marketing: Facebook pages are far more detailed than Twitter accounts. They allow a product to provide videos, photos, and longer descriptions, and testimonials as other followers can comment on the product pages for others to see. Facebook can link back to the product's Twitter page as well as send out event reminders. As of May 2015, 93% of businesses marketers use Facebook to promote their brand. A study from 2011 attributed 84% of \"engagement\" or clicks to Likes that link back to Facebook advertising. By 2014, Facebook had restricted the content published from businesses' and brands' pages. Adjustments in Facebook algorithms have reduced the audience for non-paying business pages (that have at least 500,000 \"Likes\") from 16% in 2012 down to 2% in February 2014.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

The inaugural race was on December 6, 2009. For the last five years the Santa Barbara City College has been the official host for the finish line and general operations. Rusty and June Snow are the co-directors of the race with Dan Campbell as the technical director. The Snow's moved from the East Coast and wanted to bring a marathon to Santa Barbara. After a few years of getting the race approved and organized it was finally set to happen in 2009, Rusty Snow states, “I learned to be stubborn from running marathons.” The Santa Barbara International Marathon course serves as a Boston Marathon qualifier.\n\n[2] Santa Barbara Marathon: The Santa Barbara International Marathon and Half Marathon is a road race in Southern California. The race was first run in 1965 and was one of the first marathons in California. Since Santa Barbara itself is a popular tourist destination, it is also becoming a popular destination marathon. The point-to-point marathon course currently start at Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta and finish at Santa Barbara City College in Santa Barbara, California. The marathon race can be used to obtain a qualifying time for the Boston Marathon.\n\n[3] Santa Barbara International Marathon: The race took place on December 5, 2010. 998 marathon finishers crossed the line which is a lower amount than the previous year, a majority of the racers, 2,297, participated in the half marathon. Moniwda Marube was the overall winner of the marathon with a time of 2:25:49. The first woman to cross the finish line was Liz Gottlieb with a time of 3:01:07. Andrea McLarty who won the marathon for the women in 2009 finished as the first female in the half marathon with a time of 1:21:06. There was a course change this year as well, runners no longer finish outside of the Santa Barbara City College stadium, they now enter the stadium and finish with a three-quarters lap around the track.\n\n[4] Santa Barbara International Marathon: The original Santa Barbara marathon took place from 1965-1984. A group of distance runners created the event. During this time frame in the United States, only five annual marathons were up and running. In 1965, twenty seven individuals started the race, which began at the University of California Santa Barbara and ended at the Santa Barbara City College, where seventeen runners finished the race. The following year, the City College served as the start and finish line. During the race, there were no aid stations and runners did not have the roads blocked off to prevent vehicle traffic. In 1977, there were a total of 354 runners, but the number of participants began to decline, and the event eventually ended as runners were attracted to other more popular marathons.\n\n[5] Santa Barbara International Marathon: In 2012, the New York City Marathon was cancelled due to the destruction of Hurricane Sandy. The race directors offered a discount to participate in the Santa Barbara International Marathon and Half Marathon to those that were scheduled to run the New York City Marathon.\n\n[6] Santa Barbara International Marathon: The inaugural race took place on December 6, 2009. 1,686 marathon participants crossed the finish line and another 300 finishers crossed the line for the marathon relay event. Carlos Handler was the overall winner with a time of 2:24:48.7. Andrea McLarty was the first woman finisher with a time of 2:52:23.6.\n\n[7] Santa Barbara International Marathon: The marathon took place on November 10, 2012. The winner of the 2012 marathon was Abraham Kogo with a time of 2:23:10.6. Following Kogo was Scott Downard of Oklahoma with a time of 2:28:19.1. A Colorado woman, Paige Higgins finished with a time of 2:48:35 which is four minuets faster than the course record for women, the record was previously held by Andrea McLarty. Higgins was the seventh individual to cross the marathon finish line overall. There were 5,064 individuals that finished the marathon, half marathon and marathon relay in total, which was an increase from the previous year.\n\n[8] Sports in Jammu and Kashmir: Marathons that have been conducted in the region include the Ladakh Marathon, the Great Tibetan Marathon and the Kashmir International Half Marathon. The Ladakh Marathon is recognised by Association of International Marathons and Distance Races and is one of the highest marathon in the world.\n\n[9] Bogotá Half Marathon: The Bogotá International Half Marathon (), or mmB as it is traditionally known, is an annual road running competition over a half marathon distance taking place in Bogotá, Colombia in late July or early August. Established in 2000, it holds IAAF Gold Label Road Race status, making it the first and thus far only South American race to achieve this accreditation. The competition features both elite and popular (or recreational) sections within the half marathon and 10K races. Around 45,000 runners take part in the competition's events each year.\n\n[10] Sylvia Mosqueda: Sylvia has found her best success at the Half Marathon distance, where she won the 2001 National Championships. She was runner up in 2000. Those results put her on the US National team at the 2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. She had further Half Marathon victories in the Austin Half Marathon and the America's Finest City Half Marathon. She set her personal record of 2:33:47 in the Marathon at the New York City Marathon in 2002. Along with a 2:36:38 at the Los Angeles Marathon, that brought her to number 4 on the US rankings that year. She also holds the course record at the 3M Half Marathon. 2003 New York Marathon 2:33.10 First American 10th, 3M Half Marathon 2004 P.R. 1:09.51 First overall\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich European country is divided into areas called Cantons?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Canton (country subdivision): A canton is a type of administrative division of a country. In general, cantons are relatively small in terms of area and population when compared with other administrative divisions such as counties, departments, or provinces. Internationally, the best-known cantons - and the most politically important - are those of Switzerland. As the constituents of the Swiss Confederation, theoretically (and historically), the Swiss cantons are semi-sovereign states.\n\n[2] Religion in Switzerland: Until the 1970s, Protestants made up a majority of the Swiss population, decreasing to about a fourth nowadays. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities have today more Catholics than Protestants, due to a steady rise of the unaffiliated population in general combined with Catholic immigration from countries such as Italy, Spain, and Portugal, who mostly immigrated during the second half of the 20th century, and a less important immigration from Croatia during the last 25 years. 31% of all Catholics are foreign nationals versus 5% of Protestants. The unaffiliated form 25% of Switzerland's population in 2016, and are especially strong in the canton of Basel-City, the canton of Neuchâtel, the canton of Geneva, the canton of Vaud, and Zürich. The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholics and Protestants, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, Valais, Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, Jura, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel-Country, St Gallen and the half of Aargau are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, which came after the clashes between Catholic and Protestant cantons that culminated in the \"Sonderbundskrieg\", consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.\n\n[3] Canton System (Prussia): The Canton System (German: \"Kantonsystem\" or \"Kantonssystem\") or Canton Regulation (\"Kantonreglement\") was a system of recruitment used by the Prussian army between 1733 and 1813. The country was divided into recruiting districts called cantons (\"Kantone\"), and each canton was the responsibility of a regiment. The system was a Prussian distinctive. Every male was from the youngest possible age enrolled in the army, and by 1740 the Prussian army, with a strength of 3.6% of the total population, was proportionately the largest in Europe. The new system replaced coercive recruiting, which in turn replaced the hiring of undependable and expensive mercenary forces. It allowed the army to double from 38,000 to 76,000, making it the fourth largest in Europe, and it linked the local population more closely to the royal government.\n\n[4] Canton of Bern: The canton of Bern is mainly drained by the river Aare and its tributaries. The area of the canton is commonly divided into six regions. The most populated area is the Bernese Mittelland on the plateau north of the Alps, with the capital city of Bern. The northmost part of the canton is the Bernese Jura bordering the Canton of Jura. The Bernese Oberland is the mountainous region which lies in the south of the canton.\n\n[5] Cartagena Province: The territory of Cartagena province had different administrative subdivisions over the course of its history. At first it was subdivided into \"partidos\", which in the late colonial period were known as \"jurisdicciones\" (jurisdictions). In 1675 the province included the \"partidos\" of Cartagena, Mompós and Tolu, while in 1776 the province was divided into the five \"partidos\" of Cartagena de Indias, Tierradentro, Mahates, Barranca, Tolu and Mompós. With the advent of independence, the boundaries of the old jurisdictions were changed, with the new subdivisions being called \"cantones\" (cantons). Many of the inhabitants were not happy with these changes, and consequently, usage of some of the new iterations wes suppressed. In 1825 the province was divided into the cantons of Cartagena de Indias, Barranca nueva, Carmen, Mompós, Simití and Tolu, then in 1835 it was divided into the cantons of Cartagena, Barranquilla, Corozal, Chinú, Lorica, Mahates, Sabanalarga, San Andrés and Soledad. These were all subdivided into parishes and villages.\n\n[6] Croat entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina: During the Bosnian War (1992–95), Bosnian Croats founded their own sub-national entity, Herzeg-Bosnia, which de facto functioned as a mini state, with its own army, police, parliament etc. In 1994, under the Washington Agreement, Croats joined their territory, Herzeg-Bosnia, with the Bosniak-government controlled areas (the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina) to create a subnational entity, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) with joint institutions. The 1995 Dayton Agreement that ended the war left the country divided into two political entities, the Serb-dominated and controlled Republika Srpska and this Bosniak-Croat Federation. FBiH was further divided into 10 autonomous cantons to ensure equality. The FBiH government and a bicameral Parliament were supposed to guarantee power-sharing and equal representation to the less numerous Croats. Some dissatisfaction with this situation was displayed by Croats already in 1999 together with the calls for an establishment of a Croat-majority federal unit, but the Croat member of the state presidency dismissed it and called for strengthening of the principle of equality of three communities and of canton autonomy.\n\n[7] German-speaking Community of Belgium: The area known today as the East Cantons consists of the German-speaking Community and the municipalities of Malmedy and Waimes (), which belong to the French Community of Belgium. The East Cantons were part of the Rhine Province of Prussia in Germany until 1920 (as the counties (') of Eupen and Malmedy), but were annexed by Belgium following Germany's defeat in World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles. Thus they also became known as the ', \"redeemed cantons\". The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the \"questioning\" of the local population. People who were unwilling to become Belgians and wanted the region to remain a part of Germany were required to register themselves along with their full name and address with the Belgian military administration, headed by Herman Baltia, and many feared reprisals or even expulsion for doing so.\n\n[8] Cantons of Ecuador: The Cantons of Ecuador are the second-level subdivisions of Ecuador, below the provinces. There are 221 cantons in the country, of which three are not in any province. The cantons are further sub-divided into parishes, which are classified as either urban or rural. Below is a list of cantons by province.\n\n[9] Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy: The Ticino region consisted of several city-states along the Ticino river. Following the conquest of the region, it was divided into four \"Ticino Bailiwicks\" which were under the joint administration of the 13 Cantons after 1512. The four bailiwicks were \"Valle di Maggia\" (), Locarno (), Lugano () and Mendrisio (). The area also included several other territories that were owned by one or more cantons. These included: the Bailiwick of Bellinzona (), Blenio () and Riviera () which were owned by Uri, Schwyz, and Nidwalden as well as the bailiwick Leventina () (owned by Uri) and even the Val d'Ossola (). There were also three Italian-speaking subjects areas of the Three Leagues (Bormio, Valtellina and Chiavenna) which were not included in the \"Ticino Bailiwicks\".\n\n[10] Tourism in Ecuador: Salinas it is a city of Province of Santa Elena. It is the cantonal head of Salinas Canton. It has a population of 34 719 inhabitants and its urban area is divided in 4 parishes. It is located at the western end of the province and the mainland of the country; part of the urban area of sprig of Santa Elena, along with La Libertad, Santa Helena, José Luis Tamayo and Ballenita.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Robosapien was released in 2004, and over 1.5 million were reportedly sold in the first five months of sale. Robosapien was the first commercially available biomorphic robot, and the first to integrate personality-like features. Tilden continued to develop the line with the Robosapien V2 (released in 2005), which added functionality like speech capability; RS Media™ robot (released in 2006), which included user-created functions, and Roboreptile (also in 2006). The Roboquad a four-wheeled robot (released in 2007); the RS Tri-Bot, a three-wheeled robot (released in summer 2008), and RS Media (2006).\n\n[2] RoboSapien: Robosapien is a toy-like biomorphic robot designed by Mark Tilden and produced by WowWee toys. The Robosapien X was made to entertain and will react to sounds and touch. The Robosapien is preprogrammed with moves, and also can be controlled by an infrared remote control included with the toy, or by either a personal computer equipped with an infrared PDA.\n\n[3] Robosapien: Rebooted: In March 2007, WowWee, the company that makes the toy Robosapien, announced that it planned to produce a feature film about the toy that would combine live-action and computer-generated elements. WowWee entered a partnership with Arad Productions, run by producer Avi Arad, who was interested in Robosapien since the toy debuted. \"Time\" reported the planned film as part of a growing trend to make films based on toys, citing the 2007 releases \"Transformers\" and \"\". Arad took an active roll in developing the lead character for the film. He worked very closely with Art Director Shane Nakamura and the design team at WowWee. In August 2008, feature film rights were officially sold by WowWee to producer duo Arad and Steven Paul, the latter producing films under Crystal Sky Pictures. The film was revealed to be titled \"Robosapien: Rebooted\", and in the negotiation, WowWee reserved the worldwide right to market toys related to the film and to receive a portion of returns for other merchandise related to the film. Sean McNamara was hired to direct the film. Filming took place in New Orleans in 2008 from March 24-April 25. The city was chosen because Arad became familiar with it when he attended National Association of Television Program Executives conventions there in the 1980s and 1990s. He also chose the city to take advantage of tax breaks and its scenery; the story was also rewritten so it would recognizably take place in New Orleans. In September 2010, Arc Productions (formerly Starz Animation) joined the project with Crystal Sky and Arad Productions.\n\n[4] RoboSapien: In January 2007, two new Robosapien variants were introduced at the Toy Fair in London, styled after Spider-Man and Homer Simpson, respectively. The Spidersapien features Spider-Man styled armor, and an array of Spider-Man sound effects. It was launched together with \"Spider-Man 3\". Homersapien was launched to coincide with the release of \"The Simpsons Movie\". He is similarly adapted with sound bites and a sculpted Homer head, as well as a unique Simpsons accessory and packaging. Also Robosapien comes in chrome red, blue, silver with blue eyes, gold, green, and also clear, other than the original white.\n\n[5] Mark Tilden: Having left government service and moved to Hong Kong, Tilden currently works as a freelance robotics designer, consultant and lecturer. His commercial products are marketed through WowWee Toys. Biomorphic robot-based items include B.I.O. Bugs (2001), Constructobots (2002), G.I Joe Hoverstrike (2003), RoboSapien (2004), Robosapien v2 (2005), Roboraptor (2005), Robopet (2005), Roboreptile (2006), RS Media (2006, co-developed with Davin Sufer and Maxwell Bogue), Roboquad (2007), Roboboa (2007), the humanform Femisapien (2008), Joebot (2009), and the Roomscooper floor-cleaning robot (2010).\n\n[6] Roboraptor: Roboraptor is a robotic toy invented by Mark Tilden in 1999, and then distributed by Wow Wee Toys International. It is the successor to the RoboSapien robot and uses motion technology based on realistic biomechanics that give it fluid and natural movements. It has a multi-function remote control that uses infrared technology to talk to it. Unlike the original RoboSapien, the Roboraptor is capable of autonomous movement, using 3 realistic gaits.\n\n[7] Jumbo Machinder: Over the years, Popy Toy tinkered with the name and characteristics of the Jumbo Machinder series. In the 1976-1977 period, several characters were released under the \"Jumbo Machinder Deluxe\" name. Aside from the brand name change, the toys are largely identical aesthetically to their predecessors.For the 1979-1980 season, the Jumbo Machinders series was re-designed and re-branded as the Kyodai Robotto Kojo (\"Giant Robot Factory\"). Unlike their predecessors, the Giant Robot Factory toys were sold disassembled, allowing children to bolt the characters together with a simple tool provided in the package. Aside from the fact that they were sold in a disassembled manner and featured more complicated gimmicks (such as spring-loaded shooting fists), the Giant Robot Factory toys feature a very similar aesthetic to their predecessors and are considered by most collectors to be part of the same series.\n\n[8] RoboSapien: Mark Tilden designed the Robosapien to be easily modified or hacked. The electronics inside the toy are easily accessed and clearly labeled. A growing community of hackers have devoted themselves to adding new functionality to the robot. Some hacks have added a live video camera, others an LED belt that displays text, headlights, a coil gun, speech synthesis, a \"flamethrower\" (a small torch) and more. A modified RoboSapien is also used in the 2009 revival of The Electric Company.\n\n[9] Robosapien v2: The Robosapien V2 is the second generation of Mark Tilden's Robosapien robot. It is nearly twice the size of the original robot, standing around tall. Instead of the original caveman grunts the V2 can speak a large list of pre-recorded phrases. It has infrared and basic color recognition sensors, grip sensors in its hands, touch or contact activated hand and foot sensors, and sonic sensors as well. For movement the V2 has an articulated waist, shoulders, and hands giving him a variety of body animations. The Robosapien V2 model was designed by Mark Tilden and is an autonomous robot. The Robosapien V2 comes packaged with a remote,and the robot. It is an \"evolved\" form of Robosapien V1.\n\n[10] R.O.B.: R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy), released in Japan as the , is an accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was launched in July 1985 in Japan, and October 1985 in North America. It had a short lifespan, with support for only two games which comprise the \"Robot Series\": \"Gyromite\" and \"Stack-Up\". R.O.B. was released with the intention of portraying the Nintendo Entertainment System as a novel toy in order to alleviate retail fears following the North American video game crash of 1983. R.O.B. was produced in the Deluxe Set, a configuration for the console that includes, among other things, R.O.B. and \"Gyromite\". \"Stack-Up\" was packaged separately and includes its own physical game pieces.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The reason for polishing is a result of the composition and structure of the rice grain itself. The core of the rice grain is rich in starch, while the outer layers of the grain contain higher concentrations of fats, vitamins and proteins. Since higher concentration of fat and protein in the sake would lead to off-flavors and contribute rough elements to the sake, the outer layers of the sake rice grain is milled away in a polishing process, leaving only the starchy part of the grain (some sake brewers remove over 60% of the rice grain in the polishing process). That desirable pocket of starch in the center of the grain is called the shinpaku (心白). It usually takes 2 to 3 days to polish rice down to less than half its original size. The rice powder that is a by-product of the polishing is very often used for making rice crackers, or Japanese sweets (i.e. Dango), and other food stuffs. If the sake is made with rice that has a higher percentage of its husk and outer portion of the core milled off, then more rice will be required to make that particular sake, and it will take longer to make. As a result, sake made with rice that has been highly milled (much of the rice has been polished off) is usually more expensive than a sake that has been made using less polished rice. However, this does not always mean that sake made by highly milled rice is of better quality than sake made by rice that has been milled less. Rice polishing ratio, called \"Seimai-buai\" (see Glossary of sake terms) measures the degree of rice polishing. For example, rice polishing ratio of 60% means that the 60% of the original rice grain remains and the 40% has been polished away\n\n[2] Sake: The rice used for brewing sake is called \"saka mai\" (sake rice), or officially \"shuzō kōtekimai\" (sake-brewing suitable rice). There are at least 80 types of sake rice in Japan. Among these, Yamadanishiki, Gohyakumangoku, Miyamanishiki and Omachi rice are very popular. The grain is larger, stronger (If a grain is small or weak, it will break in the process of polishing), and contains less protein and lipid than the ordinary rice eaten by the Japanese.  Sake rice is used only for making sake, because it is unpalatable for eating.\n\n[3] Glossary of sake terms: a cocktail consisting of heated sake, sugar and a raw egg sake aged in wooden barrels or bottled in wooden casks. The wood used is Cryptomeria (杉, sugi), which is also known as Japanese cedar. Sake casks are often tapped ceremonially for the opening of buildings, businesses, parties, etc. Because the wood imparts a strong flavor, premium sake is rarely used for this type. sake with a deliberately high rice-polishing ratio. It is generally held that the lower the rice polishing ratio (the percent weight after polishing), the better the potential of the sake. However, beginning around 2005, teiseihaku-shu has been produced as a specialty sake made with high rice-polishing ratios, usually around 80%, to produce sake with the characteristic flavor of rice itself. the faux pas of pouring one's own drink sake pressed into 18-liter (4.0 imp gal; 4.8 U.S. gal) bottles (\"tobin\") with the brewer selecting the best sake of the batch for shipping. the head sake brewer at a sake brewery  Special Genuine brew, to differentiate from a brewery's regular Honjōzō Special pure rice sake made with rice polished to 60% or less of its original size. Costs more than a brewery's regular junmai. sake bottle which is tall and slender with a narrow mouth made from ceramic, metal or glass special-designation sake, collectively referring to honjozoshu, junmaishu, and ginjoshu\n\n[4] Korean cuisine: \"Soju\" is a clear spirit which was originally made from grain, especially rice, and is now also made from sweet potatoes or barley. \"Soju\" made from grain is considered superior (as is also the case with grain vs. potato vodka). \"Soju\" is around 22% ABV, and is a favorite beverage of hard-up college students, hard-drinking businessmen, and blue-collar workers.\n\n[5] Nada-ku, Kobe: The most essential factors for making pure sake are good grain polishing ability and low temperatures. In the five sake-producing districts in Nada, water from the river that flows from Mount Rokkō into the sea is used to power rice-polishing water mills, thus producing highly polished grains of rice, which is not possible with manpower alone. Furthermore, the combination of the cold winds, known as 'Rokko oroshi', and the influence of the inland sea makes for ideal weather conditions for brewing sake in winter.\n\n[6] Nada-ku, Kobe: Yamada Nishiki rice is grown in the Banshu eastern Kansai plains. It has larger, softer grains than regular table rice and is starchy, which makes it particularly suitable for sake making. Grains of Yamadanishiki rice have hard starch cores. This means that when they are soaked in Miyamizu water, they dissolve slowly but do not lose their shape. It is said that this characteristic is the reason why Yamadanishiki produces such uniquely flavored sake.\n\n[7] Rectified spirit: Neutral spirits can be produced from grains, corn, grapes, sugar beets, sugarcane, tubers, or other fermented plant materials. In particular, large quantities of neutral alcohol are distilled from wine. A product made from grain is \"grain neutral spirit\", while a spirit made from grapes is called \"grape neutral spirit\" or \"vinous alcohol\".\n\n[8] Stil de grain yellow: Traditional Sap Green is made both from ripe and unripe buckthorn berries, and prepared in different ways. Berry harvest time, varietal, preparation method and time period of use have a lot to do with the common name used to refer to that particular hue, color, recipe or chemical composition.\n\n[9] Almanac Beer Company: Almanac followed with \"Autumn 2011 Farmhouse Pale\", a Belgian-style farmhouse ale brewed with 1,000 pounds of organic San Joaquin Valley plums from Twin Girls Farm in Yettem, California and organic wheat from Massa Organics in Glenn County, California. In April 2012, the Fairmont San Francisco hotel's Laurel Court Restaurant and Bar began offering variation of this release on draft, brewed with 200 pounds of honey from the hotel's rooftop apiary. The collaboration was part of a hospitality industry trend in which hotels brew their own beer or work with local brewers. The resulting beer was described by a reporter as having \"the light feel of a wheat beer with a tinkling of hop bitterness, plus sour notes from the farmhouse approach and a lingering touch of honeycomb.\"\n\n[10] California wine: Since the wine renaissance of the 1960s, the quality of California's dessert and fortified wines have been dramatically improved. Beringer was one of the first to create a botrytized wine from Sauvignon blanc and Sémillon. Though unlike in Sauternes, Beringer's wine was made of grapes regularly harvested and then introduced at the winery to \"Botrytis cinerea\" spores created in a laboratory. Since then California winemakers in places like the Anderson Valley AVA have found vineyards where this noble rot can occur naturally on the grapes. The Anderson and Alexander Valley AVAs have also developed a reputation for their Late Harvest wines made from Riesling. Several French and Italian style Muscat wines are produced throughout California and are known for their intense aromatics and balanced acidity. The port-style wines in California are often made from the traditional Portuguese wine grapes like Touriga Nacional, Tinta Cão and Tinta Roriz. Some uniquely Californian styles are also made from Zinfandel and Petite Sirah.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The crow genus makes up a third of the species in the family Corvidae. The members appear to have evolved in Asia from the corvid stock, which had evolved in Australia. The collective name for a group of crows is a \"flock\" or a \"murder\". The genus name is Latin for \"raven\".\n\n[2] Hooded crow: The hooded crow was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th-century work \"Systema Naturae\" and it bears its original name of \"Corvus cornix\". The binomial name is derived from the Latin words \"Corvus\", \"raven\", and \"cornix\", \"crow\". It was subsequently considered a subspecies of the carrion crow for many years, hence known as \"Corvus corone cornix\", due to similarities in structure and habits.\n\n[3] Crow Museum of Asian Art: The Crow Museum was partially closed for the majority of 2018 as it underwent renovations and an expansion. After years of thoughtful planning and development, the museum dramatically expanded its footprint along the southwest corner of Harwood and Flora Streets in the Dallas Arts District. Oglesby Greene Architects of Dallas, which handled earlier renovations of the museum, led the expansion project. The Beck Group was the general contractor. In September 2018, the Crow Collection changed their name to the Crow Museum of Asian Art, a name that reflects not only the breadth of the collection and programming but also the museum’s wide and diverse community support.\n\n[4] Palm crow: The palm crow (\"Corvus palmarum\") is a relatively small black bird in the crow family that occurs mostly on the large Caribbean island of Hispaniola, itself divided into the two countries of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. It was formerly quite frequent on Cuba but has become severely reduced in number and may be almost extinct there. This form is slightly smaller and is usually separated as a sub-species called \"Corvus palmarum minutus\". Both forms are usually now given the respective common names of Hispaniolan palm crow and Cuban palm crow to distinguish them.\n\n[5] The Horrible Crowes: Fallon announced the formation of the Horrible Crowes on January 20, 2011, on his blog, explaining that \"the name comes from a poem called the \"Twa Corbies\", which means \"two crows\". He added: \"Check it out, it's a dark commentary on life. It's the darker side of soul music, it's slow, it slithers, and it's raw. At the same time, the melodies and pianos are a juxtaposition to the topic material because it's eerily soothing. I'm really proud of what's been coming out and we'll see how it goes, but it's in the works and it's heading for an actual record.\"\n\n[6] White-crested laughingthrush: White-crested laughingthrushes are social birds, usually in flocks of 6-12 individuals (but reportedly up to 40). These small parties can be very noisy as a leader initiates a call (typically with short syllables such as \"ow”, “u’ow” or “u’ah\") and is answered with a chorus, in sometimes disorderly fashion. The name \"laughingthrush\" comes from the \"loud cackling outbursts\" they produce, often followed by a quieter, more pleasant chatter or muttering (\"kerWICKerWICK\" or \"nYUKoop nYUKoop\"). In total, 4 different types of vocalizations exist, in order of increasing length and complexity: short sounds, phrases (repeated elements), sentences and subsongs. Since they are a highly gregarious species, most of the sounds they produce serve a social purpose, such as reminding other members of their flock of their presence and their movements, alerting them of danger or intruders, or inciting mobbing (they are known to be aggressive birds of different flocks or species).\n\n[7] White-necked crow: The white-necked crow (\"Corvus leucognaphalus\") is the largest ( in length) of the four Caribbean crow species. Two other species, the Cuban crow (\"Corvus nasicus\") and the Jamaican crow (\"Corvus jamaicensis\"), appear to be very closely related to it sharing several key morphological features. The fourth species from this region, the palm crow (\"Corvus palmarum\"), would appear to be a later arrival (at least in evolutionary terms) and shows affinities with the fish crow (\"C. ossifragus\") of North America and two Mexican species.\n\n[8] Dots (candy): Crows, black licorice flavored gum drops, are also considered to be part of the Dots family, created in the 1890s by confectioners Ernest Von Au and Joseph Maison. There is an urban legend that crows were to be called \"Black Rose,\" but the printer misheard the name as \"Black Crows\" and printed wrappers with the wrong name on them. However, research—including the fact that the name was copyrighted before the candies ever came with wrappers—reveals that this story is not true.\n\n[9] Rook (bird): Rooks are distinguished from similar members of the crow family by the bare grey-white skin around the base of the adult's bill in front of the eyes. The feathering around the legs also looks shaggier and laxer than the congeneric carrion crow. The juvenile is superficially more similar to the crow because it lacks the bare patch at the base of the bill, but it has a thinner bill and loses the facial feathers after about six months. Collective nouns for rooks include \"building\", \"parliament\", \"clamour\" and \"storytelling\". Their colonial nesting behaviour gave rise to the term rookery.\n\n[10] Hooded crow: The hooded crow (\"Corvus cornix\") (also called hoodie) is a Eurasian bird species in the \"Corvus\" genus. Widely distributed, it is also known locally as Scotch crow and Danish crow. In Ireland, it is called \"caróg liath\" or grey crow, just as in the Slavic languages and in Danish. In German, it is called \"mist crow\" (\"Nebelkrähe\"). Found across Northern, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe, as well as parts of the Middle East, it is an ashy grey bird with black head, throat, wings, tail, and thigh feathers, as well as a black bill, eyes, and feet. Like other corvids, it is an omnivorous and opportunistic forager and feeder.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Ed Macauley was replaced with Paul Seymour. On the court, rookie Lenny Wilkens was averaging 11.7 points per game in his first year. The brunt of the scoring came from the Hawks' front line of Bob Pettit, Cliff Hagan, and Clyde Lovellette. They combined for 72.0 points per game, and the Hawks won the West by 15 games. The Hawks finished the season with a record of 51–28. In the playoffs, the Hawks needed a 1-point overtime win in Game 6 on the road to force a 7th game with the Los Angeles Lakers. Game 7 was played in St. Louis and the Hawks beat the Lakers by 2 points. The Hawks then were up against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. The Hawks fell in 5 games as the Celtics won their 4th NBA Title in 5 seasons.\n\n[2] Cleo Hill: In 2008, Hill was profiled in a segment on the ESPN documentary \"Black Magic\", which told the story of African Americans and basketball. The segment asserted that early in that 1961–62 season, St. Louis Hawks coach Paul Seymour was told by team management to severely diminish Hill's offensive role so that stars Bob Pettit, Cliff Hagan, and Clyde Lovellette (who were all white) would receive more shot attempts. Seymour refused and was fired, and Hill's scoring averaged dropped from 10.8 points per game to 5.5 points per game. Hill never played in the NBA after that season.\n\n[3] Paul Seymour (basketball): Seymour was mentioned in the ESPN documentary, Black Magic, which told the story of African-Americans and basketball. In a segment about Cleo Hill, it was revealed that during the 1961–62 season, Bob Pettit and Cliff Hagan approached management and complained that Hill was taking too many shots. (Allegedly, this was just a cover-up for their desire to not play with an African-American teammate.) Management granted their wish, telling Seymour to severely diminish Hill's offensive role. Seymour refused and was fired 14 games into the season.\n\n[4] 1956–57 St. Louis Hawks season: The 1956–57 St. Louis Hawks season was the 11th season for the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Prior to the start of the season, the Hawks made one of the biggest draft-day deals in NBA history. The Hawks sent 2nd overall pick Bill Russell to the Boston Celtics for Cliff Hagan and second-year star Ed Macauley. Macauley had been a popular player at St. Louis University. The Hawks struggled for most of the season and coach Red Holzman was fired midway through the season. The new head coach was Slater Martin, who led the Hawks to a 5–3 record. Martin did not want the added responsibility of head coach, so Alex Hannum took over for the rest of the season. Despite a 34–38 record, the Hawks claimed the Western Division by a tiebreaker and earned a bye into the Western Finals, where the Hawks swept the Minneapolis Lakers in three straight games. The Hawks met the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. The Hawks won Game 1 in double overtime, 125–123 in Boston. The Celtics took Game 2 and the Hawks took Game 3 at home by 2 points. After losing Game 5 in Boston, the Hawks needed another victory at home to force a decisive seventh game. Game 7 in Boston went into double overtime and the Celtics emerged victorious, winning by 2 points.\n\n[5] Paul Seymour (basketball): While coaching at Baltimore during the 1965–1966 season, Seymour deliberately ended Johnny Kerr's then-record consecutive-games-played streak of 844 games by benching the team captain for one game. According to Kerr, only after the game did Seymour tell Kerr about his intention to end Kerr's streak, saying, \"This will take the pressure off you.\"\n\n[6] 1958–59 St. Louis Hawks season: The 1958–59 St. Louis Hawks season was the franchise's 13th season in the NBA. Despite winning the NBA Championship, Alex Hannum was replaced as coach of the Hawks in 1958–59. The new coach was Andy Phillip, and he lasted 10 games before being replaced by Ed Macauley. The Hawks made player changes. Clyde Lovellette was brought in from the Cincinnati Royals. The Hawks won the Western Division with a record of 49 wins and 23 losses. Bob Pettit won his 2nd NBA MVP award as he led the league in scoring with 29.2 points per game. In the Western Division Finals, the Hawks were defeated by the Minneapolis Lakers in 6 games.\n\n[7] Altrincham Aces: 1988-89 certainly boosted air travel. Jamieson returned for a second season and was joined by forwards Scott Dick and Brian Jokat and a young defenceman, Colin McHaffie from Ayr. Dick was soon replaced by Marc ‘Moose’ Damphousse and Jokat was then injured to be replaced by Michel Couvrette. The two French Canadians then went on a scoring spree for several glorious weeks before Couvrette was released due to attitude problems, Dick returning briefly before Jokat’s injury healed. By now, Damphousse was suffering from a groin injury and after rescuing Metros from an embarrassing home defeat to Sunderland with eight goals and three assists, most coming in a memorable final period, Moose too was gone to be replaced by Darren Treloar. Soon after, there was an infamous home game with Telford Tigers. Metros had pulled themselves back into the match at 5-6 before Chuck Taylor started a fight after Jokat had gone in on goal. It seemed that Telford targeted our imports and after Jokat and Treloar as well as McHaffie and Tony Harcourt had departed along with Taylor and lesser Tigers, Telford finished the match (now 3 on 3 with all the penalties) still with three imports and ran out easy 10-6 winners.\n\n[8] Atlanta Hawks: On June 20, 2017, Howard was traded, along with the 31st overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft, to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Marco Bellinelli, Miles Plumlee, and the 41st overall pick in the same draft. Two days later, the Hawks selected Wake Forest power forward John Collins with the 19th overall pick. On July 13, 2017, Paul Millsap left the Hawks by signing a multi-year deal with the Denver Nuggets. Although Collins developed into a valuable asset, the loss of Howard and Millsap proved insurmountable for the rebuilding Hawks as they finished with a 24–58 record in the 2017–18 season, last in the Eastern Conference, and missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2006–07 season. On April 25, 2018, the Hawks and head coach Mike Budenholzer had mutually decided to part ways.\n\n[9] 1963–64 NHL season: The biggest trade of the offseason took place in June, 1963, with the New York Rangers and the Montreal Canadiens swapping starting goaltenders. Ranger Gump Worsley went to Montreal, along with Dave Balon, Leon Rochefort and minor-leaguer Len Ronson, for six-time Vezina Trophy winner Jacques Plante – whose relationship with Canadiens' coach Toe Blake had seriously soured – along with Don Marshall and Phil Goyette. Among other noteworthy transactions was the Boston Bruins drafting former Norris Trophy winner Tom Johnson from Montreal. Howie Young of the Red Wings, who'd likewise worn out his welcome in Detroit, was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks for goaltender Roger Crozier, who would make an immediate impact in Detroit. Billy Reay, the former coach of the Maple Leafs who had been coaching the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League, was named coach of the Black Hawks, a position he would hold for a record thirteen seasons.\n\n[10] Cy Seymour: As there were no full-time base coaches at the time, players took turns in the role. While coaching at third base, Seymour tackled teammate Moose McCormick as he rounded third base and headed for home plate, in an attempt to keep McCormick at third. McCormick overpowered Seymour and scored. When McGraw asked why, Seymour made an excuse about having the sun in his eyes. This led McGraw, now realizing the need for a full-time coach, to hire Arlie Latham for the role, the first full-time coach in MLB. Seymour got into an altercation with Latham in March 1909 at the team's hotel, prompting McGraw to seek a buyer for Seymour. Seymour apologized to McGraw, who responded by suspending Seymour for eight weeks. However, Seymour injured his right leg in his first game back from the suspension. This injury limited his effectiveness for the rest of his career. As a part-time player that season, he batted .311, best among NL reserves. He again played a reserve role for the Giants in 1910, batting .265 in 79 games.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was first published in Dutch (as \"De wilde getallen\") in 1998 and an English translation appeared in 2000. Through this work the author is trying to provide insights to the workings of a mathematics-obsessed mind. It is the story of a professor of mathematics who believes he has solved one of the great problems of mathematics -- \"Beauregard's Wild Number Problem\". In the imaginary settings of the novel, the problem is presented as a real mathematical problem seeking a solution and not as a delusion of the protagonist. But in the real mathematical world, there is no such problem; it is a fictitious problem created by the author of the book.\n\n[2] The Wild Numbers: The novel is presented as a narration by the protagonist, Isaac Swift, of the story. Isaac Swift is an able, though not brilliant, mathematics professor in a small college in an unnamed city in an unnamed country. When the novel opens Swift is in his mid-thirties and desperately trying to establish himself as a mathematician. A respected senior faculty of the mathematics department of the college has just given his seal of approval to Isaac's paper describing a proof of the wild number problem. Isaac hoped that he would soon be famous and interviewed and feted. Immediately a crisis developed as Swift was accused of plagiarising a proof of the problem already discovered by an older student, Leonard Vale. Vale's accusation was generally ignored because of his cranky behaviour in the department and his tendency to make tall claims on unsolved problems.\n\n[3] Wild number: Originally, wild numbers are the numbers supposed to belong to a fictional sequence of numbers imagined to exist in the mathematical world of the mathematical fiction \"The Wild Numbers\" authored by Philibert Schogt, a Dutch philosopher and mathematician. Even though Schogt has given a definition of the wild number sequence in his novel, it is couched in a deliberately imprecise language that the definition turns out to be no definition at all. However, the author claims that the first few members of the sequence are 11, 67, 2, 4769, 67. Later, inspired by this wild and erratic behaviour of the fictional wild numbers, American mathematician J. C. Lagarias used the terminology to describe a precisely defined sequence of integers which shows somewhat similar wild and erratic behaviour. Lagaria's wild numbers are connected with the Collatz conjecture and the concept of the 3\"x\" + 1 semigroup. The original fictional sequence of wild numbers has found a place in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.\n\n[4] Wild number: The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) has an entry with the identifying number relating to the wild numbers. According to OEIS, \"apparently these are completely fictional and there is no mathematical explanation\". However, the OEIS has some entries relating to pseudo-wild numbers carrying well-defined mathematical explanations.\n\n[5] Michael Wilding (writer): There have been a number of selections from these volumes, including \"The Man of Slow Feeling\", \"Book of the Reading\" and \"Great Climate\", published in the US as \"Her Most Bizarre Sexual Experience\". This was described as 'Erotic, fiercely intelligent and mordantly funny,' by Janette Turner Hospital. Jim Crace wrote 'His stories subvert and transcend not only sexual and social conventions... but story-telling itself.' And J. P. Donleavy commented: '21st century writing for 21st-century people.' Of the selection \"Somewhere New\", Don Graham wrote: 'What strikes one first, apart from the impressive merits of individual stories, is Wilding's keen sense of literary integrity. Without being self-important or pretentious, Wilding's voice in these stories is always one to attend to: an ironic, witty, highly educated, and in its indirect way, passionate authorial persona who has believed in literature as a life of principle, has seen many of the bases of that belief assaulted by abstruse theory, trendy anti-realism, and sinecure-seeking cynicism, and yet still in the face of everything, is able to make the affirming act through the agency of fiction. ... No one in English writes better fiction about the process of writing than Wilding.' 'Essential reading,' wrote Robert Yeo, in the \"Singapore Straits Times\".\n\n[6] Philosophy of mathematics: Having shown how to do science without using numbers, Field proceeded to rehabilitate mathematics as a kind of useful fiction. He showed that mathematical physics is a conservative extension of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like is just as fictitious as \"Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street\"—but both are true according to the relevant fictions.\n\n[7] TBD Science Fiction Story Award: TBD (Turkish Informatics Association) Science Fiction Story Contest is the only institutionalized contest in the area of science fiction story in Turkey since its foundation in 1998. The contest specification is posted every April on www.tbd.org.tr or www.bilisimdergisi.org. The award ceremony is held every autumn during the Information Convention in Ankara, Turkey. The contest strives to arouse interest in science fiction in young writers with potential, seek answers for “what have we been, what have we become, what will we be?” and raise the number of Works in Turkish science fiction. So as to awaken more interest, TBD also organizes a “guess the winner story” contest. The number of contest participants between 1998-2011 have been over 1500.\n\n[8] Wild number: Even though the sequence of wild numbers is entirely fictional, several mathematicians have tried to find rules that would generate the sequence of the fictional wild numbers. All these attempts have resulted in failures. However, in the process, certain new sequences of integers were created having similar wild and erratic behavior. These well-defined sequences are referred to as sequences of pseudo-wild numbers. A good example of this is the one discovered by the Dutch mathematician Floor van Lamoen. This sequence is defined as follows:\n\n[9] The Wild Fields: The Wild Fields () is a film based on Serhiy Zhadan’s novel “Voroshylovhrad”. Its genre is eastern.

Its type strain is NRRL NRS-213. \"B. atrophaeus\" strains have been used extensively in biomedicine as indicator strains for heat- and chemical-based decontamination regimens. Most of the strains in use are derivatives of a lineage of \"B. atrophaeus\" that originated at Camp Detrick in the 1950s, where many modern biocontainment procedures were developed. \"B. atrophaeus\" has historically been known by several other names, including \"B. globigii\" (the origin of its military moniker \"BG\") and \"B. subtilis var. niger\". Modern phylogenetic analyses using multiple genetic methods have placed \"B. atrophaeus\" close to \"B. subtilis\". Its original and still most prominent use is as a surrogate organism for pathogenic \"B. anthracis\", beginning in the U.S. bio-weapons program, as its pigmentation readily facilitated discrimination from non-pigmented background organisms in environmental samples. Subsequent genomic and phenotypic analysis of strains derived from the Camp Detrick isolates revealed that they had been deliberately selected for strains that exhibited elevated rates of sporulation.\n\n[2] Staphylococcus aureus: Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive, round-shaped bacterium that is a member of the Firmicutes, and it is a usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen. Although \"S. aureus\" usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota it can also become an opportunistic pathogen, being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of \"S. aureus\" such as methicillin-resistant \"S. aureus\" (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development, no vaccine for \"S. aureus\" has been approved.\n\n[3] Bacillus anthracis: Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax—a common disease of livestock and, occasionally, of humans—and the only obligate pathogen within the genus \"Bacillus\". \"B. anthracis\" is a Gram-positive, endospore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, with a width of 1.0–1.2 µm and a length of 3–5 µm. It can be grown in an ordinary nutrient medium under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. It is one of few bacteria known to synthesize a protein capsule (poly-D-gamma-glutamic acid). Like \"Bordetella pertussis\", it forms a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase exotoxin known as anthrax edema factor, along with anthrax lethal factor. It bears close genotypical and phenotypical resemblance to \"Bacillus cereus\" and \"Bacillus thuringiensis\". All three species share cellular dimensions and morphology. All form oval spores located centrally in an unswollen sporangium. \"B. anthracis\" endospores, in particular, are highly resilient, surviving extremes of temperature, low-nutrient environments, and harsh chemical treatment over decades or centuries.\n\n[4] Bacillus aminovorans: Bacillus aminovorans is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped species of bacteria. Samples of this species have been isolated from dust above the Atlantic Ocean. Though phenotypically similar to the species \"Sporosarcina globispora\" (formerly \"Bacillus globisporus\"), \"Bacillus marinus\", and \"Bacillus insolitus\", \"B. aminovorans\" is the only one of these species capable of using sucrose as a sole carbon source.\n\n[5] Bacillus: Bacillus (Latin \"stick\") is a genus of Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria, a member of the phylum Firmicutes, with 266 named species. The term is also used to describe the shape (rod) of certain bacteria; and the plural \"Bacilli\" is the name of the class of bacteria to which this genus belongs. \"Bacillus\" species can be either obligate aerobes: oxygen dependent; or facultative anaerobes: having the ability to be anaerobic in the absence of oxygen. Cultured \"Bacillus\" species test positive for the enzyme catalase if oxygen has been used or is present\n\n[6] List of antibiotic-resistant bacteria: \"Staphylococcus aureus\" is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the mucous membranes and the human skin of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which penicillin resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. Methicillin was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by oxacillin because of significant kidney toxicity. Methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now \"quite common\" in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of sepsis in the UK in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all \"S. aureus\" infections in the US are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, tetracycline and erythromycin.\n\n[7] Bacillus flexus: \"Bacillus flexus\" is an aerobic, Gram-variable, rod-shaped, endospore-forming, oxidase positive bacteria. The endospores are ellipsoidal, located in central/paracentral, unswollen sporangia. In laboratory conditions, it produces opaque, creamish, raised margin colonies at 30  when incubated at 24–72 hrs. on Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA). These bacteria may be isolated from feces (poultry) and soil.\n\n[8] Bacillus clausii: Bacillus clausii is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, motile and spore-forming bacterium that lives in the soil. It is classified as probiotic microorganism that maintains a symbiotic relationship with the host organism. It is currently being studied in respiratory infections and some gastrointestinal disorders. \"Bacillus clausii\", has been found to produce antimicrobial substances that are active against gram positive bacteria including \"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"Enterococcus faecium\", and \"Clostridium difficile\". It is sold by Sanofi as Enterogermina.\n\n[9] Bacillus cereus: Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, motile, beta-hemolytic bacterium commonly found in soil and food. Some strains are harmful to humans and cause foodborne illness, while other strains can be beneficial as probiotics for animals. It is the cause of \"fried rice syndrome\", as the bacteria are classically contracted from fried rice dishes that have been sitting at room temperature for hours. \"B. cereus\" bacteria are facultative anaerobes, and like other members of the genus \"Bacillus\", can produce protective endospores. Its virulence factors include cereolysin and phospholipase C.\n\n[10] Bacillus aerophilus: Bacillus aerophilus is a species of bacteria first isolated from cryogenic tubes used for collecting air samples from high altitudes, hence its name. Its type strain is 28K (=MTCC 7304 =JCM 13347).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Darwins's On the Origin of Species came out in 1859, but he did not elucidate the theory of evolution as it applies to man until the Descent of Man in 1871. Meanwhile, Wallace read a paper in 1864 to the Anthropological Society of London that was a major influence on Sir John, publishing in the very next year. He quoted Wallace:From the moment when the first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear was formed to assist in the chase, the first seed sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution was effected in nature, a revolution which in all the previous ages of the world's history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe,—a being who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how to control and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony with her, not by a change in body, but by an advance in mind. Wallace distinguishing between mind and body was asserting that natural selection shaped the form of man only until the appearance of mind; after then, it played no part. Mind formed modern man, meaning that result of mind, culture. Its appearance overthrew the laws of nature. Wallace used the term \"grand revolution.\" Although Lubbock believed that Wallace had gone too far in that direction he did adopt a theory of evolution combined with the revolution of culture. Neither Wallace not Lubbock offered any explanation of how the revolution came about, or felt that they had to offer one. Revolution is an\n\n[2] The Theory of Evolution: The Theory of Evolution is a book by English evolutionary biologist and geneticist John Maynard Smith, originally published in 1958 in time for 150th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and the centenary of the publication of \"The Origin of Species\" the following year. It serves as a general introduction to the eponymous subject, intended to be accessible to those with little technical knowledge of the area. It has been highly successful, considered by many as the definitive publication of its type. The original version was updated several times, and a \"Canto\" edition, with a foreword by Richard Dawkins, and newly written introduction by the author, was published in 1996.\n\n[3] Charles Darwin: \"On the Origin of Species\" proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859. In the book, Darwin set out \"one long argument\" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections. In making the case for common descent, he included evidence of homologies between humans and other mammals. Having outlined sexual selection, he hinted that it could explain differences between human races. He avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; \"Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\" His theory is simply stated in the introduction: At the end of the book he concluded that: The last word was the only variant of \"evolved\" in the first five editions of the book. \"Evolutionism\" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development, and Darwin first used the word evolution in \"The Descent of Man\" in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of \"The Origin of Species\".\n\n[4] On the Origin of Species: On the Origin of Species (or more completely, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life), published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the \"Beagle\" expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.\n\n[5] Donald A. Yerxa: Yerxa has written encyclopedia entries for four encyclopedias on United States history and the history of science, and is the author of three books, two on naval history: \"Admirals and Empire,\" and \"The Burning of Falmouth\", and \"Species of Origins: America’s Search for a Creation Story\" with coauthor Karl Giberson. \"Admirals\" was described as \"solidly researched, clearly and economically written, and intelligently conceived... a useful synthesis filling a gap in the existing literature,\" \"Species of Origins\" was widely reviewed as a uniquely even-handed and concise contribution to the scholarship on the Creation–evolution controversy in the United States.\n\n[6] On the Origin of Species: In a survey conducted by a group of academic booksellers, publishers and librarians in advance of Academic Book Week in the United Kingdom, \"On the Origin of Species\" was voted the most influential academic book ever written. It was hailed as \"the supreme demonstration of why academic books matter\" and \"a book which has changed the way we think about everything\".\n\n[7] Asa Gray: Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" on November 24, 1859. The first printing was 1,250 copies, with some having been sent to America via ship; one of those was for Gray. Gray's copy arrived just before Christmas, and he read it between Christmas and New Year's. Since there was no international copyright law at the time, Gray worked to protect the book from publishing piracy. According to American law at the time, a copyright could only be secured by an American edition being published by an American citizen, and royalties were not required to be paid to the author. Gray arranged the first American edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" and was able to negotiate royalties on Darwin's behalf. Gray took a 5%royalty from the publisher, and Darwin was so grateful for Gray's efforts that he offered Gray some of his royalties. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book \"Forms of Flowers\" (1877) to Gray, and he wrote in 1881, \"there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation I value more highly than I do yours.\" Seeing the \"unity we perceive in nature\" and law in the universe, regarding all species he felt \"that they not only \"had\" a Creator but \"have\" a Governor.\" Gray and Agassiz strongly disagreed; Agassiz was adamantly opposed to the idea of evolution, whereas Gray was a staunch supporter, believing in theistic evolution. As the debate raged over Darwin's theories, the rift between Gray and Agassiz grew deeper, and they were estranged by December 1863, when Gray was elected president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which also marked Agassiz' increasing isolation within the scientific community. Gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from the National Academy of Sciences in 1867. In late 1866\n\n[8] Aporrhais pespelecani: The specific name is often spelled \"pespelicani\" by analogy with the modern spelling of the word \"pelican\", however this is incorrect. It was not the original spelling as used by Linnaeus, the original authority of the species, which he called \"Strombus Pes pelecani\". The rules of the ICZN state that the original spelling of a species name is the correct one, even in cases where the word was originally misspelled, or is not in line with current spelling. However in this case, the specific name must now be written as one word, not two, and cannot be hyphenated.\n\n[9] On the Origin of Species: \"On the Origin of Species\" was first published on Thursday 24 November 1859, priced at fifteen shillings with a first printing of 1250 copies. The book had been offered to booksellers at Murray's autumn sale on Tuesday 22 November, and all available copies had been taken up immediately. In total, 1,250 copies were printed but after deducting presentation and review copies, and five for Stationers' Hall copyright, around 1,170 copies were available for sale. Significantly, 500 were taken by Mudie's Library, ensuring that the book promptly reached a large number of subscribers to the library. The second edition of 3,000 copies was quickly brought out on 7 January 1860, and incorporated numerous corrections as well as a response to religious objections by the addition of a new epigraph on page ii, a quotation from Charles Kingsley, and the phrase \"by the Creator\" added to the closing sentence. During Darwin's lifetime the book went through six editions, with cumulative changes and revisions to deal with counter-arguments raised. The third edition came out in 1861, with a number of sentences rewritten or added and an introductory appendix, \"An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin of Species\", while the fourth in 1866 had further revisions. The fifth edition, published on 10 February 1869, incorporated more changes and for the first time included the phrase \"survival of the fittest\", which had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his \"Principles of Biology\" (1864).\n\n[10] D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson: Thompson's most famous work, \"On Growth and Form\" led the way for the scientific explanation of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns and body structures are formed in plants and animals. It was written in Dundee, mostly in 1915, though wartime shortages and his many last-minute alterations delayed publication until 1917. The central theme of the book is that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics.  He had previously criticized Darwinism in his paper \"Some Difficulties of Darwinism\" in an 1884 meeting for the British Association for the Advancement of Science. \"On Growth and Form\" explained in detail why he believed Darwinism to be an inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form. Instead, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with a hint that vitalism was the unseen driving force.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The most famous is the first line in George Orwell’s \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" when it starts with, \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen\". The famous children's book \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" by Philippa Pearce speaks of this phenomenon when it says \"When Tom hears old Mrs Bartholomew's grandfather clock in the hall striking thirteen, he goes to investigate\". Thomas Hardy's \"Far from the Madding Crowd\" (1874) 'This supreme instance of Troy's goodness fell upon Gabriel's ears like the thirteenth stroke of a crazy clock' (Chapter XXIX, Particulars of a twilight walk)\n\n[3] Spring Storm: The play's original title was \"April is the Cruelest Month,\" which was also the opening line from T. S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land.\" When Williams presented \"Spring Storm\" to his playwriting class in April 1938, he wrote in his diary that the class, \"Read the final version of my second act and it was finally, quite, quite finally rejected by the class because of Heavenly's weakness as a character. Of course, it is very frightening and discouraging to work on a thing and then have it fall flat.

Le Guin, named after a line from A. E. Housman's \"A Shropshire Lad\" and first published by Harper & Row in 1975. Described by Le Guin as a retrospective, it collects 17 previously published stories, four of which were the germ of novels she was to write later: \"The Word of Unbinding\" and \"The Rule of Names\" gave Le Guin the place that was to become Earthsea; \"Semley's Necklace\" was first published as \"Dowry of the Angyar\" in 1964 and then as the Prologue of the novel \"Rocannon's World\" in 1966; \"Winter's King\" is about the inhabitants of the planet Winter, as is Le Guin's later novel \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". Most of the other stories are also connected to Le Guin's novels. The story \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas\" won the Hugo Award in 1974, while \"The Day Before the Revolution\" won the Locus and Nebula Awards in 1975.\n\n[5] To Autumn: On 19 September 1819, Keats walked near Winchester along the River Itchen. In a letter to his friend John Hamilton Reynolds written on 21 September, Keats described the impression the scene had made upon him and its influence on the composition of \"To Autumn\": \"How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik'd stubble fields so much as now [...] Somehow a stubble plain looks warm – in the same way that some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my sunday's walk that I composed upon it.\" Not everything on Keats's mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon \"Hyperion\". Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem. Keats did not send \"To Autumn\" to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, Keats's publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.\n\n[6] Winesburg, Ohio: According to Anderson's account, the first of the stories that became \"Winesburg, Ohio\" (probably \"The Book of the Grotesque\") was composed, on the spur of the moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at in Chicago: \"...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while I worked in the advertising office...\" Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the \"Winesburg, Ohio\" stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.\n\n[7] Odds On: As in many other Crichton novels the chapters are named by date as in a diary, rather than by number or other content. In this particular novel the chapters reflect the total timespan, the ticking clock, of the plot as a whole. The fifteen chapters begins with \"Saturday, June Fourteenth\", and ending with \"Afternoon, June Twenty-Second\". The timespan of the story is just a little more than a week, which is yet another similarity to Crichton’s later novels.\n\n[8] Elizabeth Cadell: In 1950, she published the humorous ghost story, \"Brimstone in the Garden\". Elsa J. Radcliffe wrote in \"Gothic Novels of the Twentieth Century\" (1979) that the ghost in the novel was \"one of the most amusing ghosts it has been my pleasure to meet.\" Cadell's next novel, \"Enter Mrs. Belchamber\" (1951), told the story of a young man who needs to rely on the help of the \"grim\" Mrs. Belchamber. \"Spring Green\" (1953) was called by \"The Observer\" an \"unexpectedly good light romance of gentry, and Americans, love and mystery, in a remote English village.\" The \"Marshfield News-Herald\" called \"Crystal Clear\" (1953), a book that \"belongs in the category of English feminine comedy.\" \"Around the Rugged Rock\" (1954) is set in Andalusia and is a light comedic romance. \"Money to Burn\" (1955) was reviewed by Virginia Jones for the \"Paducah Sun\", who said, \"If you want to start the New Year off in a spirit of utter good humor, read \"Money to Burn.\" Jones later reviewed \"The Lark Shall Sing\" (1955) and described it as a fun, easy read. This novel was adapted for an episode of NBC Matinee Theater in 1956. \"Shadows on the Water\" (1957) is a murder mystery set in Lisbon.\n\n[9] Autumn (Smith novel): In the \"Financial Times\", Alex Preston wrote: \"The first of a quartet of season-themed novels, it begins with the Brexit vote and spools forwards in time (and backwards, and sideways, as is Smith's wont) towards November 2016. I looked up at one point when I was reading, and realised that the time of the novel had just overtaken real-world time. It’s a brilliant and unsettling conceit, leaving you marvelling that writing this good could have come so fast.\" He acknowledged that, \"Autumn is a novel of ideas, and plot isn’t the reason we keep turning the pages. What grips the reader is the way that Smith draws us deeper into Elisabeth’s world […] and the way the amiable, big-hearted Daniel triangulates and illuminates these lives.\" Preston concluded by saying, \"I can think of few writers — Virginia Woolf is one, James Salter another — so able to propel a narrative through voice alone. Smith’s use of free indirect discourse, the close-third-person style that puts the reader at once within and without her characters, means that Autumn, for all its braininess, is never difficult. […] This is a novel that works by accretion, appearing light and playful, surface-dwelling, while all the time enacting profound changes on the reader’s heart. In a country apparently divided against itself, a writer such as Smith, who makes you feel known, who seems to speak to your own private weirdnesses, is more valuable than a whole parliament of politicians.\"\n\n[10] E. B. C. Jones: Jones's novels deal with World War I, its immediate aftermath, and its effects on Britain's educated classes, exploring relationships among the young in the changed wartime and post-war worlds. \"Quiet Interior\" is set during the War, the plot revolving around the relationship between two sisters, Claire and Pauline Norris, and their romantic entanglement with a man named Clement. \"The Singing Captives\" is set in 1920 and examines the War's destructive consequences for a well-to-do family. \"The Wedgwood Medallion\" moves on from the War, focusing on an engaged couple who discover their incompatibility, triggering events that draw in their families and friends. \"Inigo Sandys\" begins in Cambridge University after the War, where the eponymous protagonist struggles with the first of three doomed relationships. Several characters from \"Quiet Interior\" reappear in this novel. \"Helen and Felicia\" and \"Morning and Cloud\" examine love and marriage among the cultivated middle-class young in the later Twenties. All six novels, to some degree, are studies in compatibility and incompatibility – Jones's central theme.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The Chilean currency is the Chilean peso (CLP). Chile is one of South America's most stable and prosperous nations, leading Latin American nations in human development, competitiveness, income per capita, globalization, economic freedom, and low perception of corruption. Since July 2013, Chile is considered by the World Bank as a \"high-income economy\".\n\n[2] List of currencies in the Americas: The Brazilian real is considered a strong South American currency; under presidents Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff, the real almost tripled in value, resulting in a vast change in economics, with many people who were middle class benefiting greatly. The minimum wage was raised, and Brazil's position as a leading exporter of raw materials, including soya beans and iron ore was underlined, but they are responsible for Brazil's improved economy, which damaged the \"competitiveness of manufacturing\", reducing the amount of exports.\n\n[3] Union of South American Nations: The Bank of the South (Portuguese: Banco do Sul, Spanish: Banco del Sur, Dutch: Bank van het Zuiden, English: Bank of the South) will establish monetary policy and finance development projects. One of the objectives of monetary union is to establish a Single South American currency. Support for the creation of this currency was provided in January 2007 by Peruvian President Alan García, and other South American authorities expressed themselves in favor, as Bolivian President Evo Morales in April of that year, who proposed that the currency Only one denominated \"Pacha\" (\"earth\" in Quechua language), however, except for the right of each country to suggest a name for the common currency.\n\n[4] Single South American currency: The single South American currency was a hypothetical united currency for South America. It was proposed by the leaders of several countries, and would have been issued by the Bank of the South to the members of the Union of South American Nations.\n\n[5] Currency of Spanish America: This article provides an outline of the currency of Spanish America (\"las Indias\", the Indies) from Spanish colonization in the 15th century until Spanish American independencies in the 19th. This great realm was divided into the Viceroyalty of New Spain (capital: Mexico City), which came to include all Spanish territory north of Panama, the West Indies, Venezuela, and the Philippines, and the Viceroyalty of Peru (capital: Lima), which included Panama and all Spanish territory in South America except Venezuela. The monetary system of Spanish America, originally identical to that of Spain, soon diverged and took on a distinctive character of its own, which it passed on to the independent nations that followed after.\n\n[6] Peruvian sol: Because of the bad state of economy and hyperinflation in the late 1980s, the government was forced to abandon the inti and introduce the sol as the country's new currency. The new currency was put into use on July 1, 1991, by Law No. 25,295, to replace the inti at a rate of 1 sol to 1,000,000 intis. Coins denominated in the new unit were introduced on October 1, 1991, and the first banknotes on November 13, 1991. Since that time, the sol has retained an inflation rate of 1.5%, the lowest ever in either South America or Latin America as a whole. Since the new currency was put into effect, it has managed to maintain a stable exchange rate between 2.2 and 3.66 per United States dollar.\n\n[7] List of currencies in the Americas: A commonly used currency in the Americas is the United States dollar. It is the world's largest reserve currency, the resulting economic value of which benefits the U.S. at over $100 billion annually. However, its position as a reserve currency damages American exporters because this increases the value of the United States dollar. The United States dollar is also \"standard\" in international commodity markets. In the phenomenon known as 'dollarization', the U.S. dollar has been adopted as the official currency of several other countries. However, semi-dollarization also exists in a few other countries where the U.S. dollar is recognised as legal tender alongside another currency, and unofficial dollarization exists in many areas where the U.S. dollar is widely used and accepted-although it is not recognised as legal tender. Ecuador uses the United States dollar (the French overseas department French Guiana uses the euro, the currency of France).\n\n[8] Central banks and currencies of the Americas: This is a list of central banks and currencies of the Americas (Central America and South America and North America) .\n\n[9] SUCRE: The SUCRE is named after Antonio José de Sucre, a leading figure in Latin America's independence struggle. Agreement in general terms for the currency was declared in 2009. The formal treaty establishing the regional payments clearinghouse was signed by the six Latin American presidents in Cochabamba, Bolivia, on October 17, 2009. (The former currency of Ecuador, one of the SUCRE's users, was also called the sucre, but was abandoned and replaced by the US dollar after the economic crisis in 1999).\n\n[10] Currency of Uruguay: Banco de la República was not only the government bank, acting as a central bank with a monopoly of issue, it was also the largest commercial bank in Uruguay. A law of 14 August 1935 made its issue department (\"El Departmento de Emisión\") autonomous, and provided for a revaluation of the Bank's metallic reserves by confirming (16 August) the official exchange rate at 12.06 French francs to the peso. The old theoretical \"peso oro\" of 1.697 g, .917 fine, was abandoned, and bank notes were denominated in national currency (\"moneda nacional\"). The Bank's gold stocks were revalued by a factor of 2.2 (i.e., at 709.53 mg fine gold to the peso). The actual market rate in New York ranged US$0.46-0.57 per peso during 1936.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know."}}

Garrity Jr.: Robert T. Garrity, Jr. (born March 23, 1949), is a lawyer in Harahan, Louisiana, who is a Republican former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for suburban District 78 in Jefferson Parish. He served from 1988 to 1992 during the administration of Governor Buddy Roemer. In the nonpartisan blanket primary held in October 1987, Garrity was placed into a runoff with the incumbent Republican representative, Eddie Doucet, a former Democrat first elected in 1972. Garrity led with 6,197 votes (48.2 percent) in a four-candidate field; Doucet, who sought a fifth term, trailed with 5,348 (41.6 percent). Two other candidates, both Democrats, held the remaining 10 percent of the votes in the heavily Republican district. One of those candidates was former state Representative Clyde F. Bel Jr., of Orleans Parish. In the second round of balloting, called the general election in Louisiana even though both candidates were of the same party, Garrity prevailed, 6,106 (53 percent) to Doucet's 5,407 (47 percent). In October 1991, Garrity was unseated after one term by fellow Republican Shirley D. Bowler, 8,986 votes (59.3 percent) to 6,167 (40.7 percent).\n\n[2] Eddie Doucet: Doucet sought a fifth term in the nonpartisan blanket primary held in October 1987. In a time prior to term limits for the state legislature, Doucet was placed into a runoff with fellow Republican Robert T. Garrity, Jr., a lawyer from Harahan. Doucet had been a Republican for less than two years at the time. Garrity led with 6,197 votes (48.2 percent) in a four-candidate field; Doucet followed with 5,348 (41.6 percent). Two other candidates, both Democrats, one of whom was former State Representative Clyde F. Bel, Jr., of Orleans Parish, held the remaining 10 percent of the ballots in the since heavily Republican district. In the second round of balloting, called the general election in Louisiana even though both candidates were of the same party, Garrity prevailed, 6,106 (53 percent) to Doucet's 5,407 (47 percent). Doucet failed in a comeback attempt in 1999, when he was one of three Republicans crushed by incumbent District 78 Republican Representative Shirley D. Bowler.\n\n[3] W. Arthur Garrity Jr.: Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, Garrity received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from College of the Holy Cross in 1941, and was then a Sergeant in the United States Army during World War II, from 1943-45. He received a Bachelor of Laws from Harvard Law School in 1946, and served as a law clerk to Francis Ford of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1946 to 1947. Garrity entered private practice in Boston and Worcester from 1947 to 1948. He was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts from 1948 to 1950, lecturing in federal jurisdiction and procedure at Boston College Law School from 1950 to 1951. He was in private practice in Boston from 1951 to 1961. He was the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts from 1961 to 1966.\n\n[4] W. Arthur Garrity Jr.: Garrity was nominated by President Lyndon B. Johnson on May 23, 1966, to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 24, 1966, and received his commission on June 24, 1966. He assumed senior status on December 1, 1985. His service terminated on September 16, 1999, due to his death of cancer in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\n[5] Robert T. Garrity Jr.: In 1999, Garrity ran unsuccessfully for the District 5 seat on the Jefferson Parish Council. He was defeated by fellow Republican John Lavarine, 8,559 (58.6 percent) to 6,053 (41.2 percent). Lavarine was succeeded in 2004 by Jennifer Sneed Heebe, a former District 81 state House member.\n\n[6] W. Arthur Garrity Jr.: As a remedy, he used a busing plan developed by the Massachusetts State Board of Education to implement the state's Racial Imbalance Law that had been passed by the Massachusetts state legislature a few years earlier, requiring any school with a student enrollment that was more than 50% white to be balanced according to race. The Boston School Committee consistently disobeyed orders from the state Board of Education. Garrity's ruling, upheld on appeal by conservative judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and by the Supreme Court led by Warren Burger, required school children to be brought to different schools to end segregation and led to the Boston busing crisis of 1974-88. By the final Garrity-decided court case in 1988, Garrity had assumed more control over a school system than any judge in American history.\n\n[7] Guy Gillette: In 1932, in the Roosevelt landslide, he was elected as a Democrat to represent Iowa's 9th congressional district, in heavily Republican northwest Iowa. He was re-elected in 1934, and served nearly all of that term. He resigned upon his election to the United States Senate on November 3, 1936 to serve out the remainder of the term of Senator Richard Louis Murphy, who had died in an auto accident. Nearly two years remained in Murphy's term, which would end January 3, 1939. Although he generally supported the New Deal, he opposed the new wage and hours bill, a new farm bill, and aspects of the Social Security system.\n\n[8] Hank Garrity (coach): Martin Henry Garrity Jr. (January 30, 1900 – August 30, 1972) was an American football and baseball player, coach of football, basketball, and baseball, and college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Wake Forest University from 1923 to 1925, compiling a record of 19–7–1. Garrity was also the head basketball coach at Wake Forest from 1923 to 1925, tallying a mark of 33–14. He served as the head baseball coach at the University of Missouri in 1923 and at Wake Forest from 1924 to 1925.\n\n[9] Libby Garvey: In 1999 Garvey was elected to the Arlington County's Board of Education and served for 15 (non-consecutive) years. During that time, she served as chairwoman five times. Robert G. Smith, who served as the Board's most senior administrator for most of her tenure, described a key exchange they had when he was being interviewed for the job of supervisor. He said they discussed the common attitude that those students coming from an impoverished family background, were predetermined to have low academic performance. In a book Smith wrote, describing how he turned around the County's student's academic performance, he described Garvey challenging him to disprove the common misconception.\n\n[10] W. Arthur Garrity Jr.: Opposition to desegregation exploded in some areas, particularly the largely Irish Catholic enclaves of Charlestown and South Boston, and spilled over into racial violence. Garrity became the target of death threats and at least two attempts on his life. He remained under guard 24 hours a day from 1974-78. He was scorned and snubbed by many; his name appeared in profane city graffiti; he was hanged in effigy, and demonstrators came to his home.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

He titled an 1894 self-portrait in plaster as \"Oviri\". The original is lost but a number of bronze casts survive. He used double mirrors to capture his familiar Inca profile, the result reprising his \"Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait\". This was one of the earliest occasions Gauguin applied the term \"Oviri\" to himself. \"Gauguin sometimes also referred to himself as Oviri, the savage ...\", writes . The Stuttgart version of his 1892 oil painting \"E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?)\" depicts a woman clutching a wolf cub. Pollitt remarks that this stocky, sculptural and androgynous figure gives a first glimpse of \"Oviri\".\n\n[2] Oviri: Oviri (Tahitian for savage or wild) is an 1894 ceramic sculpture by the French artist Paul Gauguin. In Tahitian mythology, Oviri was the goddess of mourning. She is shown with long pale hair, and wild eyes, smothering a wolf with her feet, while clutching a cub in her arms. Art historians have presented multiple interpretations—usually that Gauguin intended it as an epithet to reinforce his self-image as a \"civilised savage\". Tahitian goddesses of her era had passed from folk memory by 1894, yet Gauguin romanticises the island's past as he reaches towards more ancient sources, including an Assyrian relief of a \"master of animals\" type, and Majapahit mummies. Other possible influences include preserved skulls from the Marquesas Islands, figures found at Borobudur, and a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple in central Java.\n\n[3] Oviri: Gauguin depicts the \"Oviri\" figure in at least one drawing, two watercolour transfer monotypes and two woodcuts. It is possible that the woodcuts were created in Pont-Aven in the summer of 1894; before the ceramic. The last to appear is probably the drawing in what is apparently the first issue of Gauguin's Papeete broadsheet \"Le Sourire\" \"(The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)\" published between August 1899 and April 1900. It was accompanied by the inscription \"Et le monstre, entraînant sa créature, féconde de sa semence des flancs généreux pour engendrer Séraphitus-Séraphita\" (\"And the monster, embracing its creation, filled her generous womb with seed and fathered Séraphitus-Séraphita\"). Séraphitus-Séraphita is an allusion to Honoré de Balzac's novel \"Séraphîta\" which features an androgynous hero. In this first issue of \"Le Sourire\", he reviewed a local Maohi author's play by that dealt with incest (among other themes), and invokes 'Séraphitus-Séraphita'. The review congratulated the play's \"savage author\" and ended with a plea for women's liberation through the abolition of marriage. The accompanying drawing is distinctly androgynous.\n\n[4] Oviri: Both Sweetman and Richardson point to the Gauguin \"Oviri\" as a major influence. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was probably a direct influence on \"Les Demoiselles\". David Sweetman writes, \"Gauguin's statue \"Oviri,\" which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in printmaking, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\".\"\n\n[5] Paul Gauguin: According to Richardson, Picasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome \"Oviri.\" Until 1987, when the Musée d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the \"Demoiselles.\" Although just under 30 inches high, \"Oviri\" has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by \"Oviri.\" 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to Primitivism.\n\n[6] Oviri: Gauguin made three casts, each in partially glazed stoneware, and while several copies exist in plaster or bronze, the original cast is in the Musée d'Orsay. His sales of the casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal ebb he asked for one to be placed on his grave. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: he described the figure as a strange and cruel enigma on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of \"Oviri\" for Stéphane Mallarmé; he referred to it as \"La Tueuse\" (\"The Murderess\") in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard; and he appended an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel \"Séraphîta\" in a drawing. \"Oviri\" was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no. 57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" on it.\n\n[7] Proto-Cubism: Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin's \"Oviri\" (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 Salon d'Automne retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on \"Les Demoiselles.\" Sweetman writes, \"Gauguin's statue \"Oviri,\" which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\".\"\n\n[8] Oviri: Oviri's head seems based on mummified skulls of chieftains in the Marquesas Islands, whose eye sockets were traditionally encrusted with mother-of-pearl and worshiped as divine. Elements of her body may draw from Borobudur images of fecundity. Thus life and death were evoked in the same image. In a letter to Mallarmé trying to raise a public subscription to purchase the work, Morice titled the sculpture \"Diane Chasseresse\" (\"Diana the Huntress\"), an allusion to the ancient Greek goddess Diana of the hunt, moon and childbirth. He made the same reference in his poems on \"Oviri\". Barbara Landy interprets the life and death theme as indicating Gauguin's need to abandon his civilised ego in a return to the natural state of the primitive savage. The work is related to the 1889 ceramic \"Black Venus\", which shows a woman kneeling over a severed head resembling the artist.\n\n[9] Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Picasso's interest in stoneware was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome \"Oviri.\" Until 1987, when the Musée d'Orsay acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the \"Demoiselles.\" Although just under 30 inches high, \"Oviri\" has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave.

Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism. During the 19th and 20th centuries, Europe's colonization of Africa led to many economic, social, political, and even artistic encounters. From these encounters, Western visual artists became increasingly interested in the unique forms of African art, particularly masks from the Niger-Congo region. In an essay by Dennis Duerden, author of \"African Art\" (1968), \"The Invisible Present\" (1972), and a former director of the BBC World Service, the mask is defined as \"very often a complete head-dress and not just that part that conceals the face\". This form of visual art and image appealed to Western visual artists, leading to what Duerden calls\n\n[10] Oviri: Oviri has long blonde or grey hair reaching to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, while the aperture at the back of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, \"Medea About to Kill Her Children\". A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhere in your body is your patella?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Patellar dislocation: The patella is a triangular sesamoid bone which is embedded in tendon. It rests in the patellofemoral groove, an articular cartilage-lined hollow at the end of the thigh bone (femur) where the thigh bone meets the shin bone (tibia). Several ligaments and tendons hold the patella in place and allow it to move up and down the patellofemoral groove when the leg bends. The top of the patella attaches to the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon, the middle to the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles, and the bottom to the head of the tibia (tibial tuberosity) via the patellar tendon, which is a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon. The medial patellofemoral ligament attaches horizontally in the inner knee to the adductor magnus tendon and is the structure most often damaged during a patellar dislocation. Finally, the lateral collateral ligament and the medial collateral ligament stabilize the patella on either side. Any of these structures can sustain damage during a patellar dislocation.\n\n[2] Attenuated patella alta: A similar condition, patella alta, can occur as the result of a sports injury, though the large majority of the time it is a congenital/developmental condition that is unrelated to trauma. A kneecap in an \"alta\" position sits above the \"trochlear groove\" and therefore is less stable. The \"patellar tendon\" that connects the kneecap to the tibia (shinbone) is elongated (longer than normal). This cannot happen by way of trauma, unless there has been a rupture of the tendon and a less-than-optimal surgical repair.\n\n[3] Taenia solium: The anterior end is a knob-like attachment organ (sometimes mistakenly-referred to as a \"head\") called a scolex, 1 mm in diameter. The scolex bears four radially arranged suckers (acetabula) that surround the rostellum. These are the organs of adhesive attachment to the intestinal wall of the host. The rostellum is armed with two rows of spiny hooks, which are chitinous in nature. Its 22 to 32 rostellar hooks can be differentiated into short (130-µm) and long (180-µm) types. After a short neck is the elongated body, the strobila. The entire body is covered by a covering called tegument, which is an absorptive layer consisting of a mat of minute hair-like microtriches. The strobila is divided into segments called proglottids, 800 to 900 in number. Body growth starts from the neck region, so the oldest proglottids are at the posterior end. Thus, the three distinct proglottids are immature proglottids towards the neck, mature proglottids in the middle, and gravid proglottids at the posterior end. A monoecious species, each mature proglottid contains a set of male and female reproductive systems. The numerous testes and a bilobed ovary open into a common genital pore. The oldest gravid proglottids are full of fertilised eggs,\n\n[4] United States Army Physical Fitness Test: \"The push-up event measures the endurance of the chest, shoulder, and triceps muscles. On the command 'get set,' assume the front-leaning rest position by placing your hands where they are comfortable for you. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. When viewed from the side, your body should form a generally straight line from your shoulders to your ankles. On the command 'go,' begin the push-up by bending your elbows and lowering your entire body as a single unit until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground. Then, return to the starting position by raising your entire body until your arms are fully extended. Your body must remain rigid in a generally straight line and move as a unit while performing each repetition. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of repetitions you have completed correctly. If you fail to keep your body generally straight, to lower your whole body until your upper arms are at least parallel to the ground, or to extend your arms completely, that repetition will not count, and the scorer will repeat the number of the last correctly performed repetition.\n\n[5] Patella: The patella is found in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella. A patella is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. In more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the tibia, and a patella is not present In 2017 it was discovered that frogs have kneecaps, contrary to what was thought. This raises the possibility that the kneecap arose 400 million years ago when tetrapods first appeared, but that it disappeared in some animals.\n\n[6] Glossary of partner dance terms: Dance frames are the upper body positions of the dancers. A strong frame provides connection with your partner and conveys intended movement. A strong frame is where your arms and upper body are held firmly in place without relying on your partner to maintain your frame nor applying force that would move your partner or your partner's frame.\n\n[7] Your Body (Christina Aguilera song): Prior to its official release, an uncensored demo version of \"Your Body\" was leaked to the web on August 23, 2012, entitled \"Fuck Your Body\", where she sings \"All I wanna do is fuck your body\" in the chorus. On September 12, 2012, Aguilera revealed details about \"Lotus\" and \"Your Body\" via Twitter, including the cover artwork. RCA Records premiered the song on \"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\" on September 14, 2012. Two days later, the single was serviced to contemporary hit rhythmic radio stations in the United States. \"Your Body\" was available via iTunes Stores worldwide for digital download on September 17, 2012. It was also digitally release in the United Kingdom on November 2, 2012; three remixes of the track was purchased for on-line sales the same day. The CD single version for \"Your Body\" was released in Germany and the United States on November 9 and November 27, respectively.\n\n[8] Labia: The labia minora (obsolete: nymphae), also called inner labia or inner lips, are two soft folds of fat-free, hairless skin between the labia majora. They enclose and protect the vulvar vestibule, urethra and vagina. The upper portion of each labium minora splits to join with both the clitoral glans, and the clitoral hood. The labia minora meet posterially at the frenulum of the labia minora (also known as the fourchette), which is a fold of skin below the vaginal orifice. The fourchette is more prominent in younger women, and often recedes after sexual activity and childbirth.  When standing or with the legs together, the labia majora usually entirely or partially cover the moist, sensitive inner surfaces of the vulva, which indirectly protects the vagina and urethra, much like the lips protect the mouth. The outer surface of the labia majora is pigmented skin, and develops pubic hair during puberty. The inner surface of the labia majora is smooth, hairless skin, which resembles a mucous membrane, and is only visible when the labia majora and labia minora are drawn apart.\n\n[9] Oral mucocele: The most common location to find a mucocele is the inner surface of the lower lip. It can also be found on the inner side of the cheek (known as the buccal mucosa), on the anterior ventral tongue, and the floor of the mouth. When found on the floor of the mouth, the mucocele is referred to as a ranula. They are rarely found on the upper lip. As their name suggests they are basically mucus lined cysts and they can also occur in the Paranasal sinuses most commonly the frontal sinuses, the frontoethmoidal region and also in the maxillary sinus. Sphenoid sinus involvement is extremely rare.  When the lumen of the vermiform appendix gets blocked due to any factor, again a mucocele can form.\n\n[10] Three Corpses: The \"Baoshengjing\" describes the \"sanhun\" 三魂 \"Three \"hun\"-souls\" in the human body and how to meditate on them.  The three spirit souls are located beneath the liver. They look like human beings and wear green robes with yellow inner garments. Every month on the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third, they leave the body at night to go wandering about. At this time, lie down with your feet up, your head supported by a pillow, and your legs stretched out straight. Fold your hands over your heart, close your eyes, and hold your breath. Clap your teeth three times. Now visualize a red energy in your heart about the size of an egg. It emerges from the heart and rises into the throat, from where it spreads a wondrous radiance that envelopes your entire body to grow into a glowing fire all around it. You should feel the body getting quite warm. At that point, call out their names: \"Spirit Guidance—come to succor me! Inner Radiance—come to nurture me! Dark Essence—come to protect my life! Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!\" (1, 7, tr. Kohn 2009: 168)\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

As AidData, it now contains records of over 900,000 international development projects financed by bilateral and multilateral donors from 1950-2010. Up until the official launch of AidData in March 2010, the PLAID database was the primary output of PLAID, a research partnership between the Institute for Theory and Practice of International Relations at the College of William and Mary, and the Political Economy and Development Lab at Brigham Young University. It was begun in 2003 to build upon the existing work of the OECD's Creditor Reporting System. In August 2009, PLAID merged with the Development Gateway's Accessible Information on Development Activities Database to form AidData. The beta version of the AidData portal was launched in March 2010, and continues to be accessible to the public.\n\n[2] AidData: AidData was formed in 2009 as a partnership between Brigham Young University (BYU), the College of William and Mary, and Development Gateway. The organization was formed through the merger of two prior initiatives: Project-Level Aid (PLAID) and Accessible Information on Development Activities (AiDA). PLAID, conceived in 2003, was a joint effort between BYU and William and Mary to provide data on foreign aid. AiDA was established in 2001 by Development Gateway to serve as a registry of aid activities to improve aid transparency and coordination. The organization released their searchable data portal of one million past and present development finance activities from over 90 funding agencies.\n\n[3] PSIPRED: The prediction method or algorithm is split into three stages: \"generating a sequence profile\", \"predicting initial secondary structure\", and \"filtering the predicted structure\". PSIPRED works to normalize the sequence profile generated by PSIBLAST. Then, by using neural networking, initial secondary structure is predicted. For each amino acid in the sequence, the neural network is fed with a window of 15 acids. Added information is attached, indicating if the window spans the N or C terminus of the chain. This results in a final input layer of 315 input units, divided into 15 groups of 21 units. The network has one hidden layer of 75 units and 3 output nodes (one for each secondary structure element: helix, sheet, coil).\n\n[4] PRISM (surveillance program): Some SIGADs, like PRISM, collect data at the ISP level, but others take it from the top-level infrastructure. This type of collection is known as \"upstream\". Upstream collection includes programs known by the blanket terms BLARNEY, FAIRVIEW, OAKSTAR and STORMBREW, under each of these are individual SIGADs. Data that is integrated into a SIGAD can be gathered in other ways besides upstream, and from the service providers, for instance it can be collected from passive sensors around embassies, or even stolen from an individual computer network in a hacking attack.\n\n[5] PID controller: The proportional and derivative terms can produce excessive movement in the output when a system is subjected to an instantaneous step increase in the error, such as a large setpoint change. In the case of the derivative term, this is due to taking the derivative of the error, which is very large in the case of an instantaneous step change. As a result, some PID algorithms incorporate some of the following modifications:The control system performance can be improved by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or \"error\" remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.\n\n[6] JADE (planning system): JADE supports the retrieval and reuse of previous plan elements for use in the development of new plans by using a map-oriented drag and drop interface. Force modules (FMs) from previous plans (cases) can be dragged from the case library and dropped onto a geographic destination. To support plan adaption of previous plans or modifications resulting from changing mission requirements, constraint checking against the knowledge base and mission goals causes automatic reminders from the system to notify the user of changes and improvements that need to be made. JADE is a mixed-initiative system, using dialog initiated by both the user (user-initiative) and by the system (system-initiative).\n\n[7] PRECEDE–PROCEED model: The PRECEDE–PROCEED model is a cost–benefit evaluation framework proposed in 1974 by Lawrence W. Green that can help health program planners, policy makers and other evaluators, analyze situations and design health programs efficiently. It provides a comprehensive structure for assessing health and quality of life needs, and for designing, implementing and evaluating health promotion and other public health programs to meet those needs. One purpose and guiding principle of the PRECEDE–PROCEED model is to direct initial attention to outcomes, rather than inputs. It guides planners through a process that starts with desired outcomes and then works backwards in the causal chain to identify a mix of strategies for achieving those objectives. A fundamental assumption of the model is the active participation of its intended audience — that is, that the participants (\"consumers\") will take an active part in defining their own problems, establishing their goals and developing their solutions.\n\n[8] PHPIDS: Furthermore, using PHPIDS as the primary means of application security will lead uninformed developers into wrongly assuming their product is safe, when this is not the case. Any well-informed developer should be taking steps internally to secure their application's codebase, and any actors on the defense side should understand Defense in depth and use multiple solutions to secure their resources. PHPIDS is not intended to be a panacea, but it does provide logging abilities well beyond the built in functionality which would exist without (inbuilt tools are limited to logging GET requests). Additionally, the output of a PHPIDS check is not a binary value, but rather an integer value, allowing a probabilistic estimate of harm instead of a black & white binary value. This allows the developer to make informed decisions per-application instead of defining a hard-and-fast rule which may inadequately address the needs of a certain application. The downside is that obviously this is imperfect as the assigned values or the cutoffs for said values may not catch all attacks.\n\n[9] Fiona Brinkman: Brinkman's current research interests center around improving understanding of how microbes evolve and improving computational methods that aid the analysis of microbes and the development of new vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for infectious diseases. Increasingly her methods have been applied for more environmental applications. She is noted for developing PSORTb, the most precise method available for computational protein subcellular localization prediction and the first computational method that exceeded the accuracy of some common high-throughput laboratory methods for such subcellular localization analysis. This method aids the prediction of cell surface and secreted proteins in a bacterial cell that may be suitable drug targets, vaccine components or diagnostics. She has also developed bioinformatics methods that aid the more accurate identification of genomic islands (i.e. IslandViewer) and orthologs (i.e. OrtholugeDB) . Her research has provided new insights into the evolution of pathogens and the role that horizontal gene transfer and genomic islands play. She confirmed the anecdotal assumption that virulence factors (disease-causing genes in pathogens) are disproportionately associated with genomic islands. She was among the first researchers to use whole genome sequencing to aid infectious disease outbreak investigations (\"genomic epidemiology\"), integrating genome sequence data with social network analysis. She was involved in the Pseudomonas Genome Project and is the coordinator of the Pseudomonas Genome Database, a database of Pseudomonas species genomic data and associated annotations that is continually updated. She has also developed databases (i.e. InnateDB and the Allergy and Asthma Portal) to aid more systems-based analysis of immune disorders and the immune response to infections in humans and other animals - databases that have aided the identification of new immune-modulating therapeutics. She has a growing interest in applying her methods to environmental applications as part of a broader interest in developing approaches for more holistic, sustainable infectious disease control and microbiome conservation - developing approaches that may select less for antim\n\n[10] PLAY Project: The PLAY Project (acronym for Play and Language for Autistic Youngsters) is a community-based, national autism training and early intervention program established in 2001 by Richard Solomon, MD. Based on the DIR (Developmental, Individualized, Relationship-based) theory of Stanley Greenspan MD, the program is designed to train parents and professionals to implement intensive, developmental interventions for young children (18 months to 6 years) with autism. The program is operating in nearly 100 agencies worldwide including 25 states and in eight countries outside the U.S. (Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, Israel, Ireland, Switzerland and the Netherlands). The PLAY Project has been operating since 2001 from its headquarters in Ann Arbor, MI.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Ottis Adams: John Ottis Adams (July 8, 1851 – January 28, 1927) was an American impressionist painter and art educator who is best known as a member of the Hoosier Group of Indiana landscape painters, along with William Forsyth, Richard B. Gruelle, Otto Stark, and T. C. Steele. In addition, Adams was among a group that formed the Society of Western Artists in 1896, and served as the organization's president in 1908 and 1909. Adams grew up in central Indiana, but received his formal art training at the South Kensington School of Art in London and spent seven years in Germany, where he attended the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich. Adams formed the Muncie Art School with Forsyth, but the school closed after two years. Adams also assisted in planning and taught art classes at the John Herron Art Institute, which later became the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis, and gave informal art lessons at the Hermitage, his studio-home near Brookville, Indiana.\n\n[2] J. Ottis Adams: John Ottis Adams was born on July 8, 1851, in Amity, Johnson County, Indiana. His parents were Elizabeth Strange and Alban Housley Adams. Because Adams's parents relocated frequently, he spent his youth in Franklin, Shelbyville, and Martinsville, Indiana. The family moved to Franklin shortly after his birth, and then to Shelbyville, where Alban worked as a local merchant and part-time farmer.\n\n[3] J. Ottis Adams: In 1894 Adams was one of the painters invited to contribute to the \"Five Hoosier Painters\" exhibition, which was sponsored by the Central Art Association in Chicago. Two of Adams's paintings, \"The Frosty Morning\" and \"October\", were exhibited at the show. The exhibition led to the five men (Adams, Forsyth, Gruelle, Stark, and Steele) being identified as the Hoosier Group of painters. Although the artists maintained their individuality, they often painted together at various sites around Indiana, especially during the period 1895 to 1900. In addition, Adams was among the group that formed the Society of Western Artists in 1896. He was a regular exhibitor at its shows from 1896 through 1914, and served as the organization's president in 1908 and 1909.\n\n[4] J. Ottis Adams: In 1901 Adams became involved in planning a new art school for the Art Association of Indianapolis. Along with a group of local citizens and other members of the Hoosier Group, they founded the John Herron School of Art, which later became the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the John Herron School of Art in Indianapolis. The art school officially opened on March 4, 1902, with Adams and Stark serving as faculty members. In addition, Adams rented studio space in downtown Indianapolis with Steele and Gruelle to exhibit their work.\n\n[5] J. Ottis Adams: In 1872 Adams left Indiana to study at the South Kensington School of Art in London. A standard part of his training, and a typical exercise for most art students in London, was to paint reproductions of the masters at the National Gallery. The experience exposed Adams to the work of landscape painters John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. Adams also worked at a London photography studio to help fund his art training. At the completion of his studies in 1873, Adams was awarded a certificate from the school and remained in London to study with John Parker, a landscape and genre painter who primarily worked in watercolor. Adams returned to the United States in late 1874 to begin his career as a painter and art educator.\n\n[6] J. Ottis Adams: On October 1, 1898, Adams married Winifred Brady, a still-life painter and one of his former art students in Muncie, Indiana. Brady, who was twenty years younger than Adams, attended Drexel Institute in Philadelphia and the Art Students League of New York. The couple had three sons: John Alban (born in 1900), Edward Wolfe (born in 1902), and Robert Brady (born in 1904).\n\n[7] The Hermitage (Brookville, Indiana): The Hermitage, also known as the John Ottis Adams and Winifred Brady Adams Home and Studio, is a historic home located at Brookville, Franklin County, Indiana. The original house was built about 1835, and reconfigured in 1898. It is a 1 1/2-story, Bungalow / American Craftsman inspired frame dwelling sheathed in clapboard. It features a full-width front porch supported by 17 tapered columns. At each end of the house are artists studios. A rear section rises to 2 1/2-stories. Also on the property are the levee built after a flood in 1913, contributing gazebo (c. 1910), pergola (c. 1910), and outhouse. It was the home of artist J. Ottis Adams (1851-1927).\n\n[8] John Adams Sr.: John Adams Sr. (February 8, 1691 – May 25, 1761) was a British colonial farmer and minister. He was the father of the second U.S. President, John Adams Jr., and grandfather of the sixth President, John Quincy Adams. He was the son of Joseph Adams Jr. (1654–1737), the grandson of Joseph Adams Sr. (1626-1694), and the great-grandson of Henry Adams, who emigrated from Braintree, Essex, in England to Massachusetts Bay Colony in about 1638. He was also descended from John and Priscilla Alden. Adams worked as a farmer and cobbler (also called a cord-wainer or shoemaker) for most of his life.\n\n[9] John Adams: John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19, 1735 – July 4, 1826) was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He served as the first vice president (1789–1797) and second president of the United States (1797–1801). He was a lawyer, diplomat, and leader of American independence from Great Britain. Adams was a dedicated diarist, and correspondent with his wife and advisor Abigail, recording important historical information on the era.\n\n[10] John Quincy Adams: John Quincy Adams (; July 11, 1767 – February 23, 1848) was an American statesman who served as the sixth president of the United States from 1825 to 1829. He served as the eighth United States secretary of state immediately before becoming president. During his long diplomatic and political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and represented Massachusetts as a United States Senator and as a member of the United States House of Representatives. He was the eldest son of John Adams, who served as president from 1797 to 1801. Initially a Federalist like his father, he won election to the presidency as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, and in the mid-1830s became affiliated with the Whig Party.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It was a rematch of the first fight between Carl Froch and George Groves in 2013, with Froch's unified WBA (Regular) and IBF super-middleweight titles at stake as before.\n\n[2] Carl Froch: On 25 April 2009, Froch fought Jermain Taylor in his first defence of his WBC super-middleweight title, at the Foxwoods Resort in Foxwoods, Connecticut. Froch survived a third-round knockdown – the first of his entire career, amateur and professional – and, behind on two of the three judges' cards coming into the final round, he managed to stop his opponent with 14 seconds remaining in the 12th round to retain his WBC super-middleweight title.\n\n[3] Carl Froch vs. Glen Johnson: Carl Froch vs. Glen Johnson was a championship fight for the WBC Super Middleweight championship. The winner of the bout is going to the Finals of the Super Six World Boxing Classic and face WBA Champion Andre Ward, after his decision win over Arthur Abraham in May 2011. It was held on June 4, 2011, at Boardwalk Hall, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States, and televised on Showtime. Froch defeated Andre Dirrell by split decision in a WBC super-middleweight title defense. A very controversial win who many believed Dirrell had won. Nevertheless, Froch got the win and the 2 points for his victory. In his second bout of the Super Six, the contestant was Danish boxer Mikkel Kessler. 31-year-old Kessler managed to take the WBC super-middleweight title from defending champ Carl in a great action fight that had some truly memorable trading, especially in the later rounds, Kessler prevailed via a unanimous decision. After the loss, Froch's next fight would be against rugged fighter Arthur Abraham. He regained his WBC Title as he dominated from start to finish to claim a unanimous point victory over Abraham in Helsinki, Finland.\n\n[4] Carl Froch vs. Mikkel Kessler II: Kessler was then forced to pull out of the Super Six due to the worsening of an eye injury that he suffered in his defeat to Ward. Meanwhile, Froch went on to defeat both Arthur Abraham and Glen Johnson on his way to meeting Ward in the final on 17 December 2011. Ward handed Froch the second defeat of his professional career with a 12-round unanimous decision to win the Super Six and unify his WBA belt with the WBC title Froch had since regained plus the vacant Ring and lineal titles.\n\n[5] Carl Froch: On 13 July 2009, Froch agreed to take part in the Super Six World Boxing Classic super-middleweight tournament devised by American giant Showtime, with the winner of the tournament winning the WBC and WBA world super-middleweight titles. The tournament featured 6 boxers including Andre Dirrell, Mikkel Kessler, Arthur Abraham, Jermain Taylor, Andre Ward and Froch. Froch's first opponent in the Super Six was Andre Dirrell.\n\n[6] Carl Froch vs. Jermain Taylor: Froch was coming off a win against Jean Pascal for the vacant WBC title whilst Jermain Taylor had only recently stepped up to super-middleweight and was also coming off a win, beating Jeff Lacy in a title eliminator. Froch was ranked lower in the Ring Magazine rankings despite being the champion and was fighting in the United States for only the second time in his career. Taylor had been taunting Froch prior to the fight, saying \"Who's Carl Froch\", referring to the fact he wasn't well known by fans.\n\n[7] Carl Froch: In November 2003, Froch fought fellow unbeaten British contender Alan Page (8-0, 4 KOs) at the Derby Storm Arena in Derby for the vacant English super-middleweight title. In round 7, Froch hit a hard right followed by an uppercut, although Page didn't go down, referee John Keane stepped in to call an end to the fight. In 2004, Froch won the Commonwealth and vacant British super middleweight championships by defeating Charles Adamu and Damon Hague respectively. He has defended both against Matthew Barney, Brian Magee and Tony Dodson and the Commonwealth belt alone against Ruben Groenewald and Dale Westerman.\n\n[8] Carl Froch: Froch's next fight was against Mikkel Kessler, who lost the WBA super-middleweight title to Andre Ward. Froch's WBC title was again on the line. In a closely fought contest in Kessler's home country of Denmark where both men had great moments throughout the fight, Kessler took Froch's title and inflicted Froch's first professional defeat via unanimous decision, the judges scoring the contest by margins of 116–112, 115–113 and 117–111. The scoring was somewhat controversial, as some boxing announcers had scored the fight much closer, with some awarding Froch the win and others scoring it a draw. Froch later stated that the fight was close and that he believes the decision would have gone his way if the event had been held in Nottingham. The fight was a contender for the 2010 Fight of the Year.\n\n[9] Carl Froch vs. George Groves: Carl Froch began 2013 by successfully defending his IBF super-middleweight title against WBA (Regular) champion Mikkel Kessler on 25 May, which was a rematch of their first fight on 24 April 2010, at the time part of the Super Six World Boxing Classic tournament. Having unified the titles and become a two-time world champion, Froch considered several options for his next fight. His preference was a third fight with Kessler, based on the resounding critical success of the second, as well as a rematch with former Super Six rival Andre Ward, who defeated Froch in the tournament final on 17 December 2011.\n\n[10] Carl Froch vs. Jean Pascal: In 2008, after Joe Calzaghe had moved up in weight to challenge Bernard Hopkins, his WBC super middleweight title became vacant. This meant that challengers Carl Froch and Jermain Taylor were in line to fight for the vacant title. However, Taylor opted to fight former IBF champion Jeff Lacy instead, which meant Jean Pascal would challenge Froch for the title on 8 December 2008. Both men went into the fight with an unbeaten record, but this would be their toughest test to date.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The album peaked at No. 4 in the US, and became a worldwide hit. The primary studio musicians were Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman (of The Hooters), Rick Chertoff, Richard Termini and Peter Wood. Lauper became popular with teenagers and critics, in part due to her hybrid punk image, which was crafted by stylist Patrick Lucas. Lauper was interested in writing her own songs, but the record company provided her with songs to record that were written by other writers. Lauper sometimes changed the lyrics in the material she was given by the record company; such is the case with \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\". Lauper found the original lyrics to be misogynistic, so she rewrote the song as an anthem for young women.\n\n[2] Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song): While writing for her debut studio album, in the spring of 1983, Cyndi Lauper was introduced to American musician Rob Hyman, who was recommended by Rick Chertoff, the album's producer. Lauper had already recorded the majority of the album, including the songs \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", \"She Bop\" and \"All Through the Night\", but Chertoff insisted that she and Hyman needed to record just \"one more song\". Therefore, she and Hyman sat at a piano and started working on \"Time After Time\". The inspiration for the song came after both songwriters were going through similar situations in their respective relationships; he was coming out of a relationship, while she was having difficulties with her boyfriend, David Wolff. One of the first lines Rob wrote was \"suitcase of memories\", which according to Lauper, \"struck her\", claiming it was a \"wonderful line\", while other lines came from Lauper's life. The song's title was inspired after Lauper started writing for the song and needed a fake title as a placeholder for the time being. Thus, Lauper was looking in the \"TV Guide\" and saw a lot of movie titles, with the 1979 science fiction movie \"Time After Time\" being chosen. Although trying to remove the title later, Lauper claimed she couldn't take it out without the song falling apart.\n\n[3] Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song): \"Time After Time\" is the second single by American singer-songwriter Cyndi Lauper from her debut studio album, \"She's So Unusual\" (1983), with Rob Hyman (co-writer and founding member of the rock band The Hooters) contributing backing vocals. The track was produced by Rick Chertoff and released as a single on January 27, 1984. The song became Lauper's first number 1 hit in the U.S. The song was written in the album's final stages, after \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", \"She Bop\" and \"All Through the Night\" had been written. The writing began with the title, which Lauper had seen in \"TV Guide\" magazine, referring to the science fiction film \"Time After Time\" (1979).\n\n[4] Cyndi Lauper: Her iconic cover and re-arrangement of \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" established her as 'a feminist idol'. Sheila Moeschen argued that the song 'embodied a different kind of feminine aesthetic that ran counter to the raw sensuality and edginess of her contemporaries like Madonna or veteran rockers Joan Jett and Pat Benatar' that introduced 'a nation of women to a new kind of female role model, one that celebrated difference and encouraged playfulness in self-expression'. John Rockwell wrote that the song was \"a giddily upbeat attestation to female pleasure that simultaneously made a feminist statement, fulfilled male fantasies and—especially in its often-played video version—evoked the warmth of family and friends.\" The video for \"Girls\" won the first-ever Best Female Video prize at the 1984 VMAs. It featured a multicultural cast of women with teased, sideways hair and neon eye shadow, singing alongside Lauper. She was the first woman to have four Top 5 hits from a debut album, the first woman to win the composing category solo during the 2013 Tony Awards and one of only four women to have won competitive Grammy, Emmy and Tony awards.\n\n[5] Cyndi Lauper discography: Lauper was a founding member of Blue Angel, who released their debut album in 1980 on Polydor Records. The album was unsuccessful, causing the band to break up and Lauper to file for bankruptcy. In 1983, Lauper obtained a contract with Portrait Records, and her debut solo album, \"She's So Unusual\", was released. The album was a major success, achieving platinum and gold certification around the world and spawning the hits \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", \"Time After Time\" and \"She Bop\". In 1985, Lauper released \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\", a single from the soundtrack to \"The Goonies\", and her second album, \"True Colors\", was released in 1986. \"True Colors\" was another successful album, along with the single of the same name and \"Change of Heart\". A starring role in the film \"Vibes\" in 1988 led to the release of \"Hole in My Heart (All the Way to China)\", which was a hit in Australia and New Zealand. Lauper's third album, \"A Night to Remember\", was released in 1989. This album was less successful, despite the popularity of the first single, \"I Drove All Night\". The following single, \"My First Night Without You\" managed to chart in the top 60 in the United States.\n\n[6] Cyndi Lauper: \"A Night to Remember\" – Lauper's third album – was released in the spring of 1989. The album had one hit, the No. 6 single \"I Drove All Night\", originally recorded by Roy Orbison, three years before his death on December 6, 1988. Lauper received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 1990 Grammy Awards for \"I Drove All Night\", but overall album sales for \"A Night to Remember\" were down. The music video for the album's song \"My First Night Without You\" was one of the first to be closed-captioned for the hearing impaired in which Cyndi would later drop from the music industry due to feeling miserable and Depressed about her singing career and the company that own rights to her music.\n\n[7] Boy Blue (Cyndi Lauper song): It was released as the album's fourth single in 1987 (see 1987 in music). The single version is a remix (which cuts much of Lauper's more impressive vocal wailing, presumably in effort to make it more commercially accessible). Charting at #71 on the Hot 100, it was Lauper's first solo single that failed to make a real impact on the charts. Proceeds from the sale of the single were donated to AIDS organizations.\n\n[8] Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song): The song also entered the Rolling Stone & MTV's \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\" at number 66. The song also entered VH1's \"100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years and \"100 Greatest Songs of the 80s\" lists, at numbers 22 and 19 respectively. The song was also present on NME's 100 Best Songs of the 1980s, being ranked at number 79. The website declared that \"‘Time After Time’ was a change in tack for Lauper, whose musical persona had previously been unstoppably light and frothy. ‘Time After Time’ was demoed quickly in time for inclusion on her debut ‘She’s So Unusual’, and ended up being a key song for both Lauper’s career and the decade itself.\"\"Time After Time\" became Lauper's first number-one single on the Billboard charts, reaching the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in June 1984. It also reached the top of the Adult Contemporary and Canadian Singles Chart. In the United Kingdom, \"Time After Time\" first peaked at number 54 on March 24, 1984, while peaking later at number 3, on June 16, 1984. In New Zealand, the song reached number 3, in Austria it reached number 5, in Switzerland it reached number 7, in France it peaked at number 9 and in Sweden it reached a peak of number 10.\n\n[9] All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song): The song was originally written by Jules Shear, and included on his 1983 debut solo album, \"Watch Dog\". Shear later recalled in an interview, \"[it's] like a big bonus really. Cyndi Lauper does a song ('All Through the Night') that's on a solo record of mine. I just thought, 'No one's really going to hear this.' Then she does it, and it becomes a Top 5 song.\" \"I'm just glad people know the songs, really. I think they're really good. The only problem is with people who don't know I wrote them. I do them and they think, 'God, he's doing that Cyndi Lauper song,'\" Shear said.\n\n[10] I Drove All Night: \"I Drove All Night\" was recorded by Cyndi Lauper for her third solo album, \"A Night To Remember.\" Lauper said she wanted to do it because she liked the idea \"of a woman driving, of a woman in control.\" The song was a top 10 pop hit in the United States—and was her last U.S. top 40 single to date, peaking at number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and also a hit in other countries. It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. The music video for \"I Drove All Night\", directed by Scott Kalvert and Cyndi Lauper, features shots of an antique car, Lauper's characteristically manic dancing, and movie film projected onto Lauper's naked body.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

These stars are estimated, via Kepler's 3rd law, to have periods ranging from a number of years to thousands of years. A visual binary consists of two stars, usually of a different brightness. Because of this, the brighter star is called the primary and the fainter one is called the companion. If the primary is too bright, relative to the companion, this can cause a glare making it difficult to resolve the two components. However, it is possible to resolve the system if observations of the brighter star show it to wobble about a centre of mass. In general, a visual binary can be resolved into two stars with a telescope if their centres are separated by a value greater than or equal to one arcsecond, but with modern professional telescopes, interferometry, or space-based equipment, stars can be resolved at closer distances.\n\n[2] Binary star: John Michell was the first to suggest that double stars might be physically attached to each other when he argued in 1767 that the probability that a double star was due to a chance alignment was small. William Herschel began observing double stars in 1779 and soon thereafter published catalogs of about 700 double stars. By 1803, he had observed changes in the relative positions in a number of double stars over the course of 25 years, and concluded that they must be binary systems; the first orbit of a binary star, however, was not computed until 1827, when Félix Savary computed the orbit of Xi Ursae Majoris. Since this time, many more double stars have been catalogued and measured. The Washington Double Star Catalog, a database of visual double stars compiled by the United States Naval Observatory, contains over 100,000 pairs of double stars, including optical doubles as well as binary stars. Orbits are known for only a few thousand of these double stars, and most have not been ascertained to be either true binaries or optical double stars. This can be determined by observing the relative motion of the pairs. If the motion is part of an orbit, or if the stars have similar radial velocities and the difference in their proper motions is small compared to their common proper motion, the pair is probably physical. One of the tasks that remains for visual observers of double stars is to obtain sufficient observations to prove or disprove gravitational connection.\n\n[3] Binary star: The large distance between the components, as well as their difference in color, make Albireo one of the easiest observable visual binaries. The brightest member, which is the third-brightest star in the constellation Cygnus, is actually a close binary itself. Also in the Cygnus constellation is Cygnus X-1, an X-ray source considered to be a black hole. It is a high-mass X-ray binary, with the optical counterpart being a variable star. Sirius is another binary and the brightest star in the night time sky, with a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46. It is located in the constellation Canis Major. In 1844 Friedrich Bessel deduced that Sirius was a binary. In 1862 Alvan Graham Clark discovered the companion (Sirius B; the visible star is Sirius A). In 1915 astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory determined that Sirius B was a white dwarf, the first to be discovered. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined Sirius B to be in diameter, with a mass that is 98% of the Sun. An example of an eclipsing binary is Epsilon Aurigae in the constellation Auriga. The visible component belongs to the spectral class F0, the other (eclipsing) component is not visible. The last such eclipse occurred from 2009–2011, and it is hoped that the extensive observations that will likely be carried out may yield further insights into the nature of this system. Another eclipsing binary is Beta Lyrae, which is a semidetached binary star system in the constellation of Lyra.\n\n[4] Binary star: Binary stars are often detected optically, in which case they are called \"visual binaries\". Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known. They may also be detected by indirect techniques, such as spectroscopy (\"spectroscopic binaries\") or astrometry (\"astrometric binaries\"). If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along our line of sight, its components will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called \"eclipsing binaries\", or, as they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits, \"photometric binaries\".\n\n[5] Visual binary: In order to work out the masses of the components of a visual binary system, the distance to the system must first be determined, since from this astronomers can estimate the period of revolution and the separation between the two stars. The trigonometric parallax provides a direct method of calculating a star's mass. This will not apply to the visual binary systems, but it does form the basis of an indirect method called the dynamical parallax.\n\n[6] Stellar designations and names: Only a tiny minority of known stars have proper names; all others have only designations from various catalogues or lists, or no identifier at all. Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC enumerated about 850 naked-eye stars. Johann Bayer in 1603 listed about twice this number. Only in the 19th century did star catalogues list the naked-eye stars exhaustively. The Bright Star Catalogue, which is a star catalogue listing all stars of apparent magnitude 6.5 or brighter, or roughly every star visible to the naked eye from Earth, contains 9,096 stars. The most voluminous modern catalogues list on the order of a billion stars, out of an estimated total of 200 to 400 billion in the Milky Way.\n\n[7] PH1b: The giant planet is Neptune-sized, about 20-55 Earth-masses (). It has a radius 6.2 times that of Earth's. The star system is 5000 light years from Earth. The planet orbits a close binary, with a more distant binary orbiting at a distance, forming the quadruple star system. The star system has the Kepler Input Catalogue name KIC 4862625 as well as the designation Kepler-64. The close binary (Aa+Ab) that the planet circles has an orbital period of 20 days. They form an eclipsing binary pair. The two stars are (Aa) 1.5 solar mass () F-type main-sequence star and (Ab) red dwarf. The planet orbits this binary pair in a 138.3-day orbit. The binary pairs have a separation of 1000 AUs. A photometric-dynamical model was used to model the planetary system of the close binary pair. The distant binary (Ba+Bb) have a pair separation of 60 AU. The two stars are (Ba) G-type main-sequence star and (Bb) red dwarf. The quadruple star system has an estimated age of 2 gigayears. The system is located at right ascension declination , so also has a 2MASS catalogue entry of \"2MASS 19525162+3957183\"\n\n[8] Star system: A star system of two stars is known as a \"binary star\", \"binary star system\" or \"physical double star\". If there are no tidal effects, no perturbation from other forces, and no transfer of mass from one star to the other, such a system is stable, and both stars will trace out an elliptical orbit around the barycenter of the system indefinitely. \"(See Two-body problem)\". Examples of binary systems are Sirius, Procyon and Cygnus X-1, the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole. A multiple star system consists of three or more stars that appear from Earth to be close to one another in the sky. This may result from the stars actually being physically close and gravitationally bound to each other, in which case it is a \"physical\" multiple star, or this closeness may be merely apparent, in which case it is an \"optical\" multiple star (meaning that the stars may appear to be close to each other when viewed from planet Earth, as they both seem to occupy the same point in the sky, but in reality, one star may be much further away from Earth than the other, which is not readily apparent unless one can view them from a different angle). Physical multiple stars are also commonly called \"multiple stars\" or \"multiple star systems\".\n\n[9] International Ultraviolet Explorer: The IUE discovered many instances of white dwarf companions to main sequence stars. An example of this kind of system is Sirius, and at visible wavelengths the main sequence star is far brighter than the white dwarf. However, in the UV, the white dwarf can be as bright or brighter, as its higher temperature means it emits most of its radiation at these shorter wavelengths. In these systems, the white dwarf was originally the heavier star, but has shed most of its mass during the later stages of its evolution. Binary stars provide the only direct way to measure the mass of stars, from observations of their orbital motions. Thus, observations of binary stars where the two components are at such different stages of stellar evolution can be used to determine the relationship between the mass of stars and how they evolve.\n\n[10] Binary star: Systems with more than two stars are termed multiple stars. Algol is the most noted ternary (long thought to be a binary), located in the constellation Perseus. Two components of the system eclipse each other, the variation in the intensity of Algol first being recorded in 1670 by Geminiano Montanari. The name Algol means \"demon star\" (from \"al-ghūl\"), which was probably given due to its peculiar behavior. Another visible ternary is Alpha Centauri, in the southern constellation of Centaurus, which contains the fourth-brightest star in the night sky, with an apparent visual magnitude of −0.01. This system also underscores the fact that binaries need not be discounted in the search for habitable planets. Alpha Centauri A and B have an 11 AU distance at closest approach, and both should have stable habitable zones.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

It is known for its 4 km (2.5 miles) balneario beach, which is one of the most famous in the world.\n\n[2] Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro: Copacabana begins at Princesa Isabel Avenue and ends at Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Beyond Copacabana, there are two small beaches: one, inside Fort Copacabana and the other, right after it: Diabo (\"Devil\") Beach. Arpoador beach, where surfers go after its perfect waves, comes next, followed by the famous borough of Ipanema. The area was one of the four \"Olympic Zones\" during the 2016 Summer Olympics. According to Riotur, the Tourism Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro, there are 63 hotels and 10 hostels in Copacabana.\n\n[3] Copacabana Stadium: Copacabana Stadium, also known as the Beach Volleyball Arena (), was a temporary stadium located on Copacabana beach, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that hosted the beach volleyball competition of the 2016 Summer Olympics. It was erected in 2016 specifically for the Olympic Games and was planned to be dismantled after the Games.\n\n[4] Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro: Copacabana Beach plays host to millions of revellers during the annual New Year's Eve celebrations, and in most years, has been the official venue of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.  The Copacabana promenade is a pavement landscape in large scale (4 kilometres long). It was rebuilt in 1970 and has used a black and white Portuguese pavement design since its origin in the 1930s: a geometric wave. The Copacabana promenade was designed by Roberto Burle Marx.\n\n[5] Copacabana Palace: Belmond Copacabana Palace is a hotel in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, facing Copacabana beach. Designed by French architect Joseph Gire, it was built in a style that follows the line and model of the great beach hotels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and opened on August 13, 1923.\n\n[6] Urban beach: Natural urban beaches located at the sea have attracted tourists for a long time, such as the Copacabana of Rio, the central beach of San Sebastián or the \"City Beach\" in Stralsund.\n\n[7] Copacabana, New South Wales: Copacabana is a suburb located on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia, as part of the local government area. Copacabana (so named by real estate developers Willmore and Randell, in the mid twentieth century) is situated at the northern end of Macmasters Beach, the two beaches divided by Cochrone Lagoon. The northern headland of Copacabana beach is Tudibaring Point, purported to mean 'place where the waves pound like a beating heart' in the local indigenous language. The bay itself is Allagai, which means \"nest of snakes\" in the same language.\n\n[8] Copacabana, Rio de Janeiro: Copacabana beach, located at the Atlantic shore, stretches from Posto Dois (lifeguard watchtower Two) to Posto Seis (lifeguard watchtower Six). Leme is at Posto Um (lifeguard watchtower One). There are historic forts at both ends of Copacabana beach; Fort Copacabana, built in 1914, is at the south end by Posto Seis and Fort Duque de Caxias, built in 1779, at the north end. One curiosity is that the lifeguard watchtower of Posto Seis never existed. Hotels, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and residential buildings dot the promenade facing Avenida Atlântica.\n\n[9] Copacabana, Bolivia: Copacabana is the main Bolivian town on the shore of Lake Titicaca. The town has a large 16th-century shrine, the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana. Our Lady of Copacabana is the patron saint of Bolivia. The town is a destination for tourism in Bolivia. The town is also known for its famous Basilica, home of the Virgin of Copacabana, its trout, and its quaint atmosphere. Built between Mount Calvario and Mount Niño Calvario, the town has approximately 6,000 inhabitants. Copacabana's religious celebrations, cultural patrimony, and traditional festivals are well known throughout Bolivia. Boats leave for Isla del Sol, the sacred Inca island from Copacabana.\n\n[10] Rio de Janeiro: Until the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighbourhood now known as the historic city centre (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighbourhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogo's natural environment, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, \"the\" luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town (although this reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Murray leads 7–4 on hard courts and 3–0 on grass courts while Wawrinka leads 4–1 on clay courts. They have also met six times in Grand Slam tournaments with each player winning three matches. They have contested some close matches and one of their most notable matches was in the 2009 Wimbledon fourth round which Murray won in five sets and was the first men's match to be played under the Wimbledon roof, having the latest finish for a Wimbledon match at the time. Wawrinka also ended Murray's title defense at the 2013 US Open quarter-finals with a comfortable straight sets victory. Other close matches the two have contested include the 2010 US Open which Wawrinka won in four sets. Murray won the 2008 Canada Open and 2011 Shanghai Masters.\n\n[2] Andy Murray: Novak Djokovic and Murray have met 36 times with Djokovic leading 25–11. Djokovic leads 5–1 on clay, 20–8 on hard courts, and Murray leads 2–0 on grass. The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being only a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray won the first match they ever played as teenagers. The pair have met 19 times in finals, with Djokovic leading 11–8. Ten of the finals were at ATP Masters 1000 events, and they are tied at 5–5. They have met in seven Major finals: The 2011 Australian Open, the 2012 US Open, the 2013 Australian Open, the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, the 2015 Australian Open, the 2016 Australian Open, and the 2016 French Open. Djokovic has won in Australia four times and their single French open final, Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon. The former of Murray's victories was the longest ever final at the US Open, tying with the 1988 final played between Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander at 4 hours and 53 minutes, while the latter was notable for being the first home triumph in men's singles at Wimbledon since 1936.\n\n[3] 2013 Andy Murray tennis season: At Wimbledon, Murray made it through his first three matches without losing a set, his first round match, in which he defeated German Benjamin Becker, whom he had defeated at Queen's Club just weeks earlier, took Murray's Grand Slam match wins total to 107, surpassing Fred Perry's total, making Murray the British player with most all time match wins at Grand Slam tournaments. Murray then beat Lu Yen-hsun of Chinese Taipei in round two, and Spanish 32nd seed Tommy Robredo in the third, against whom Murray hadn't played since 2009. In the fourth round match Murray beat Russian Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets despite going 5-2 down in the second set (which, like the previous round, was also the first meeting between the two since 2009). In the quarterfinals, Murray met left-hander Fernando Verdasco of Spain, who had beaten Murray in their previous Grand Slam meeting. Verdasco won the first two sets, before Murray raised his level of play considerably, eventually coming through to win in five sets and reach his fifth consecutive Wimbledon semifinal, tying him with John McEnroe in fourth place for most consecutive semifinals at Wimbledon behind Roger Federer, Jimmy Connors and Björn Borg. Murray faced Jerzy Janowicz of Poland in the semifinals, against whom Murray lost in the 2012 Paris Masters. Despite dropping the opening set in a tiebreak, the Scot eventually prevailed in four to set up a fourth Grand Slam final against Novak Djokovic, the second meeting between the two at SW19, and the first at the Championships. Murray defeated Djokovic in straight sets (6-4, 7-5, 6-4) to become the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936, the first Scot of either sex to win a Wimbledon singles title since 189\n\n[4] List of career achievements by Andy Murray: At the 2012 US Open, Murray became the first British player since 1977, and the first British man since 1936, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament, when he defeated Novak Djokovic in the final in five sets. This title made him the only British male to become a Grand Slam singles champion during the Open Era. On 7 July 2013, Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, becoming the first British player to win a Wimbledon senior singles title since Virginia Wade in 1977, and the first British man to win the Men's Singles Championship since Fred Perry, 77 years previously. Murray is the only man in history to have won Olympic Gold and the US Open in the same calendar year, as well as the third man to hold the Gold Medal and two majors on different surfaces (after Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal). He is also the very first tennis player and only man in its history to have won two Olympics Gold Medal in the singles category and on two different surfaces (grass in 2012, and hard 2016), making a consecutive Olympics singles Gold Medal final in Rio 2016 and defending his title by defeating Juan Martín del Potro in the Gold Medal singles final. Subsequent to his success at the Olympics and Wimbledon in 2013, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\n\n[5] Stan Wawrinka: Wawrinka and Andy Murray have played 19 times with Wawrinka trailing . Murray leads 7–4 on hard courts and 3–0 on grass courts while Wawrinka leads 4–1 on clay courts. They have also met 6 times in Grand Slam tournaments and result is tied 3–3. They have contested some close matches and two of their most notable matches were in the 2009 Wimbledon fourth round which Murray won in five sets and was the first men's match to be played under the Wimbledon roof, having the latest finish for a Wimbledon match at the time., and the 2017 French Open semi-final, where Wawrinka prevailed in a five-set thriller that lasted over four hours. Wawrinka also ended Murray's title defense at the 2013 US Open quarterfinals with a comfortable straight sets victory. Other close matches the two have contested include the 2010 US Open which Wawrinka won in four sets and was Murray's last defeat before a grand Slam quarterfinal until the 2015 US Open, the 2008 Canada Open and 2011 Shanghai Masters, both of which Murray won in three sets.\n\n[6] 2008 Wimbledon Championships: Spanish player Rafael Nadal won the first Wimbledon title of his career; the first Grand Slam tournament he had won other than the French Open. Nadal defeated five-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final in what many regard as the greatest tennis match of all time. In the women's singles, Venus Williams claimed her fifth title, and first win over her sister Serena in a Wimbledon final (she had lost the previous two). The performances of Britons Andy Murray in the men's singles and Laura Robson in the girls' singles were able to arouse significant interest from the home crowd.\n\n[7] Harold Mahony: Mahony made his Wimbledon debut in 1890 exiting in the first round. He reached the semifinal in 1891 and 1892. Mahony spent some time in America in the mid-1890s, before returning to England and finally taking the Wimbledon crown in 1896. In the final he beat Wilfred Baddeley of Great Britain in five sets: 6–2, 6–8, 5–7, 8–6, 6–3. Under the challenger system Mahony was entitled to defend the Wimbledon title in 1897 but this time he was beaten in the Challenge Round in three straight sets by Reginald Doherty. He was the last Scottish-born player to win a grand slam until Andy Murray won the US Open in 2012 and win Wimbledon until Murray won it in 2013. He was recognised as the third and last Irishman to win the Wimbledon singles.\n\n[8] Andy Murray: Murray won for the first time on grass at Queen's and became the first British winner of the tournament since 1938. In the final Murray defeated American James Blake. At Wimbledon, against Stanislas Wawrinka, Murray's fourth round match was the first match to be played entirely under Wimbledon's retractable roof. This also enabled it to be the then latest finishing match ever at Wimbledon, a record he would go on to eclipse three years later in a second round match against Marcos Baghdatis. However Murray lost a tight semi-final to Andy Roddick.\n\n[9] Major Ritchie: He was a three-time medalist at the 1908 London Olympics. At the Games he won a Gold (Men's Singles), Silver (Men's Doubles) and Bronze (Men's Indoor Singles) medal. He remained the last British player to win an Olympic medal in singles until Andy Murray won Gold in the 2012 games, also in London. In 1908 and 1910 he and Anthony Wilding won the doubles in Wimbledon. In 1902 Ritchie reached the all comers final at Wimbledon, beating Sydney Smith before losing to Laurence Doherty. In 1903 and 1904 Ritchie lost in the all comers final to Frank Riseley. In 1909 he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round, beating Harry Parker, Stanley Doust, Charles P. Dixon and Herbert Roper Barrett before losing in five sets to Arthur Gore. In March 1907 Ritchie caused an upset by defeating Laurence Doherty in the Monte Carlo singles final. In June 1907 he won the Irish championships. Ritchie was a five times winner of the Championships of Germany, played in Hamburg, from 1903 to 1906 and in 1908 (in 1904 and 1906 he also won the doubles title). He was also a five-time winner of the singles title at the Austrian Championship (from 1900 to 1903 and 1905). In 1908 he was member of the British Davis Cup team. He won three consecutive titles at the Surrey Championships from 1908–1910.\n\n[10] 2013 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles: Andy Murray defeated Novak Djokovic in the final in straight sets, 6–4, 7–5, 6–4 to win the Gentlemen's Singles tennis title at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, ending a 76-year drought, as well as the first British winner in singles since Virginia Wade won the women's event in 1977. He was also the first Scot to win the Wimbledon title since Harold Mahony in 1896. Djokovic had advanced to the final after an epic and gruelling five-set semifinal against Juan Martín del Potro. At 4 hours and 43 minutes this match made history as the longest semifinal ever contested at Wimbledon, breaking the previous record set by Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl, both at one time coaches of Djokovic and Murray respectively, at the 1989 Championships.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

On December 5, 2007, LaPointe went to the National Museum of Natural History for the repatriation of both items. A ceremony with regard to Sitting Bull’s hair followed at LaPointe's South Dakota residence. A small portion of hair was also given to a DNA specialist in Europe to enable those who believe they might be related to Sitting Bull to have a DNA test done.  LaPointe, along with his sisters Marlene Little Spotted Horse Andersen, Ethel Little Spotted Horse Bates, and Lydia Little Spotted Horse Red Paint, have been petitioning the government for the reinterment of their ancestor’s remains from a grave in South Dakota to the site of Sitting Bull’s greatest vision: the Battle of Little Big Horn.\n\n[2] Sitting Bull: Sitting Bull was born on land later included in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or \"Slow,\" said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included his father and his uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Jumping Badger displayed bravery by riding forward and counting coup on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota. Upon returning to camp his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son. The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake, which in the Lakota language means \"Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down\", would later be abbreviated to \"Sitting Bull\". Thereafter, Sitting Bull's father was known as Jumping Bull. At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull's father presented his son with an eagle feather to wear in his hair, a warrior's horse, and a hardened buffalo hide shield to mark his son's passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.\n\n[3] Sitting Bull (film): Sitting Bull is a 1954 Eastmancolor Western film directed by Sidney Salkow and René Cardona that was filmed in Mexico in CinemaScope. In a greatly fictionalised form, it depicts the war between Sitting Bull and the American forces, leading up to the Battle of the Little Bighorn and Custer's Last Stand. It was the first independent production to be filmed in the CinemaScope process. Featuring sympathetic portrayals of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, \"The New York Times\" called it a \"crazy horse opera\".\n\n[4] Sitting Bull (film): As the execution is about to take place, Sitting Bull comes to the fort to speak with President Grant. Parrish had told him \"the Great Chief will understand,\" believing he would show mercy to him because his only intention was to prevent more killing. Sitting Bull's pleas with Grant to spare his life. Grant then commutes his sentence to being discharged from the service.It was first announced that Boris Karloff would play the title role, but J. Carrol Naish ended up repeating his role from \"Annie Get Your Gun\". Credited in the film as \"Famous T.V. Star\" and technical advisor, Iron Eyes Cody played the role of Crazy Horse. Though sympathetic to the Native Americans, Minnesota producer Wilfred R. Frank (1892-1960) irritated the Sioux by not filming his epic at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. One of the first Westerns made in CinemaScope, Frank filmed in Mexico (using Mexican extras) due to cheaper costs. However, according to Cody, Estudios Churubusco overcharged Frank's production by several hundred thousand dollars.\n\n[5] Flying Hawk: Sitting Bull was Flying Hawk's uncle, Flying Hawk's mother and Sitting Bull's wife being sisters. He knew him well and wished to talk about him. Flying Hawk observed that Sitting Bull was the key strategist before and again after the fight was over. The fighting was led by Crazy Horse, his young War Chief, and Sitting Bull was not in the Custer fight. \"He was a strong speaker just like any white senator. He was a good politician. White politicians are only ‘medicine men’ for their people are most time crazy.\"\n\n[6] Grant Short Bull: The Soreback Band, including Short Bull and He Dog, surrendered with Crazy Horse at the Red Cloud Agency on May 6, 1877. Short Bull served in Company A Indian scouts that fall, but then left with the other northern bands when they fled the agency. These families cross the border into Canada to join Sitting Bull where they remained for the next three years. Short Bull surrendered with other Oglala at Fort Keogh in 1880-81 and was transferred to the Standing Rock Agency in the summer of 1881. He and other members of the Soreback band were transferred to the Pine Ridge Reservation in May 1882 where they all settled on the forks of the White River.\n\n[7] Crazy Horse: Sources differ on the precise year of Crazy Horse's birth, but most agree he was born between 1840 and 1845. According to Šúŋka Bloká (He Dog), he and Crazy Horse \"were both born in the same year at the same season of the year,\" which census records and other interviews place in 1842. Ptehé Wóptuȟ’a (Encouraging Bear), an Oglala medicine man and spiritual adviser to Crazy Horse, reported that Crazy Horse was born \"in the year in which the band to which he belonged, the Oglala, stole One Hundred Horses, and in the fall of the year,\" a reference to the annual Lakota calendar or winter count. Among the Oglala winter counts, the stealing of 100 horses is noted by Cloud Shield, and possibly by American Horse and Red Horse owner, as equivalent to the year 1840–41. Oral history accounts from relatives on the Cheyenne River Reservation place his birth in the spring of 1840. On the evening of his son's death, the elder Crazy Horse told Lieutenant H.R. Lemly that the year of birth was 1840.\n\n[8] August Schellenberg: His initial work was in the Don Shebib-directed coming-of-age film, Rip-Off, in 1971. In 1981, he did voices for the animated film \"Heavy Metal\". During the late 1990s he had major roles in \"Black Robe\" (as Chomina), \"Free Willy\" and its sequels (as Randolph Johnson), \"Iron Will\" (Ned Dodd), \"True Heart\" (Khonanesta), and TV film \"Crazy Horse\" (Sitting Bull). He went on to star as Chief Powhatan in Terrence Malick's 2005 film \"The New World\". He also had roles in Disney's \"Eight Below\" and the doco within a film \"The Green Chain\" (2007). In 2011, he appeared in two episodes of the television series \"Stargate Universe\" as Yaozu. His favorite role was that of Sitting Bull in the film \"Crazy Horse\", a character he reprised in the film version of the Dee Brown bestseller \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\", for which he received an Emmy nomination. He also starred in Dreamkeeper (2003) as Pete Chasing Horse.\n\n[9] Amos Bad Heart Bull: At the end of the Great Sioux War of 1876-77, the Bad Heart Bull family surrendered at the Red Cloud Agency on April 18, 1877, several weeks before Crazy Horse. Following the killing of Crazy Horse in September 1877, the family moved with other northern Oglala to the nearby Spotted Tail Agency. The family fled north with other Oglala, eventually joining Sitting Bull in Canada. After a few years, the Bad Heart Bull family probably returned to the U.S. with other Oglala Lakota, who surrendered at Fort Keogh in 1880.\n\n[10] Frank Grouard: In about 1869, while working as a mail carrier, Grouard was captured near the mouth of the Milk River in Montana by Crow Indians who took all his possessions and abandoned him in a forest where he was found by Sioux Indians and later adopted as a brother by Chief Sitting Bull. He was probably accepted by them as an Indian because his Polynesian features resembled those of the Sioux. Grouard married a Sioux woman and learned to speak the Sioux language fluently, taking the Indian names 'Sitting-with-Upraised-Hands' and 'Standing Bear', (Yugata), as he had been captured wearing a bearskin coat. For seven to eight years he lived in the camps of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse until he managed to escape, becoming an emissary of the Indian Peace Commission at Red Cloud Agency in Nebraska. In 1876, Grouard became a Chief Indian Scout in the United States Army under General George Crook, fighting Sioux Indians. By February 1876, many Indians were leaving the reservations in search of food, refusing to return when ordered to by the United States government. General Crook began his winter march from Fort Fetterman on March 1, 1876 with many companies of troops and with Grouard as his Chief Indian scout and interpreter.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

In the human heart there is one atrium and one ventricle for each circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium is the upper chamber of the right side of the heart. The blood that is returned to the right atrium is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the pulmonary vein which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be pumped through the aorta to the different organs of the body.\n\n[2] Heart: The right heart collects deoxygenated blood from two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects in the right and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and to the middle of the opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.\n\n[3] Atrium (heart): Humans have a four-chambered heart consisting of the right atrium, left atrium, right ventricle, and left ventricle. The atria are the two upper chambers. The right atrium receives and holds deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, anterior cardiac veins and smallest cardiac veins and the coronary sinus, which it then sends down to the right ventricle (through the tricuspid valve) which in turn sends it to the pulmonary artery for pulmonary circulation. The left atrium receives the oxygenated blood from the left and right pulmonary veins, which it pumps to the left ventricle (through the mitral valve) for pumping out through the aorta for systemic circulation.\n\n[4] Blood: Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.\n\n[5] Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: In typical anatomy, the left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. In people with HLHS, the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped (beginning \"in utero\"), and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small to allow sufficient blood flow or are atretic (closed) altogether. As blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium, it cannot be pumped to the rest of the body by the left ventricle. The neonate is reliant on blood flowing through an atrial septal defect to mix oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and on a patent ductus arteriosus to allow blood to reach the aorta and the systemic circulation via the right ventricle. This is what defines HLHS as a \"single ventricle\" defect.\n\n[6] Bird: Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.\n\n[7] Venous blood: Venous blood is deoxygenated blood which travels from the peripheral vessels, through the venous system into the right atrium of the heart. Deoxygenated blood is then pumped by the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary artery which is divided in two branches, left and right to the left and right lungs respectively. Blood is oxygenated in the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.\n\n[8] Pulmonary artery banding: The heart is separated into 4 chambers. Deoxygenated blood enters into the right chambers of the heart and continues through the pulmonary arteries to be oxygenated in the lungs. Oxygenated blood returns into the left side of the heart and out to the rest of the body, known as the systemic circulation. In congenital heart defects such as ventricular septal defects (VSD) and Atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), there may be one or multiple holes in the walls separating adjacent chambers. This causes left-to-right shunting of blood as oxygenated blood can flow back to the right side of the heart, resulting in a mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Increased amounts of blood on the right side of the heart cause an excess of blood flow into the lungs (pulmonary circulation) and increased pulmonary resistance due to the buildup of pressure.\n\n[9] Frog: Frogs have three-chambered hearts, a feature they share with lizards. Oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through separate atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of the two types of blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.\n\n[10] Mammal: The mammalian heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows in the correct direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via one of the four pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

The Aztecs, then a nomadic tribe, were wandering throughout Mexico in search of a divine sign that would indicate the precise spot upon which they were to build their capital.  A closer look at the original Aztec codices, paintings, and the post-Cortesian codices shows that there was no snake in the original legends. While the Codex Fejérváry-Mayer depicts an eagle attacking a snake, other Aztec illustrations, like the Codex Mendoza, show only an eagle, while in the text of the Ramírez Codex, Huitzilopochtli asked the Aztecs to look for an eagle devouring a snake perched on a prickly pear cactus. In the text by Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin, the eagle is devouring something, but it is not mentioned what it is. Still other versions show the eagle clutching the Aztec symbol of war, the Atl-Tlachinolli glyph, or \"burning water\".\n\n[2] Coat of arms of Mexico: In 1960, the Mexican ornithologist Rafael Martín del Campo identified the eagle in the pre-Hispanic codex as the northern caracara or \"quebrantahuesos\", a species common in Mexico (although the name \"eagle\" is taxonomically incorrect, as the caracara is in the falcon family). The golden eagle is considered the official bird of Mexico. When Father Durán introduced the snake, it was originally an aquatic serpent. But in 1917, the serpent was changed to be a rattlesnake, because it was more common than the aquatic varieties in pre-Hispanic illustrations. As a result of this, the design and color of the snake on the modern coat of arms do not correspond with those of any species of snake, and were inspired by the representations of Quetzalcoatl, a rattlesnake with quetzal feathers. The seal of New Mexico includes the eagle, snake, and cactus of the Mexican seal, sheltered or dominated by an larger American eagle, representing New Mexico's history as part of Mexico and its later status as part of the United States. After the territory of New Mexico was admitted to the Union in 1912, a commission examining the new state's symbols recommended that both the \"American\" and \"Mexican\" eagles be American golden eagles, but instead it uses an American bald eagle for the United States and a harpy eagle for Mexico.\n\n[3] Coat of arms of Mexico: The coat of arms recalls the founding of Mexico City, then called Tenochtitlan. The legend of Tenochtitlan, as shown in the original Aztec codices, paintings, and post-Cortesian codices, does not include a snake. While the Codex Fejérváry-Mayer depicts an eagle attacking a snake, other Mexica illustrations, such as the Codex Mendoza, show only an eagle; in the text of the Ramírez Codex, however, Huitzilopochtli asked the Tenochtitlan people to look for an eagle devouring a snake, perched on a prickly pear cactus. In the text by Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuanitzin, the eagle is devouring something, but it is not mentioned what it is. Other versions (such as the backside of the Teocalli of the Sacred War) show the eagle clutching the Aztec symbol of war, the glyph, or \"burning water\".\n\n[4] National symbols of Mexico: The national symbols of Mexico are the flag, the coat of arms and the anthem. The flag is a vertical tricolor of green, white, and red. The coat of arms features a golden eagle eating a snake on top of a cactus.\n\n[5] United States one-dollar bill: The obverse of the seal on the right features a bald eagle, the national bird and symbol of the United States. Above the eagle is a radiant cluster of 13 stars arranged in a six-pointed star. The eagle's breast is covered by a heraldic shield with 13 stripes that resemble those on the American flag. As on the first US flag, the stars and stripes stand for the 13 original states of the union. The eagle holds a ribbon in its beak reading \"E PLURIBUS UNUM\", a Latin phrase meaning \"Out of many [states], one [nation]\", a \"de facto\" motto of the United States (and the only one until 1956). In its left talons the eagle holds 13 arrows, and in its right talons it holds an olive branch with 13 leaves and 13 olives, representing, respectively, the powers of war and peace. To the right of this seal, a string of 13 pearls extends toward the edge of the bill. A plate position (check) number is normally found to the left of the eagle.\n\n[6] Gadsden flag: In preparation for the 1976 bicentennial year, staff officers in the Secretary of the Navy's office sought a powerful image for the Navy's Bicentennial. One Navy officer saw the Snake on Stripes Flag in \"Webster's Dictionary\", so the staff officers ordered a large number to give away as Navy promotional items and then turned to the Naval Historical Center to \"get the history\". They were told that the flag had probably never flown during the Revolution, based on Admiral Preble's later discoveries, but a decision was made to use the Snake on Stripes Flag, or the \"Fake Snake Flag\", anyway. Beginning in 1975, commissioned Navy ships flew this Jack in place of the Naval Jack (officially known as the Union Jack, not to be confused with the United Kingdom's flag) at the bow. In 1977, the Secretary of the Navy directed that the ship in active status with the longest total period of active service shall display the First Navy Jack until decommissioned or transferred to inactive service, at which time the flag shall be passed to the next ship in line with appropriate honors. The display of this jack by the oldest ship in the fleet is intended as a form of recognition to promote pride of service, enhance morale, and contribute to the tradition of naval service. USS \"Enterprise\" (CVN 65) became the oldest active ship in the United States Navy upon the decommissioning of USS \"Kitty Hawk\" (CV 63) on May 12, 2009. \"Enterprise\" is only the third aircraft carrier ever to hold the honor of flying the First Navy Jack.\n\n[7] Gadsden flag: The First Navy Jack, which was not directly related to the Gadsden flag, has been in use by the United States Navy since its beginnings. Unlike the Liberty Tree Flag with the letter by Colonel Joseph Reed that describes it, there is no document that describes the Snake on Stripes flag, only an image by English artist Thomas Hart in the background of a portrait of Commodore Esek Hopkins. In that same painting is a round \"tree flag\". The triangular Liberty Tree flag is derived from the only surviving tree flag from the Revolution, found in an old trunk in 1993 on Long Island, the 5th Regt. Connecticut Militia. The Snake on Stripes flag was included in a book of flags by Admiral Preble, but later Preble determined the flag not valid, so he removed it from his text. However, the book publisher used the old color plates, so the image was continued in the new edition and subsequently picked up by other publications and \"Webster's Dictionary\".\n\n[8] Lincoln assassination flags: The second Treasury Guard flag was placed at the front of the presidential box at Ford's Theatre, the night of Lincoln's assassination. This flag, which is dark blue, features an eagle, 34 stars and a banner with the words \"U.S. Treasury Guards\" below the emblem. A shield with vertical red and white stripes and a blue chief covers the eagle's chest. This flag is silk and measures 71.5\" x 77.5\". It is displayed at Ford's Theatre National Historical Site in Washington, D.C. A tear in this flag has led many to believe that it is the flag Booth tripped over in the escape.\n\n[9] Bald eagle: The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.\n\n[10] Coat of arms of Egypt: The \"Eagle of Saladin\" holds a scroll on which the name of the state appears in Arabic script, \"Gumhūriyyat Miṣr al-ʿArabiyyah\" (\"Arab Republic of Egypt\"). The eagle carries on its breast a shield with the flag's colors — but with a vertical instead of a horizontal configuration. When appearing on the national flag, the eagle is rendered entirely in gold and white. During the union with Syria in the United Arab Republic (1958–1961), and in the ten years afterwards when Egypt retained the union's official name, the two green stars of the union's flag appeared in the white band of the eagle's shield. Between 1972–1984 the eagle was replaced by the golden Hawk of Quraish, as part of the symbolism of the Federation of Arab Republics.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}

Compulsory sterilization, which is a method that forces individuals to partake in sterilization operations, was the main method employed by the Peruvian government to decrease population. While the motives and practices for such sterilizations vary, Compulsory Sterilization in the case of Peru under President Alberto Fujimori was a program strictly intended to lower national population growth by decreasing the fertility rate among women. The program, titled \"Programa Nacional de Población\" (National Population Program), was directed at Peru's impoverished, indigenous, and marginalized communities and therefore implied the government's intention to diminish the rural population in order to enhance future economic growth.\n\n[2] Programa Nacional de Población: With the newly drafted version of the National Population Program (\"Programa Nacional de Población\") under Fujimori, goals were specified in the context of demographics. The Peruvian Ministry of Health's program manager stated that impoverished indigenous women are \"poor and producing more poor people. The President is aware that the government cannot fight poverty without reducing the poor people's fertility. Thus, demographic goals are a combination of the population's right to access family planning and the government's anti-poverty strategy.\" The program was targeted towards poor women who had \"little or no formal education\". Thus, the program intended to:The National Population program called on both public and private sectors to assist in its strategic implementation. Furthermore, seven strategies were laid out as guidelines to reach the intended demographic goals:Because these strategies required the cooperation of various institutions, the program failed to be carried out with ease yet again due to the lack of coherence within the involved political sectors and agencies. Many agencies \"lacked sufficient power to carry out [its] functions\" and others were either \"not interested\" or opposed to working in agreement \"due to inter-institutional rivalries\". Peru's internal conflict from decades past continued to work against the overall productivity of the institution and its ability to sufficiently serve constituents.\n\n[3] Programa Nacional de Población: Because the procedures of the National Population Program went against Peru's constitutional law and violated human rights law, foreign donors threatened to suspend support for any aspects of the program that were sterilization related. Many public organizations, such as \"Centro de la Mujer Peruana Flora Tristán\" and the \"Comité de América Latina y el Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer\" (CLADEM), began to voice their concerns for the program and attempt to obtain evidence against the Ministry of Health and the Peruvian government for their covert actions. In 1997, the newspaper \"La República\" reported on the human rights violations of the National Population Program and sparked a nationwide debate that brought the government's actions to the forefront of Peruvian media.\n\n[4] Programa Nacional de Población: Funding was also a crucial issue that proved to be an additional setback to the National Population Program. In Peruvian government, as with many Latin American countries, the Catholic Church held significant power over issues both public and private. Essentially, the moral support of the distinguished members of the Church would result in financial support. However the Catholic community looked down upon the National Population Program due to its promise to provide modern contraceptives. Knowing fully well that his program would not be a success without the Catholic Church's approval, President Fujimori \"toned down\" the program's focus on contraception.\n\n[5] Programa Nacional de Población: The program's implementation also brought up several issues in terms of the quality and care of the procedures. Most of the personnel hired to perform sterilizations were not properly trained and much of the equipment used was outdated and lacking in quality. The counseling services provided to patients were also backed by poorly trained staff and many women were not given \"quality information prior to procedures\". When sterilizations were given, they were done so in a hurriedly manner. \"Teams were dispatchd one day at a time to perform procedures\" and therefore attempted to cover large masses of women in rural areas in very minimal amounts of time. As a result, patients were denied sufficient and proper treatment and rarely received follow-up care.\n\n[6] Programa Nacional de Población: The social and political climate of Peru in the 1990s at the time of the aforementioned sterilization program was the result of decades of class struggle and institutionalized inequality. Peru is a country that has long been subordinate to oligarchy in its society and as a result the class divide between a handful of \"powerful individuals\" and the remaining \"poor and impotent majority\" is significant.\n\n[7] Programa Nacional de Población: After the goals were defined and the funding for the National Population Program was in place, the number of annual sterilizations in Peru rose drastically. Prior to the program, there were less than 15,000 sterilizations performed per year and women could only have the operation performed \"if they had a health risk, four or more children, or were above a certain age\". However, after 1995 when sterilizations began to be performed, there were no pre-existing conditions necessary for sterilizations other than that women had to be considered part of Peru's poor and disenfranchised community. In addition, the number of annual sterilization procedures rose after the program's implementation from 15,000 to 67,000 in 1996 and 115,000 in 1997.\n\n[8] Programa Nacional de Población: In 1998, the Peruvian government and the Ministry of Health agreed to reform the controversial aspects of the National Population Program. The elimination of numeric goals was arguably the most important change to the program as demographic goals and quotas were no longer needed. While sterilization was not eliminated entirely, the reforms for the implementation of the procedure included:\n\n[9] Programa Nacional de Población: This issue of class - in addition to Peru's political instability and dependency on capitalist order from international governments - left the country in a vulnerable political, social, and economic position. In positions such as these, the poor are left inevitably to suffer from the failed policies of the upper class. This vulnerable state proved to be detrimental to Peru's constitutional government and civil society when the military overthrew President Fernando Belaúnde Terry in 1968 and remained in occupation of the government for an entire decade. Within this decade-long military regime under appointed President Juan Velasco Alvarado, Peruvian government made significant leftist reforms and intended to give justice to the poor. However, these reforms were unsuccessful and the poor and indigenous suffered as the country plummeted further into debt. It was not until 1979, under General Francisco Morales Bermúdez that Peru adopted a new national constitution and focused on regaining economic strength within the country.\n\n[10] Programa Nacional de Población: The population policy law, which continues to be in effect, intends to promote \"a balanced relationship between population size, structure and distribution, and socio-economic development.\" The law also specifically catered to the enhancement and protection of the human rights of Peruvian citizens with its promise to ensure voluntary and informed consent in issues regarding contraception and health services. However, Peru's government was still in the midst of internal conflict. Due to a lack of political support, there was not enough funding for the programs needed to carry out the National Population Policy Law. As a result, implementation of the law remained stagnant until the presidency of Alberto Fujimori in 1990. In 1991, a new National Population Program was developed, known as \"Programa Nacional de Población\". Although Fujimori was an avid public supporter of family planning, the new National Population Program and its specific goals and strategies seemingly counteracted the law's initial purpose of preserving individual human rights.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present."}}
