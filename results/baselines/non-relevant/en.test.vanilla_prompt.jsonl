The Sinsinawa Mound raid occurred on 29 June, five days after the Battle of Apple River Fort. As the band fled the pursuing militia, they passed through what are now Beloit and Janesville, then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh, where they headed west toward the Four Lakes region, near modern-day Madison. On 21 July 1832, the militia caught up with Black Hawk's band as they attempted to cross the Wisconsin River, near the present-day Town of Roxbury, in Dane County, Wisconsin, resulting in the Battle of Wisconsin Heights.\n\n[2] Buck Danny: As between 1989 and 1994, by 1996 the world had changed again and so Buck Danny's next album L'escadrille fantôme / Ghost Squadron plays against the backdrop of the Bosnian War, in particular the siege of Sarajevo. The theme was nothing but controversial: Frustrated by being forbidden to respond to obvious crimes committed by Serbian forces, the U.S. sets up a secret squadron of unmarked F 16 jets to combat Serbian warlords... Only to find out that 'the other side' operates a similar squadron of Mig 29 jet fighters. In spite of this controversy, the album was well received and Bergèse followed up with a two-album adventure Zone interdite - Tonnerre sur la cordillère (Restricted zone - Thunder over the Cordilleras) in which Buck and his friends revisit the fictional country of Mantegua. Although the story was less controversial: the fight against cocaine traffickers, it still showed the U.S maintaining an uneasy alliance with a local dictator and dared to give a little background on WHY so many farmers in Mantegua chose to cultivate coca rather than foodcrops. In a plot twist Charlier would be proud of however the real culprit is an international ring of criminals run -again- by Lady X. Unlike Charlier, this time they are in cahoots with criminal elements on the Navy aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower who use their supply\n\n[3] Doomsday (Doctor Who): Other location shooting took place at the Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay. The penultimate scene of the episode, the Doctor's farewell to Rose, was filmed on 16 January 2006; it was the last day of filming for Clarke and Dingwall. As with all scenes set at Bad Wolf Bay, these were in fact filmed at Southerndown beach in the Vale of Glamorgan. Piper's last scene was Rose's reunion with the Doctor in \"The Satan Pit\" on 31 March, but the shoot was rather emotional, to the point there were several tears on set. The last scene of \"Doomsday\", Catherine Tate's appearance in the TARDIS as Donna Noble (credited as \"The Bride\"), was filmed on 31 March during the wrap party. To ensure the secrecy of Rose's departure and Tate's appearance, only Piper and Tennant were given scripts of the departure scene, and director Graeme Harper was not informed of the final scene until the last possible second.\n\n[4] Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf): The video for \"Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)\" was shot in one take by director Hayley Young in Seattle, WA. It was uploaded to the Red Bull Records' YouTube page on January 26, 2015. The video starts showing few actors and then the camera locks on frontman Aaron Bruno, it becomes focused on him throughout the video, capturing his movements, and correlation of facial expressions in regards to the lyrics. Bruno then walks into a sea of people, as the electro rock element implements several scenes, and he is seen dancing casually as he continues to walk and sing.\n\n[5] Dinosaurs on a Spaceship: \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\" and the following episode, \"A Town Called Mercy\", were the first episodes to be produced for the seventh series, both directed by Saul Metzstein. The two episodes are Metzstein's first \"Doctor Who\" credits. The episode contains one of the biggest sets ever built for the show. The scenes in the \"engine room\" were filmed at Southerndown beach, Vale of Glamorgan in late February 2012. The beach had previously been used as \"Bad Wolf Bay\" in \"Doomsday\" (2006) and \"Journey's End\" (2008), and as the planet Alfava Metraxis in \"The Time of Angels\"/\"Flesh and Stone\" (2010).\n\n[6] Doomsday (Doctor Who): In a poll by \"SFX\", 90,000 readers voted the farewell scene between the Doctor and Rose at Bad Wolf Bay as the greatest Sci-fi moment ever.\n\n[7] Southerndown: It has been used in the occasional TV production, including on \"Doctor Who\": as Bad Wolf Bay in \"Doomsday\", and \"Journey's End\" and as the surface of the alien planet in \"The Time of Angels\" and \"Flesh and Stone\" and as the engine room of the ark ship in \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\". It also appeared in \"Merlin\" in the first-season episode 'The Labyrinth of Gedref' and in \"Sherlock\" during the fourth-season episode 'The Final Problem'. It was also featured in the Bob Dylan film Hearts of Fire, with Dylan looking out over the second beach down onto Rupert Everett.\n\n[8] Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's: Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's is the first compilation album released by American country music singer Shooter Jennings. It was released March 24, 2009 via Universal South Records. The album includes tracks from his first three studio albums — 2005's \"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\", 2006's \"Electric Rodeo\" and 2007's \"The Wolf\". Also included is the live recording of \"Daddy's Farm\". \"Living Proof\" is a cover of Hank Williams, Jr.'s 1976 single, and is new to this album. The album also includes a cover of Lonesome On'ry and Mean, a song which was covered in 1973 by Waylon Jennings.\n\n[9] Big Bad Wolf Books: Big Bad Wolf Books (The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale or BBW Books) is a Malaysian book fair frequently held in Malaysia,Myanmar , Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The books were majorly taken from the stocks of BookXcess, a book store dealing in excess or remaindered books from international distributors. The Sale was the brainchild of BookXcess founders Andrew Yap and Jacqueline Ng. It was first held on 13–18 May 2009 for 5 days at Dataran Hamodal, Petaling Jaya.\n\n[10] Hell's Heroes (film): Bob wants to abandon the boy, but the other two are determined to honor the woman's request. They start walking the 40 miles to New Jerusalem. Weakened by his wound, Barbwire eventually can go no further. He makes the others continue on without him, then shoots himself. That night, they stop to rest. When Bob wakes up the next morning, he finds Bill gone. A note explains he left to conserve the little remaining water. Bob goes on, discarding his belongings along the way, including finally the loot. At one point, he leaves the baby, but then picks him up again. His strength gives out just as he reaches a poisoned water hole. Then, he comes up with a plan. He drinks his fill, knowing that he will have about an hour before it kills him. He stumbles into New Jerusalem's church, where the congregation is celebrating Christmas. Then, his task completed, he dies without uttering a word.The real Western town of Bodie, California stood in for the fictional town of New Jerusalem. The production utilized much of the town's main street and included both exterior and interior footage of the Bodie Bank, which burned in 1932, and Methodist Church. The bank robbery sequence features an elaborate horse-drawn hearse which is still on display in the town's museum.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [6].\n\nNo answers found in the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The current address of the theater is 46 North Orange Avenue, and it is located at the southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Washington Street. The building's current lack of impressive architecture is offset by its significant cultural history. The Beacham Theatre was considered an important contributing structure when the Downtown Orlando historic district was created in 1980 and the building was granted local landmark status in 1987.\n\n[2] Beacham Theatre: Late in 1988 the lease for the Beacham's theater was secured by the Bellettos under Entertainment Investments International. Several of Lisa's cousins relocated to Orlando to help out with the task of preparing the Beacham for its opening and Brad's mother Bev tended the bar through the entire duration of the lease. The Bellettos also hosted an annual full-service Christmas dinner for hundreds of the city's homeless population at the Beacham Theatre with food donated by Orlando's high-end restaurants and businesses.\n\n[3] Beacham Theatre: Manager Harry Vincent started several promotions at the Beacham Theatre in the summer months of the mid-1920s that included Bank Night, Amateur Night, and Country Store Night, which was supported by dozens of local merchants. An advertisement for the Beacham in 1925 says, \"Don't talk about the hot weather. Beat the heat in a Beacham seat. 'Kum Keep Kumfy Kool at the Beacham' is known to many and you won't enjoy yourself until you too get into the line that leads to comfort.\"\n\n[4] Beacham Theatre: The Aahz Reunion Tour launched in 1998 and as of 2016, reunions of Aahz \"Late Night\" occur nearly biannually and are frequently held in the Beacham Theatre. \"Late Night\" reunions, however, now end promptly before 2:30 a.m.\n\n[5] Beacham Theatre: The early mornings at the Beacham Theatre kick started Orlando's own Summer of Love between 1991 and 1992 that helped usher in the increased popularity of the subculture surrounding electronic dance music in Florida and subsequently in the United States. \"Late Night\" organized several music festivals that were held at the Orange County Convention Center such as the \"Infonet\" DJ spinoff on October 24, 1992, the \"Infonet 2\" dance party on December 31, 1992, and \"Infonet 3,\" \"The Underground Explosion,\" on July 3, 1993. Subsequent large-event promoters failed to emulate the spirit of those events. Although, \"raves\" per se were not held in the Theater, the Beacham served as the prototype for nearly all of the larger so-called rave-oriented nightclubs that followed it. In doing so, \"Late Night\" at the Beacham Theatre inspired the genesis of the internationally recognized \"Orlando Sound\" genre that is also known as Florida breaks.\n\n[6] Beacham Theatre: The Beacham Theatre was constructed in 1921 by Braxton Beacham Sr., who had previously owned three other Orlando theaters and had served as Mayor of Orlando during 1907. In 1917 Beacham paid approximately $17,500–$20,000 for the property one block southwest of his stately residence on Jefferson Street after Orlando's citizens voted to pave the road to the cemetery instead of purchasing the old jail. The property he purchased had formerly served as the jail for Orange County since about 1873. With a $200,000 investment, the former jail building was torn down in 1919 and Beacham developed a series of connected building units along the west side of Orange Avenue between Washington Street and Oak Street (now Wall Street). The new building was then known as \"Beacham's Block\" and is now known the Beacham Building. The location of Beacham's theater was precisely where several condemned prisoners were executed by hanging. According to local folklore, the Beacham Building is reportedly haunted.\n\n[7] Beacham Theatre: The final all-night Aahz-themed events (The Return of Aahz) were held at the Beacham between September 7, 1991, and July 4, 1992, and lasted until Dekko's opened. However, \"Aahz\" was the theme that really stuck with patrons and among participants is still used as a nickname for \"Late Night\" reunion tour events and even for the Beacham Theatre itself. \"Lift\" night soon commenced in the Beacham Building's north-most unit, then called Barbarella's. The Beacham Building's north-most corner unit was once called Beach Club where Kimball Collins was resident DJ in the mid-1980s. \"Late Night\" in the Beacham Theatre returned when Unity presented \"Welcome (Back) to Late Night\" on October 30, 1993. \"Late Night's\" Reunion at the Beacham was then initiated at Dekko's.\n\n[8] Beacham Theatre: The Live Entertainment era currently continues on stages at both The Beacham and partner The Social. Prominent national and international musical acts perform with fidelity to the countless shows by numerous acts that have previously held performances in the Beacham Theatre from the mid-1970s through the early-1990s.\n\n[9] Beacham Theatre: Interest in silent films began to diminish in 1929 and they were gradually phased out and moved into obsolescence. On Thursday evenings at the Beacham for the Bank Night promotion, $200 was raffled with prizes of $50. On Saturday, December 24, 1931, and on Wednesday, September 28, 1932, a brand new $325 Austin 7 Sport Roadster was given away. Vaudeville acts continued touring at the Beacham for several more years until approximately 1933. Homer Fuller served as manager of the Beacham during the end of the eras of silent films and vaudeville.\n\n[10] Beacham Theatre: Following an effort to \"bring back the aesthetics of the old Beacham Theatre,\" in 2000 owners restored the Beacham's ornate plaster ceiling moldings, facade, and marquee. In addition, the sloping theater floor was made level and the stage was elevated. The original Beacham Theatre sign is awaiting restoration and is being stored on the roof.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [6], and [10].\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Morgan – who was later sued for breach of contract and accusations of taking storm-related videotapes, computer programs and forecasting equipment without the station's permission – left KOCO to become chief meteorologist at KFOR-TV in August 1992, and was later briefly replaced by former Weather Channel severe weather expert Vince Miller.\n\n[2] Wireless microphone: The first recorded patent for a wireless microphone was filed by Raymond A. Litke, an American electrical engineer with Educational Media Resources and San Jose State College, who invented a wireless microphone in 1957 to meet the multimedia needs for television, radio, and classroom instruction. His U.S. patent number 3134074 was granted in May 1964. Two microphone types were made available for purchase in 1959: hand-held and lavalier. The main transmitter module was a cigar-sized device which weighed . Vega Electronics Corporation manufactured the design in 1959, producing it as a product called the Vega-Mike. The device was first used by the broadcast media at the 1960 Democratic and Republican National Conventions. It allowed television reporters to roam the floor of the convention to interview participants, including presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.\n\n[3] Thomas E. Kurtz: As part of the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, Kemeny and Kurtz created the BASIC programming language. The very first BASIC program ran on May 1, 1964 at 4 a.m., and neither Kemeny nor Kurtz thought of this as a start to something grand. They merely hoped it would help students learn something about the computers they were using. The pair made certain that their invention was dispersed to the public straight away and made no real money from it. Dartmouth College copyrighted BASIC; however it made BASIC available and free to anyone wanting to use it. The name for the language originated from Kurtz’s wish to have a simple acronym that meant something as well. Kurtz states that, “We wanted a word that was simple but not simple-minded, and BASIC was that one.” BASIC along with the books published on it earned a lot of positive feedback, for example: “This second edition of Basic Programming gives a thorough description of BASIC, which is useful not only for the beginner, but also for the more experienced programmer.”; “ My overall evaluation of BASIC programming is that it is ideal for the individual who wishes to program with a minimum of effort and of equal value for group or classroom instruction.”\n\n[4] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[5] Portable computer: An early portable computer was manufactured in 1979 by GM Research, a small company in Santa Monica, California. The machine which was designed and patented by James Murez. It was called the Micro Star and later changed the name to The Small One. Although Xerox claims to have designed the first such system, the machine by Murez predated anything on the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time hence the patent was issued. As early as 1979, the U.S. Government was contracting to purchase these machines. Other major customers included Sandia Labs, General Dynamics, BBN (featured on the cover of their annual report in 1980 as the C.A.T. system) and several dozen private individuals and companies around the world. In 1979, Adam Osborne viewed the machine along with several hundred other visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the IEEE Westec in Los Angeles. Later that year the machine was also shown at the first COMDEX show.\n\n[6] Arlene Harris (inventor): In 1986, Harris also founded the company Cellular Pay Phone, Inc. (CPPI), where she developed her first patented invention, the first unique application of cellular service – custom designed cellular phone and a program-controlled end-to-end management system (created with Mal Gurian at OKI Electronics and the Cellular Mobile Division at Motorola). This offering made CPPI the first niche cellular reseller to create a tightly integrated system to support cellular service with automated payments by credit card. This system was licensed to GTE Mobilnet for use in its ViaCall service, which provided pay cellphones in public vehicles, limousines, trains, barges, and oil rigs. In 1986, Harris launched Dyna LLC in Chicago, Illinois, and later relocated the organization to Del Mar, California, to incubate and spin out new ideas and to help young companies and entrepreneurs. Affiliations\n\n[7] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H. Cockrum, Foram’s founder, chairman and CEO. “We wanted the most efficient office building ever designed, with no wasted space or wasted energy. This is a building of the future more than a building of the present. A lot of love has gone into that building, and a lot of pride.\"\n\n[8] IHunch: The first laptop was produced in 1981 but it took more than a decade of development for the designs to approach current (2016) levels of portability and capacity, and hence uptake. Apple produced the first smartphone (the iPhone) in 2007 and the first tablet (the iPad) in 2010. In 2015 there were 4.43 billion mobile phone (cellphone) users in the world, of which 2.6 billion had smartphones. In the US, 45% owned a tablet computer in 2014 and 92% owned a mobile phone; for younger adults aged 18–29, only 2% didn’t own a mobile phone and 50% had tablets.\n\n[9] Telecommunications in Honduras: Telecommunication in Honduras started in 1876 when the first telegraph was introduced, continued development with the telephone in 1891, radio in 1928, television in 1959, the Internet in the early 1990s, and cellphones in 1996.The first radio station in Honduras was Tropical Radio, which started operations in 1928.The first TV station in Honduras was Canal 5, which started operations in 1959.\n\n[10] Documentary Organization of Canada: • 1983 – First meetings, first intervention letter.

Methyl cyanide (CHCN) is thought to be important for the origins of life because it contains carbon-nitrogen bonds, which make up amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Up until this discovery, it was unclear if these molecules could exist in abundance in young disks because of their turbulent and chaotic nature. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Öberg's group was able to survey the orbital debris of the newly formed star MWC 480, to discover enough methyl cyanide to fill all of Earth's oceans and the presence of other simpler molecules such as hydrogen cyanide. This discovery is significant because it shows that the backbone of life, complex carbon bonds, are not exclusive to our Solar System. In an interview, Öberg stated that comet records suggest the presence of complex organic molecules in other protoplanetary disks as well.\n\n[2] Single-molecule experiment: Single-molecule techniques impacted optics, electronics, biology, and chemistry. In the biological sciences, the study of proteins and other complex biological machinery was limited to ensemble experiments that nearly made impossible the direct observation of their kinetics. For example, it was only after single molecule fluorescence microscopy was used to study kinesin-myosin pairs in muscle tissue that direct observation of the walking mechanisms were understood. These experiments, however, have for the most part been limited to in vitro studies, as useful techniques for live cell imaging have yet to be fully realized. The promise of single molecule in vivo imaging, however, brings with it an enormous potential to directly observe bio-molecules in native processes. These techniques are often targeted for studies involving low-copy proteins, many of which are still being discovered. These techniques have also been extended to study areas of chemistry, including the mapping of heterogeneous surfaces.\n\n[3] Photonic molecule: The first photonic realization of the two-level system of a photonic molecule was by Spreew et al., who used optical fibers to realize a ring resonator, although they did not use the term \"photonic molecule\". The two modes forming the molecule could then be the polarization modes of the ring or the clockwise and counterclockwise modes of the ring. This was followed by the demonstration of a lithographically-fabricated photonic molecule, inspired by an analogy with a simple diatomic molecule. However, other nature-inspired PM structures (such as ‘photonic benzene’) have been proposed and shown to support confined optical modes closely analogous to the ground-state molecular orbitals of their chemical counterparts.\n\n[4] Charles H. Townes: When Townes failed to be promoted to President of MIT during 1967, he accepted an offer from Clark Kerr to join the University of California at Berkeley and begin an astrophysical program. Townes soon began searching for molecules in space. At the time most astronomers thought that molecules could not exist in space because ultraviolet rays would destroy them. Townes eventually discovered ammonia and water in dust clouds, which shielded them from damaging rays, by essentially doing microwave spectroscopy on the sky. This created the topic of molecular/millimeter astronomy, which continues to find many complex molecules, some the precursors to life.\n\n[5] Acetic acid: Interstellar acetic acid was discovered in 1996 by a team led by David Mehringer using the former Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association array at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory and the former Millimeter Array located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory. It was first detected in the Sagittarius B2 North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 Large Molecule Heimat source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely radio interferometers; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.\n\n[6] Rosalind Franklin: Rosalind Franklin's first important contributions to the model popularised by Crick and Watson was her lecture at the seminar in November 1951, where she presented to those present, among them Watson, the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, her position being that the phosphate units are located in the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule. However, Watson, at the time ignorant of the chemistry, failed to comprehend the crucial information, and this led to construction of a wrong model.\n\n[7] Molecule Man: Doom and the Molecule Man arrived twenty-five years into the past of another universe, where they witnessed the origin of said reality's Molecule Man. The journey affected Molecule Man's mind, restoring it from its chaotic state which enables Reece to inform Doom that his accident was caused by the Beyonders, who created the Molecule Man in the first place as a singularity across every reality, to have the function of a \"bomb\", which would destroy its universe if he died. To prove his point the Molecule Man killed his counterpart, which set off the early death of his counterpart's universe, and is the default origin of the Incursions. The Molecule Man convinced Doom that in order to thwart the plans of the Beyonders, he had to embark on a mission to kill every one of the Molecule Men.\n\n[8] Harry Kroto: In 1985, on the basis of the Sussex studies and the stellar discoveries, laboratory experiments (with co-workers James R. Heath, Sean C. O'Brien, Yuan Liu, Robert Curl and Richard Smalley at Rice University) which simulated the chemical reactions in the atmospheres of the red giant stars demonstrated that stable C molecules could form spontaneously from a condensing carbon vapour. The co-investigators directed lasers at graphite and examined the results. The C molecule is a molecule with the same symmetry pattern as a football, consisting of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons of carbon atoms. Kroto named the molecule buckminsterfullerene, after Buckminster Fuller who had conceived of the geodesic domes, as the dome concept had provided a clue to the likely structure of the new species.\n\n[9] Astrochemistry: While radio astronomy was developed in the 1930s, it was not until 1937 that any substantial evidence arose for the conclusive identification of an interstellar \"molecule\" - up until this point, the only chemical species known to exist in interstellar space were atomic. These findings were confirmed in 1940, when McKellar et al. identified and attributed spectroscopic lines in an as-of-then unidentified radio observation to CH and CN molecules in interstellar space. In the thirty years afterwards, a small selection of other molecules were discovered in interstellar space: the most important being OH, discovered in 1963 and significant as a source of interstellar oxygen, and HCO (Formaldehyde), discovered in 1969 and significant for being the first observed organic, polyatomic molecule in interstellar space\n\n[10] Azafullerene: The first fullerene molecule to be discovered, and the family's namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C), was prepared in 1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University. A fullerene is any molecule composed entirely of carbon, in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes. Spherical fullerenes are also called buckyballs, and they resemble the balls used in football (soccer). Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of stacked graphene sheets of linked hexagonal rings; but they may also contain pentagonal (or sometimes heptagonal) rings.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The vaccine is marketed as Fluad in the U.S. and was first available in the 2016–2017 flu season. The vaccine contains the MF59C.1 adjuvant which is an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. It is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States. It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant. Per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines, Fluad can be used as an alternative to other influenza vaccines approved for people 65 years and older.\n\n[2] Public Employees Federation: In October 2009, PEF also fought a campaign to prevent the state from ordering the mandatory vaccination of thousands of state health care workers against the H1N1 flu virus (popularly known as the \"swine flu\"). The state ordered the mandatory vaccinations on September 30, 2009. Brynien and other PEF leaders demanded that the state make the vaccinations voluntary, arguing that the mass vaccination plan did not provide for exemptions for worker safety, such as pregnant women or those with severe allergies; the vaccine had not yet been properly tested for safety; and the vaccine did not provide enough protection to outweigh the invasion of civil rights. PEF sued, and on October 15 a state court agreed and imposed a temporary injunction preventing implementation of the plan. The state withdrew its plan a week later.\n\n[3] Fluzone: A high-dose vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose) 4x the strength of standard flu vaccine was approved by the FDA in 2009. This vaccine is intended for people 65 and over, who typically have weakened immune response due to normal aging. The vaccine produces a greater immune response than standard vaccine. According to the CDC, \"a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine [in August, 2014] indicated that the high-dose vaccine was 24.2% more effective in preventing flu in adults 65 years of age and older relative to a standard-dose vaccine.\" CDC recommends the high-dose vaccine for people 65 and over but expresses no preference between it and standard vaccine. Further studies are underway.\n\n[4] 2009 flu pandemic in the United Kingdom: The usual seasonal flu vaccines give little or no immunity against the new strain of flu. There is an international program to produce a vaccine which will be effective against the new H1N1 strain. The chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said on 25 June that it seemed likely that the UK would receive the first batches of vaccines slightly earlier than expected, possibly from August rather than the autumn as first expected, although some industry sources do not expect supplies to be available so soon. The government has contracts for 132 million doses. There are risks involved in shifting resources to the new vaccine: it will not be possible to produce the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is possible that the virus will mutate to make a vaccine developed before the mutation ineffective.\n\n[5] 2009 flu pandemic vaccine: After a meeting with the WHO on 14 May 2009, pharmaceutical companies said they were ready to begin making a swine flu vaccine. According to news reports, the WHO's experts will present recommendations to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, who was expected to issue advice to vaccine manufacturers and the Sixty-second World Health Assembly. WHO's Keiji Fukuda told reporters \"These are enormously complicated questions, and they are not something that anyone can make in a single meeting.\" Most flu vaccine companies can not make both seasonal flu vaccine and pandemic flu vaccine at the same time. Production takes months and it is impossible to switch halfway through if health officials make a mistake. If the swine flu mutates, scientists aren't sure how effective a vaccine made now from the current strain will remain. Rather than wait on the WHO decision, however, some countries in Europe have decided to go ahead with early vaccine orders.\n\n[6] Influenza vaccine: The egg-based technology (still in use as of 2005) for producing influenza vaccine was created in the 1950s. In the U.S. swine flu scare of 1976, President Gerald Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. Meanwhile, maximum military containment efforts succeeded unexpectedly in confining the new strain to the single army base where it had originated. On that base, a number of soldiers fell severely ill, but only one died. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as 400 excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, illustrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result has been cited to stoke lingering doubts about vaccination. In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976.\n\n[7] 2009 flu pandemic vaccine: Another option proposed by the CDC was an \"earlier rollout of seasonal vaccine,\" according to the CDC's Daniel Jernigan. He said the CDC would work with vaccine manufacturers and experts to see if that would be possible and desirable. Flu vaccination usually starts in September in the United States and peaks in November. Some vaccine experts agree it would be better to launch a second round of vaccinations against the new H1N1 strain instead of trying to add it to the seasonal flu vaccine or replacing one of its three components with the new H1N1 virus.\n\n[8] 2009 flu pandemic vaccine: There was concern in mid-2009 that, should a second, deadlier wave of this new H1N1 strain appear during the northern autumn of 2009, producing pandemic vaccines ahead of time could turn out to be a serious waste of resources as the vaccine might not be effective against it, and there would also be a shortage of seasonal flu vaccine available if production facilities were switched to the new vaccine. Seasonal flu vaccine was being made as of May 2009, according to WebMD. The news site added that although vaccine makers would be ready to switch to making a swine flu vaccine, many questions remained unanswered, including: \"Should we really make a swine flu vaccine? Should we base a vaccine on the current virus, since flu viruses change rapidly? Vaccine against the current virus might be far less effective against a changed virus – should we wait to see if the virus changes? If vaccine production doesn't start soon, swine flu vaccine won't be ready when it's needed.\"\n\n[9] Presidency of Gerald Ford: Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. In the early 1970s, an influenza strain H1N1 shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans. On February 5, 1976, an army recruit at Fort Dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized; health officials announced that \"swine flu\" was the cause. Soon after, public health officials in the Ford administration urged that every person in the United States be vaccinated. Although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems, some 25% of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in December 1976. The vaccine was blamed for twenty-five deaths; more people died from the shots than from the swine flu.\n\n[10] 2009 flu pandemic vaccine: On 20 May 2009, AP reported: \"Manufacturers won't be able to start making the [swine flu] vaccine until mid-July at the earliest, weeks later than previous predictions, according to an expert panel convened by WHO. It will then take months to produce the vaccine in large quantities. The swine flu virus is not growing very fast in laboratories, making it difficult for scientists to get the key ingredient they need for a vaccine, the 'seed stock' from the virus [...] In any case, mass producing a pandemic vaccine would be a gamble, as it would take away manufacturing capacity for the seasonal flu vaccine for the flu that kills up to 500,000 people each year. Some experts have wondered whether the world really needs a vaccine for an illness that so far appears mild.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was the flu vaccine introduced?\n\nI will wait for your response before providing the next question.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, the flu vaccine was introduced in the 1940s.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "No, answer is not present.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context 1.\nYes, answer is present in context 3.\nYes, answer is present in context 5.\nI don't know in context 2.\nI don't know in", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.

Whether Monmouthshire was part of Wales, or an English county treated for most purposes as though it were Welsh, was also settled by the 1972 Act, which included it in Wales.\n\n[2] England–Wales border: The boundary passes between Flintshire, Wrexham County Borough, Powys, and Monmouthshire in Wales and Cheshire West and Chester, Shropshire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire in England.\n\n[3] England–Wales border: The modern boundary between Wales and England runs from the salt marshes of the Dee estuary adjoining the Wirral Peninsula, across reclaimed land to the River Dee at Saltney just west of Chester. It then loops south to include within England an area southwest of Chester, before rejoining the Dee, and then loops east of the river to include within Wales a large area known as Maelor, formerly an exclave of Flintshire, between Bangor-on-Dee (in Wales) and Whitchurch (in England). Returning to the River Dee as far as Chirk, the boundary then loops to the west, following Offa's Dyke itself for about , and including within England the town of Oswestry, before reaching the River Vyrnwy at Llanymynech. It follows the Vyrnwy to its confluence with the River Severn, and then continues southwards, rising over Long Mountain east of Welshpool. East of Montgomery, the boundary again follows the line of Offa's Dyke for about , before looping eastwards to include within Wales a large area near Churchstoke. It then runs westwards to the River Teme, and follows the river southeastwards through Knighton before turning south towards the River Lugg at Presteigne, which is within Wales.\n\n[4] England–Wales border: The first legislation applying solely to Wales since the 16th century was passed in 1881. Subsequently, the border between England and Wales has taken on increasing legal and political significance. In 1964 a separate department of state was established for Wales – the Welsh Office – which assumed an increasing range of administrative responsibilities from Whitehall. By 1992, the Welsh Office oversaw housing, local government, roads, historic buildings, health, education, economic development, agriculture, fisheries and urban regeneration, although the extent to which it was able to be autonomous from England in public policy is a matter of debate.\n\n[5] England–Wales border: The establishment of devolved government in Wales through the Welsh Assembly, set up in 1999, has led to a divergence between England and Wales on some Government policies. One such is the fact that prescription charges were abolished in Wales in 2007. In 2008, residents of the village of Audlem, Cheshire, from the border, \"voted\" to become part of Wales in what was originally a joke ballot. Some residents sought to make a case for securing Welsh benefits such as free hospital parking and prescriptions. The modern border lies between the town of Knighton and its railway station, and divides the village of Llanymynech where a pub straddles the line. Knighton is the only town that can claim to be on the border as well as on Offa's Dyke. The postal and ecclesiastical borders are in places slightly different – for example the Shropshire village of Chirbury has Montgomery, as its post town, and the Welsh town of Presteigne is in the English Diocese of Hereford.\n\n[6] England–Wales border: The boundary continues southwards across hills to the River Wye, and follows the river upstream for a short distance to Hay-on-Wye, on the Welsh side of the border. It continues southwards and rises through and across the Black Mountains, following the Hatterall Ridge past Llanthony on the Welsh side and Longtown on the English side, to reach the River Monnow near Pandy. It then generally follows the river, past Pontrilas (in England) and Skenfrith (in Wales), towards Monmouth, looping eastwards to include the town itself and a surrounding area within Wales. At Redbrook, the boundary again reaches the Wye, and follows the river southwards, past Tintern and Chepstow on the Welsh side, to its confluence with the Severn at the Severn Bridge. The boundary then continues down the Severn estuary towards the Bristol Channel, with the small island of Flat Holm being administered as part of Wales and the neighbouring island of Steep Holm as part of England.\n\n[7] England–Wales border: At this point, the boundary between England and Wales, which has existed ever since, was effectively fixed. In the border areas, five new counties were created – Denbighshire, Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire – and Flintshire gained some additional territory. However, several of the marcher lordships were incorporated in whole or in part into English counties. The lordships of Ludlow, Clun, Caus and part of Montgomery were incorporated into Shropshire; and Wigmore, Huntington, Clifford and most of Ewyas were included in Herefordshire. According to John Davies:\n\n[8] England–Wales border: Thus was created the border between Wales and England, a border which has survived until today. It did not follow the old line of Offa's Dyke nor the eastern boundary of the Welsh dioceses; it excluded districts such as Oswestry and Ewias, where the Welsh language would continue to be spoken for centuries, districts which it would not be wholly fanciful to consider as \"Cambria irredenta\". Yet, as the purpose of the statute was to incorporate Wales into England, the location of the Welsh border was irrelevant to the purposes of its framers.\n\n[9] Anglo-Scottish border: The Anglo-Scottish border between England and Scotland runs for 96 miles (154 km) between Marshall Meadows Bay on the east coast and the Solway Firth in the west. It is Scotland's only land border with another country, and one of England's two (the other being with Wales).\n\n[10] England–Wales border: The England–Wales border, sometimes referred to as the Wales–England border or the Anglo-Welsh border, is the border between England and Wales, two constituent countries of the United Kingdom. It runs for from the Dee estuary, in the north, to the Severn estuary in the south. It has followed broadly the same line since the 8th century, and in part that of Offa's Dyke; the modern boundary was fixed in 1536, when the former marcher lordships which occupied the border area were abolished and new county boundaries were created.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.

It was published by Knopf in September 2007. With an initial print run of 750,000 copies, it debuted at the top of the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list in its first week. It was announced that an unspecified portion of proceeds would go to causes mentioned in the book. Clinton ultimately donated $1 million of the proceeds to charity. At the time the book was released, his wife the then junior United States Senator from New York Hillary Rodham Clinton, was seeking the Democratic nomination for President.\n\n[2] A Journey: Several more of Blair's former colleagues and political opponents also commented on the book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"\"A Journey\" seems to be dominated by Blair's anxiety to be seen as a great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others.\" However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of writing about it and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in \"The Guardian\", Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he \"read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself.\" He concluded that the book was \"a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better.\" Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book \"will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core.\" Of Blair, he said, \"There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular\n\n[3] The Shape of Things to Come: Wells depicted the European social scientist Gustave De Windt sitting down at the British Museum Library and setting out the precise blueprint for a transformation of the world which he would not live to see. This, in Theodore Wein's opinion, may have inspired Hari Seldon, Isaac Asimov's well-known character. Wein noted: \"Wells' De Windt, conducting his library research in London, capital of the declining British Empire, realized that the world was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Wells's book details how De Windt's disciples, the Modern State Society, set about implementing De Windt's vision. Asimov's Seldon conducted his library research in the Imperial Library of Trantor, capital of the declining Galactic Empire. He realized that the Galaxy was about to fall apart, and set out a detailed blueprint of how to put it together again. The bulk of Asimov's Foundation Series details how Seldon's disciples, the First Foundation and the Second one, set about implementing Seldon's vision.\".\n\n[4] Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World: Peter Baker, writing a review for the \"Washington Post\", described it as Bill Clinton's version of his wife's 1996 book \"It Takes a Village\". The book details efforts funded by the Clinton Foundation or which Clinton otherwise admires, with a message encouraging readers to join in. The book mentions the charity work of well-known people like Oprah Winfrey, Andre Agassi, and Warren Buffett, why each chooses to do it, and also mentions lesser known instances of charity.\n\n[5] Martha Graham: According to Agnes de Mille: The greatest thing [Graham] ever said to me was in 1943 after the opening of \"Oklahoma!\", when I suddenly had unexpected, flamboyant success for a work I thought was only fairly good, after years of neglect for work I thought was fine. I was bewildered and worried that my entire scale of values was untrustworthy. I talked to Martha. I remember the conversation well. It was in a Schrafft's restaurant over a soda. I confessed that I had a burning desire to be excellent, but no faith that I could be. Martha said to me, very quietly: \"There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep yourself open and aware to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open ... No artist is pleased. [There is] no satisfaction whatever at any time. There is only a queer divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more\n\n[6] Piers Akerman: In a November 2006 article in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Akerman quoted senior IPCC scientist John T. Houghton saying \"Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen\", attributing the quotation to his 1994 book \"Global Warming, The Complete Briefing\". The quote became widely used among climate change sceptics to argue that climate change scientists showed a propensity to exaggerate their case. However, the quote does not appear in any edition of the book. Houghton denied saying any such thing and believes the opposite to be true, commenting \"I would never say we should hype up the risk of climate disasters in order to get noticed.\" In February 2010, Ackerman responded by citing a September 1995 article in which Houghton was correctly quoted as saying \"If we want a good environmental policy in the future, we'll have to have a disaster\", adding that this passage was not much different to the misquotation Houghton had distanced himself from. A subsequent report by Media Watch noted that Houghton's full remark did not carry the same meaning: \"If we want a good environmental policy in the future we'll have to have a disaster. It's like safety on public transport. The only way humans will act is if there's been an accident.\"\n\n[7] Duff Cooper: H. G. Wells, in \"The Shape of Things to Come\", published in 1934, predicted a Second World War in which Britain would not participate but would vainly try to effect a peaceful compromise. In this vision, Duff Cooper was mentioned as one of several prominent Britons delivering \"brilliant pacific speeches\" which \"echo throughout Europe\" but fail to end the war; the other would-be peacemakers, in Wells' vision, included Leslie Hore Belisha, Ellen Wilkinson and Randolph Churchill.Notes Bibliography\n\n[8] Transformative social change: A key premise defining transformative social change is that \"the ends of justice can never be served by the means of injustice, even when the injustice is as subtle as the mental framework instilled by the quest for liberation.(\"Change vs. Transformation\" by Angel Kyodo Williams) Williams further proposes that \"because suffering cannot be alleviated by instigating suffering\"; the conditions under which social justice activists and seekers operate within organizationally need to exemplify the conditions they wish to ultimately see cultivated within society at large. This ideal coincides with the quote often attributed to but not said by Gandhi, \"You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\"\n\n[9] Max Roser: He said that there are three messages of his work: 'The world is much better; The world is awful; The world can be much better' saying that 'it is because the world is terrible still that it is so important to write about how the world became a better place.' In his most-quoted text he writes \"For our history to be a source of encouragement we have to know our history. The story that we tell ourselves about our history and our time matters. Because our hopes and efforts for building a better future are inextricably linked to our perception of the past it is important to understand and communicate the global development up to now. [...] Freedom is impossible without faith in free people. And if we are not aware of our history and falsely believe the opposite of what is true we risk losing faith in each other.\"\n\n[10] The Stories We Tell Ourselves: Some lyrics were inspired by people met by Hawkins at a grief counselling session he attended with his father over the death of his mother. The track \"Just Say When\" and \"Go to War\" was written about his recent divorce from his ex-wife. Another large influence on the album's writing was Hawkin's frustrations with the social and political climate leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. With both, lyrics were inspired by Hawkin's process of sifting through the details to determine what was \"actual reality\" versus what was just \"thoughts about reality\" or rather \"the stories we tell ourselves\". The song \"Do You Really Want It?\" explores the idea of whether or not global change can occur without personal reflection, repeating the line \"Everybody wants to change the world, but one thing’s clear: No one ever wants to change themselves\". The song opts to close on a more hopeful tone, rather than accusatory, repeating the line \"We can change it all\". Other inspiration came from a wide variety of writers that the band read during the time, ranging from Carl Jung to C. S. Lewis. Spoken word parts by another influence, British philosopher Alan Watts, are inter-dispersed throughout the album. While much of the song's lyrics were centered around hardships and frustrations, the track \"Who We Are\" focuses on more positive relationships, primarily the strong friendships between band members, and a newly formed romantic relationship by Hawkins\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWho is attributed with the famous quote \"You must be the change you wish to see in the world\"?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Although the Cleveland Browns won the 1964 NFL Championship Game, the match occurred two seasons prior to the first Super Bowl and six before the AFL–NFL merger. More than fifty years after winning their last league title, the Browns remain one of only four teams yet to play in the NFL title game during the modern era. More recently, the Cleveland Indians lost the 1995, 1997, and 2016 World Series, and the Cleveland Cavaliers were swept in both the 2007 and 2018 NBA Finals. In 2004, ESPN.com ranked Cleveland \"the most tortured sports city in America\". In 2012, \"Cleveland Scene\" dubbed the city's sports struggles \"The Curse of Chief Wahoo\", a reference to continued use of the controversial logo.\n\n[2] Cleveland Browns relocation controversy: The reactivated Browns have had only two winning seasons since returning to the NFL in 1999: a 9–7 finish in 2002 which also saw the team clinch a wild card spot in the playoffs, and a 10–6 finish in 2007 while barely missing the playoffs. Meanwhile, the Ravens have been more successful, reaching the playoffs eight times since 2000 and winning Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII, often to the dismay of Browns fans. Longtime placekicker Matt Stover was the last remaining Ravens player that played for the Modell-owned Browns – he departed the Ravens following the 2008 season when the team chose not to re-sign him, finishing his career with the Indianapolis Colts. General manager and former Browns tight end Ozzie Newsome (who was in a front-office role under Modell in Cleveland) remains with the Ravens.\n\n[3] History of the Cleveland Browns: Cleveland's success continued in 1955 after Brown convinced Graham to come back, arguing that the team lacked a solid alternative. Cleveland finished the regular season 9–2–1 and went on to win its third NFL championship, beating the Los Angeles Rams 38–14. It was Graham's last game; the win capped a 10-year run in which he led his team to the league championship every year, winning four in the AAFC and three in the NFL. Rams fans gave Graham a standing ovation when Brown pulled him from the game in the final minutes.\n\n[4] 1999 Cleveland Browns season: Football finally returned to Cleveland on September 12 when the Browns opened the season against the Pittsburgh Steelers at home; Cleveland native Drew Carey was present and gave a rousing pre-game speech. However, the fans were sorely disappointed as the Browns were defeated by the Steelers 43–0. The team would go on to lose their first seven games, but finally in week 8 of their inaugural season the \"New Browns\" got their first ever win over the New Orleans Saints. From the Browns' 42-yard line Tim Couch squared up and threw a Hail Mary pass that was tipped in the endzone by Saints defenders but then caught by the Browns' Kevin Johnson. The dramatic game-winning touchdown play happened in the last two seconds of the game, causing the final score to be 21–16. Two weeks later, the Browns defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16–15, for their second and final win of the year.\n\n[5] 1958 Cleveland Browns season: After the Detroit Lions whipped the Browns 59–14 in the 1957 NFL Championship Game to atone for the 56–10 pounding they had absorbed from Cleveland in the title contest three years earlier, the 1958 New York Giants took their turn. The Giants shut out the Browns 10–0 in a special playoff game at Yankee Stadium to determine the Eastern Conference champion. The last time the two teams met in such a special playoff contest was 1950, when Cleveland edged New York 8–3 to win the title in the American Conference, the forerunner of the Eastern Conference, and advance to the league championship game.\n\n[6] 1981 Cleveland Browns season: In 1980, the \"Kardiac Kids\" reached their zenith with last-second win after last-second win–13 of the 16 games were decided in the final two minutes—they finished 11–5 and captured the AFC Central crown. Every time the Browns needed to make a play, they did so. Every time they needed something good to happen, it did.\n\n[7] 1969 Cleveland Browns season: The Browns made it to the 1969 NFL Championship Game, where they fell to the Minnesota Vikings. The 1969 season would be the last year that Cleveland would win a postseason game until 1986. In addition, that victory over Dallas would also be the last time the Browns won a postseason game on the road as of 2017.\n\n[8] 1947 Cleveland Browns season: After a number of coaching changes and roster moves in the offseason, including signing punter Horace Gillom and fullback Tony Adamle, the Browns began with a 30–14 win over the Buffalo Bills, the first of a string of five victories. The team lost its only game of the season to the Los Angeles Dons in October. Five more wins followed before a come-from-behind tie in November with the New York Yankees, the team Cleveland defeated in the 1946 AAFC championship. The Browns won their last two games, including a 42–0 shutout against the Baltimore Colts in the finale, to set up a championship game rematch with the Yankees in December. Cleveland beat the Yankees 14–3 in New York on an icy field to win its second championship in a row.\n\n[9] History of the Cleveland Browns: Beginning in the 2014 season, the Browns use a live bullmastiff named \"Swagger\" as their new mascot. On October 5, 2014, the Browns staged the largest rally in team history, when after trailing the Tennessee Titans 28-3 with 1:09 left in the second quarter, Cleveland scored 26 unanswered points to win the game 29-28. This was also the largest rally by a road team in NFL history. After a 7-4 start, the Browns would lose their final five games to finish the 2014 season at 7-9, last in the AFC North.\n\n[10] 1964 Cleveland Browns season: This was the last major sports championship won by a Cleveland-based team until 2016, when the Cleveland Cavaliers, a team that was formed in 1970, defeated the defending champion Golden State Warriors in a seven-game NBA Finals. Not only is it remembered in Cleveland but ESPN ranks the '64 title game as the second-greatest NFL postseason upset, behind only Joe Namath's guaranteed win over the Colts in Super Bowl III four seasons later.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the information provided in the contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

He appears in both masked and unmasked forms (the latter being named \"Inferno Scorpion\"). \"Mortal Kombat: Fire & Ice\", which would have starred Scorpion and Sub-Zero in cooperative gameplay, was canceled when Paradox Development, the developers of \"Shaolin Monks\", \"couldn't do it in time and under budget.\"\n\n[2] Scorpion (Mortal Kombat): With the exception of the novel, Scorpion has been portrayed in alternate \"Mortal Kombat\" media as an antagonist, and his spear was never used in any sort of graphic nature as in the games. In the \"Mortal Kombat\" series produced by Malibu Comics, he is simply a specter consumed by revenge against Sub-Zero, and his spear was changed to a weapon resembling a spiked morning star that was attached to a whip-long length of either chain or rope. An altered version of his confrontation with Sub-Zero from the Midway comic was expanded in the first issue of the 1994 \"Blood & Thunder\" miniseries, by way of a one-page flashback of their fateful battle that ends with Scorpion being killed off-panel. Scorpion, along with the other series characters from the first game, seeks to solve all the riddles inside Shang Tsung's mystical tome, the Tao the Zhan, in order to gain absolute power (which no one accomplishes). In the third issue, the combatants are all imprisoned inside Shang Tsung's dungeon before Scorpion appears and frees them from their bonds, and in the fourth issue, when the fighters are stranded in Outworld after Raiden frees them from the dungeon, Scorpion kills Hydro, a Lin Kuei companion of Sub-Zero created exclusively for the series. Sub-Zero then destroys Scorpion's mortal form in a quick battle, and \n\n[3] Scorpion (Mortal Kombat): Scorpion is often regarded as one of the most popular and iconic characters in the \"Mortal Kombat\" franchise, and in the fighting-game genre in general. \"SuperGamePower\" gave him and Ryu from \"Street Fighter\" a shared award for the best fighter of 1996. \"Game Informer\" rated Scorpion the third best fighting game character in 2009, while UGO Networks ranked Scorpion second only to the series' main protagonist Liu Kang in their 2012 list of the top characters in the franchise. Scorpion was rated the third best ninja character in video games by Cheat Code Central in 2011, and \"PLAY\" similarly ranked him fourth on their own list in 2013. Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar ranked him as the seventh best fighting game character in the genre's history, stating, \"Scorpion has some tough competition in the \"MK\" franchise, but none come close to the sheer coolness of his 'undead antagonist' factor. Despite the fact that he started out as a mere palette swap, Scorpion’s appeal made him a frontrunner in every major \"MK\" game to date.\" \"Complex\" featured Scorpion in a whole host of best-of lists: he was ranked the fifth most brutal fighter in the series and the 15th best video game mascot, in addition to the fourth \"most dominant\" fighting game character, the 23rd \"most badass\" video game character of all time, and one of video game characters who deserved their own spinoff title: \"[W]hether you want to\n\n[4] Mortal Kombat (1992 video game): When fighting on the Pit stage, the player could qualify to fight the secret character Reptile, who uses the moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero, by meeting a special set of conditions. Players could not choose to play as Goro, Shang Tsung, or Reptile in the original game, where also neither of them has a Fatality, but eventually could play as all three in sequels. The Masked Guard in the Courtyard stage was portrayed by \"Mortal Kombat\" developer John Vogel.\n\n[5] Scorpion (Mortal Kombat): Scorpion appeared in the first \"Mortal Kombat\" as one of two palette-swapped ninja characters along with Sub-Zero. His early origins were revealed by the series' original chief character designer John Tobias in September 2011 when he posted several pages of old pre-production character sketches and notes on Twitter. Scorpion and Sub-Zero were simply described as \"[a] palette swap for 2 ninjas—a hunter and the hunted,\" while Tobias also considered the concepts of either one of them fleeing their clan, or a \"revenge story\" involving the then-unnamed characters being part of rival clans. In regards to the game's strict memory limitations, co-creator and programmer Ed Boon recalled: \"A lot of attention went into the economics of it, and so we knew that if we could take a character and change their color and use basically the same memory to create two characters, we'd save a lot of money and we'd have two characters.\" Scorpion was given a yellow palette with the developers deciding that it would symbolize fire as the exact opposite to Sub-Zero's ice blue, which \"prompted the story behind them being these opposing ninja-clan-type characters.\" A third ninja swap, Reptile, was added in the third revision as a hidden character who was outfitted in green and used Scorpion's spear (along with Sub-Zero's freeze) as part of his \n\n[6] Scorpion (Mortal Kombat): Scorpion has been playable in nearly every \"Mortal Kombat\" fighting game, the one exception being the original version of \"Mortal Kombat 3\". He was among the characters representing the series in the crossover games while having guest roles in other games, besides appearing in a variety of official series merchandise and other alternate media. Scorpion is featured on the logo of NetherRealm Studios, the successor of Midway Games.\n\n[7] Scorpion (Mortal Kombat): Scorpion (born Hanzo Hasashi) is a playable character and occasional boss character in the \"Mortal Kombat\" fighting game franchise created by Midway Games. Making his debut as one of the original seven playable characters in \"Mortal Kombat\" in 1992, he is an undead ninja specter seeking revenge for his own death at the hands of Sub-Zero, making him an anti-hero which has been his main role throughout the course of the series up until \"Mortal Kombat X\" but still remains neutral.\n\n[8] Mortal Kombat 3: Some of the characters from previous \"Mortal Kombat\" games who returned in \"Mortal Kombat 3\" were portrayed by new actors since their original portrayers left Midway due to royalty disputes over the use of their likenesses in console versions. Ho Sung Pak (Liu Kang in the first two games, as well as Shang Tsung in the first \"Mortal Kombat\"), Phillip Ahn (Shang Tsung in \"Mortal Kombat II\"), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Katalin Zamiar (Kitana/Mileena/Jade) and Daniel Pesina (Johnny Cage and Scorpion/Sub-Zero/Reptile/Smoke/Noob Saibot) were not involved in the production of \"MK3\". Prior to the release of \"Mortal Kombat 3\", Daniel appeared in an advertisement for another fighting game, \"BloodStorm\", which resulted in a false rumor that it got him fired by Midway. All this led to the use of new actors for Liu Kang (Eddie Wong), Sonya Blade (Kerri Hoskins), Shang Tsung and Sub-Zero (both played by John Turk) in \"MK3\". Richard Divizio (Kano) also took over the role of Noob Saibot (as the character was a recolored Kano in this version). Carlos Pesina, who played Raiden in the first two games, did not appear in \"MK3\" as a penalty for his involvement in the rival game \"Tattoo Assassins\", but was still employed by Midway and his character would return in \"Mortal Kombat Trilogy\", a\n\n[9] Scorpion (Mortal Kombat): Scorpion, along with all of the game's palette-swapped human ninja characters, was not playable in \"Mortal Kombat 3\", but returned in the 1995 upgrade \"Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3\" when Shao Kahn tries to conquer the Netherrealm after his invasion of Earth, and enlists the ninja in his forces. Scorpion's allegiance to Kahn quickly dissolves when he discovers, in a continuance of his \"MKII\" storyline, that Sub-Zero was one of Earth's chosen warriors, with whom he sided in their final showdown with Kahn.\n\n[10] J.J. Perry: He began his acting career when he did stunt work for the character of Johnny Cage in the first \"Mortal Kombat\" film. He then played Scorpion, Cyrax, and Noob Saibot in \"\" (Chris Casamassa was supposed to reprise as Scorpion but was working on the film \"Batman And Robin\", though he would return in \"Conquest\"), and appeared in the \"MK: Conquest\" TV series, this time as Scorpion's main rival Sub-Zero, in addition to doing stuntwork for the main character of Kung Lao. In addition to the \"Mortal Kombat\" series, Perry has done stuntwork for various television shows and movies such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", \"The Scorpion King\", \"24\", and \"Beowulf\". He was a member of the cast of the 2004 movie \"Sunland Heat\", and part of the stunt team for the 2006 fighting movie \"Ultraviolet\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nWho plays the voice of Scorpion in Mortal Kombat?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context 7.\nYes, answer is present in context 9.", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Scotland itself was often called or shown on maps as the \"Kingdom of Scone\" (or \"Sconiana\"), '. A comparison would be that Ireland was often called the \"Kingdom of Tara\", Tara, like Scone, serving as a ceremonial inauguration site. Scone was therefore the closest thing the Kingdom of Scotland had in its earliest years to a \"capital\". In either 1163 or 1164 King Malcolm IV described Scone Abbey as \", \"in the principal seat of our kingdom\". By this point, however, the rule of the King of the Scots was not confined to the Kingdom of Scotland, which then only referred to Scotland north of the river Forth. The king also ruled in Lothian, Strathclyde and the Honour of Huntingdon, and spent much of his time in these localities too. Moreover, the king was itinerant and had little permanent bureaucracy, so that any idea that Scone was a \"capital\" in the way the word is used today can make very little sense in this period. But in the medieval sense Scone can in many ways be called the \"capital of Scotland\" and was often referred to as \"the Royal City of Scone\n\n[2] ᅮ: ᅮ is one of the Korean hangul. The Unicode for ᅮ is U+315C.\n\n[3] Society of Scotland in the High Middle Ages: A \"toísech\" (\"chieftain\") was like a mormaer, providing for his lord the same services that a mormaer provided for the king. A \"toísech\" was normally a hereditary tenant of either a King (on royal demesne), a mormaer (on comital demesne), an abbot or a bishop. The Latin word usually used is \"thanus\", which is why the office-bearers are often called \"thanes\" in English. Although \"toísech\", as the older word, was broader in meaning than \"thanus\", many scholars spend a great deal of time arguing over when the office of \"thanus\" was introduced, when it is perhaps more reasonable to regard this institution, like other institutions, as formalisations and incorporations of pre-existing social structures by the Scottish rulers. However, it was perhaps in the tenth century that this particular institution acquired its Latin name, borrowed from Anglo-Saxon England. The formalization of this institution was largely confined to eastern Scotland north of the forth. Seventy-one thanages are on record from the Middle Ages, sixty-nine of which are in the eastern part of Scotland-proper, and two in Lothian.\n\n[4] Curse of Scotland: Q. \"Why is the\" Nine of Diamonds \"called\" the curse of Scotland? A. Diamonds as the Ornamental Jewels of a Regnal Crown, imply no more in the above-nam'd Proverb than a mark of Royalty, for SCOTLAND'S \"Kings\" for many Ages, were observ'd, each \"Ninth\" to be a \"Tyrant\", who by Civil Wars, and all the fatal consequences of intestine discord, plunging the \"Divided Kingdom\" into strange Disorders, gave occasion, \"in the course of time\", to form the Proverb.\n\n[5] S͎: s͎ is a symbol used in the Extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet to represent a whistled s.

The letter is used in the Haida language and Aleut languages of Alaska.\n\n[8] Scotland, PA: Scotland, PA is a 2001 film directed and written by William Morrissette. It is a modernized version of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\". The film stars James LeGros, Maura Tierney, and Christopher Walken. Shakespeare's tragedy, originally set in Dunsinane Castle in 11th century Scotland, is reworked into a dark comedy set in 1975, centered on \"Duncan's Cafe\", a fast-food restaurant in the small town of Scotland, Pennsylvania. The choice of Pennsylvania is arbitrary, though it coincides with two real towns, one southwest of Harrisburg on the outskirts of Chambersburg called Scotland and one just south of Erie, called Edinboro after Scotland's Edinburgh. The film was shot in Nova Scotia.\n\n[9] Scotland Yard: The name derives from the location of the original Metropolitan Police headquarters at 4 Whitehall Place, which had a rear entrance on a street called Great Scotland Yard. The Scotland Yard entrance became the public entrance to the police station, and over time the street and the Metropolitan Police became synonymous. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1964 that just as Wall Street gave its name to New York's financial district, Scotland Yard became the name for police activity in London. The force moved from Great Scotland Yard in 1890, to a newly completed building on the Victoria Embankment, and the name \"New Scotland Yard\" was adopted for the new headquarters. An adjacent building was completed in 1906. A third building was added in 1940. In 1967, the MPS moved its headquarters from the three-building complex to a tall, newly constructed building on Broadway in Victoria. In summer 2013, it was announced that the force would move to the Curtis Green Building – which is the third building of New Scotland Yard's previous site (1890–1967) – and that the headquarters would be renamed Scotland Yard. In November 2016, MPS moved to its new headquarters, which continues to bear the name of \"New Scotland Yard.\" Scotland Yard building is now owned by Indian billionaire Yusuff Ali M.A., chairman of Lulu Group International.\n\n[10] Saccharopine dehydrogenase (NAD+, L-lysine-forming): This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor.

However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought in the 2008 South Ossetia war and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia. The President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan has stated that Armenia will not formally recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states any time soon but reiterated his support for their residents’ right to self-determination, while adding that Armenia cannot recognise another entity in the same situation as long as it has not recognised the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Georgia supports resolution of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict within Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. Georgian State Minister for Diaspora Affairs Mirza (Papuna) Davitaia has stated that Georgia has unilaterally supported the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and they back the liberation of the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili stated that \"whoever opposes Azerbaijan\" is Georgia's \"enemy.\"\n\n[3] First Republic of Armenia: Relations between Armenia and Georgia, however, remained tense. In the spring of 1919, American relief agency officials began to complain that Georgian officials, who demanded a share of the provisions, were holding up railway traffic carrying vital supplies of flour and other foodstuffs to Armenia. Moved by their complaints and the debilitating food crisis in Armenia, Georges Clemenceau, as president of the Versailles Conference, issued a protest letter on July 18, calling on Georgia to cease further interference. Georgia issued its own protest to this communiqué, but by 25 July American officials were already reporting that rail traffic had begun to pick up. In autumn 1919, the two countries began negotiations for a new transit treaty.\n\n[4] Economy of Armenia: The only operational rail link into Armenia is from Georgia. During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through Abkhazia along the Black Sea. However, the rail link between Abkhazia and other Georgian regions has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.\n\n[5] Armenia–Serbia relations: Armenia has a dispute with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, in which Serbia supports finding a peaceful political solution through supporting the OSCE Minsk Group and its work. Serbia has a dispute with Kosovo over its recognition as a sovereign state, where Armenia's asserted position has been not to recognize Kosovo's independence. Both countries are members of the United Nations, Council of Europe, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, NATO's Partnership for Peace, the International Monetary Fund, and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\n\n[6] Kars–Gyumri–Tbilisi railway: The Gyumri-Tbilisi section is part of the Yerevan-Tbilisi mainline, and is Armenia's only functioning rail connection to the outside world, as Armenia's borders with Turkey and Azerbaijan are closed, and the direct Armenia-Iran rail link is still on the drawing board. During the Soviet era, this line was used by direct trains from Yerevan to Moscow and elsewhere in the USSR; but now trains from Armenia can only reach Georgia, because Georgia's rail connection with Russia has been severed due to the Abkhazian war, and Georgia's rail link to Azerbaijan is of little use to Armenians.\n\n[7] Peace of Amasya: The treaty defined the border between Iran and the Ottoman Empire and was followed by twenty years of peace. By this treaty, Armenia and Georgia were divided equally between the two, with Western Armenia, western Kurdistan, and western Georgia (incl. western Samtskhe) falling in Turkish hands while Eastern Armenia, eastern Kurdistan, and eastern Georgia (incl. eastern Samtskhe) stayed in Iranian hands. The Ottoman Empire obtained most of Iraq, including Baghdad, which gave them access to the Persian Gulf, while the Persians retained their former capital Tabriz and all their other northwestern territories in the Caucasus and as they were prior to the wars, such as Dagestan and all of what is now Azerbaijan. The frontier thus established ran across the mountains dividing eastern and western Georgia (under native vassal princes), through Armenia, and via the western slopes of the Zagros down to the Persian Gulf.\n\n[8] Javakheti: An expected improvement is the planned construction of the highway (financed by the US Millennium Challenge Account) to more effectively link the region with the rest of Georgia. Also, a railroad is planned to run from Kars, Turkey to Baku, Azerbaijan via the area (see: Kars Baku Tbilisi railway line), but the Armenian population of Javakheti are opposed to this rail link because it excludes and isolates Armenia. There is already another railroad linking Armenia, Georgia and Turkey, which is the Kars-Gyumri-Akhalkalaki railroad line. The existing line is in working condition and could be operational within weeks, but due to the Turkish blockade of Armenia since 1993, the railroad is not operational.\n\n[9] Georgian–Armenian War: The terms of the Armistice of Mudros between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies required the Ottomans pull their troops out of the Transcaucasus. The departure of the Ottomans created a power vacuum in the border area, in particular that between Armenia and Georgia. Armenia and Georgia began bilateral talks in November 1918, with Georgia sending a special envoy to Yerevan. Simultaneously, Georgia invited the recently independent governments of the Caucasus to Tbilisi for a conference with the principal aim of addressing boundary delimitation and issues of common concern. The general idea of a conference was well received by the Armenian government, however, the Armenia government took exception to the scope and quick timelines of the conference. In particular, Armenia was not interested in discussing border issues at a conference. Armenia indicated it would participate, recognizing the rapidly changing political environment following World War I, but reemphasized that they would not discuss the issues of delimitation. In general, however, Georgia was of the position that the border with Armenia should be inline with the border of the former Russian imperial Tiflis Province; whereas, Armenia was of the position that the border should correspond to ethnic composition or more historical boundaries.\n\n[10] Foreign policy of Vladimir Putin: Besides Georgia, the other two Caucasus states, Armenia and Azerbaijan, have also been a part of the rivalry between Russia and the West. The two countries are long-time rivals, and have a long-running dispute regarding control of Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia has close ties with Russia, while Azerbaijan has close ties to the United States and Turkey, both of which are members of NATO. However, NATO also ties to Armenia, and both Armenia and Azerbaijan have been speculated as potential future members of NATO. Armenia negotiated an Association Agreement with the European Union but, similar to Ukraine, Armenia chose to reject the deal in 2013. The next year, Armenia voted to join the Eurasian Economic Union, the Russian-backed free trade zone that seeks to rival the European Union. However, Armenian leaders have also worked towards a free trade agreement with the EU.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWhat linked Armenia, Georgia, Latvia and Moldavia?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

That year, PRISM began to be transmitted over-the-air on WWSG-TV (channel 57; now CW owned-and-operated station WPSG); the station scrambled its signal during hours when it transmitted the network's programming, requiring the use of decoding equipment in order to view PRISM content over WWSG. This only lasted for two years, ending when WWSG was sold to the Grant Broadcasting System in 1985 and was converted into a general entertainment independent station as WGBS-TV.\n\n[2] AMC Networks: AMC Networks responded to Dish Network's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by the company's former Voom HD Networks subsidiary (under the company's previous Rainbow Media Holdings brand) (which is pending trial in the New York State Supreme Court), in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish Network for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup and the five remaining channels the following day. Dish Network stated that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.\n\n[3] AMC (TV channel): Although movies remain an integral part of AMC's schedule, the network has garnered attention in recent years for its original series. The channel's first original series was the game show \"The Movie Masters\", which ran from 1989 to 1990 and was otherwise notable for being Gene Rayburn's last hosting role; outside \"Remember WENN\" and \"Filmfakers\", most of AMC's original programming prior to September 2007 consisted of film history-related documentary and review programs. The establishment of \"Mad Men\" in 2007, followed by that of \"Breaking Bad\" in 2008, has given AMC a reputation on par with premium cable networks HBO and Showtime, both of which rejected \"Mad Men\" before it came to AMC. The channel also airs some acquired programs such as \"\" and \"The Rifleman\" and shorts from The Three Stooges. Series programming, however, continues to occupy a limited portion of AMC's schedule.\n\n[4] American Motors Corporation: From 1980, AMC partnered with France's Renault to help finance their manufacturing operations, obtain much-needed capital, and source subcompact vehicles. By 1983 Renault had a controlling interest in AMC. After the 1983 model year, the AMC brand focused entirely on AWD autos; the company stopped producing two wheel drive cars. AMC facilities were used to produce the Renault-branded Alliance and Encore compact and subcompact cars. In 1985 Chrysler entered an agreement with AMC to produce Dodge Diplomats and Plymouth Furys as well as Dodge Omnis and Plymouth Horizons in AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin plant. At the time, AMC had excess manufacturing capacity, thus contract manufacturing for Chrysler made sense. In 1987, after further new vehicle development that included the Medallion (a re-badged Renault 21) and Giorgietto Giugiaro's Italdesign new full-size front-drive sedan that became the Eagle Premier, Renault sold its 47% ownership stake in AMC to Chrysler. Chrysler made a public offer to purchase all the remaining outstanding shares of AMC stock on the NYSE. Renault left the US market completely as a brand in 1987. The Renault Medallion was sold through the newly formed Jeep Eagle Division of Chrysler as an Eagle, not a Renault. AMC's badge would be used on the Eagle Sports Wagon through the 1988 model year, then be eliminated entirely. The Jeep/Eagle division of Chrysler Corporation was formed from the AMC Jeep Renault dealer network. The Jeep and\n\n[5] Dish Network: AMC Networks responded to Dish's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks, in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after). However, Dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.\n\n[6] AMC Theatres: By the 1980s, the company was experiencing strong growth. AMC had built and was operating a number of 10-screen multiplex cinemas in the United Kingdom, including sites at locations such as Dudley and Tamworth. These were subsequently bought and taken over by UCI. In 1995, AMC pioneered the first North American megaplex, a theater that could accommodate thousands, when it opened the AMC Grand 24 in Dallas, Texas; the first megaplex in the world had been built by European chain Kinepolis in 1988. AMC continued to open other megaplex theaters, such as the AMC Hampton Towne Center 24 in Hampton, Virginia, and the chain's busiest theater in the US, the AMC Empire 25 in New York City near Times Square. The largest theaters in the AMC chain have 30 screens, including the AMC Gulf Pointe 30 in Houston, Texas, the AMC DINE-IN Grapevine Mills 30 in Grapevine, Texas, the AMC Ontario Mills 30 in Ontario, California, the AMC Orange 30 in Orange, California, the AMC Cantera 30 in Warrenville, IL (now 17 screens and run by Regal Entertainment Group), and the AMC Forum 30 in Sterling Heights, Michigan.\n\n[7] 403rd Army Field Support Brigade: In 1988, AMC-FE was organized under the Logistics Assistance Program Activity (LAPA) and subsequently assigned to the Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA) in 1993. After Operation Desert Storm, AMC redesigned LAPA and created Logistics Support Elements (LSE). In October 1994, AMC LSE-FE was established at Camp Market, Korea with the responsibilities of developing AMC Contigency Plans (CONPLANs), Mobilization Plans (MOBPLANs), and Operations Plans (OPLANs) in support of Army Service Component Commanders (ASCC) for contingency operations within PACOM; however, during this time, the management of the War Reserve Stocks (WRS), Depot Support Activity Far East (DSAFE) and other Logistics assets within PACOM were splintered under direct management of various AMC staff sections and organizations.\n\n[8] Criticism of Dish Network: AMC Networks responded to Dish's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks (which is pending trial in the New York State Supreme Court), in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005, until May 12, 2008, when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after). However, Dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.\n\n[9] AMC Networks: On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, WEtv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WEtv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of \"Mad Men\" urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider, with Dish Network stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings.\n\n[10] AMC (TV channel): In June 1995, AMC filed a $550 million breach of contract lawsuit against Turner Entertainment, which alleged that the company violated AMC's exclusive cable television rights to the pre-1950 Warner Bros. Pictures film library to broadcast approximately 30 times between July 1994 and April 1995, charging that Turner's objective in violating the contract was \"to gain unfair advantage for the Turner Classic Movies cable network (which debuted in April 1994) at the expense of AMC.\"; Turner owns rights to the RKO Radio Pictures film library and licensed RKO's films to AMC in an output deal that was slated to last through 2004. Under the terms of the deal, AMC would obtain the RKO titles in exclusive windows.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

In 2001, the official name became World Water Week in Stockholm. SIWI identifies a conference theme to place a specific focus on one aspect of the world's escalating water crisis. Initially, one theme was promoted for 4-5 years. Since 2008, a different theme has been selected for each year.\n\n[2] World Water Day: In 2017, the theme was \"Why Waste Water?\" which is about reducing and reusing wastewater. The theme is a play on words as it relates to both: the aspect of wasting water and issues around wastewater, namely treatment and reuse. Wastewater is a valuable resource to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6. One aspect of Target 6.3 is to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater and also to increase the recycling and safe reuse of water across the globe. After appropriate treatment, wastewater can be used for a variety of purposes. Industry, for example, can reuse water in cooling towers and agriculture can reuse water for irrigation.\n\n[3] UN-Water: Every year, UN-Water coordinates the United Nations international observances on freshwater and sanitation: World Water Day and World Toilet Day. Depending on the official UN theme of the campaign, they are led by one or more UN-Water Members and Partners with a related mandate. On World Water Day, UN-Water releases the World Water Development Report focusing on the same topic as the campaign.\n\n[4] World Water Day: Previous themes for the years 2015 to 2017 were \"Water and Sustainable Development\", \"Water and Jobs'\" and \"Why waste water?\" The latter theme included attention to both wastewater and the value of reclaiming water. The focus on universal access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is in line with the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6.\n\n[5] World Water Day: With the theme ‘Water and Sustainable Development’, the year 2015 provided an important opportunity to consolidate and build upon the previous World Water Days to highlight water's role in the sustainable development agenda. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were to have been achieved by 2015, so the year lent itself to discussions of the post-MDG period and aspirations for water and sustainable development. With the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), world Water Day gave specific emphasis to SDG 6, which calls for water and sanitation for all, by encouraging discussion of how SDG 6 could be achieved by 2030.\n\n[6] World Water Day: The theme also highlights how an abundance of quality water can change people's jobs and lives for the better. The 2016 celebration created recognition for those working to improve water quality and availability, and the need for many to transition to other and better jobs. Three out of four of the jobs worldwide are water-dependent. Water shortages and lack of access may limit economic growth in the years to come, according to the 2016 United Nations World Water Development Report.\n\n[7] World Water Day: UN-Water selects a theme for each year. The theme for 2018 was \"Nature for Water\" to encourage people to \"look for the answer in nature\". The theme encouraged the use of nature-based solutions to water-related challenges. For example, reducing floods, droughts, water pollution and protecting ecosystems could be solved using natural means, which nature uses, rather than man-made approaches.\n\n[8] World Water Day: The theme in 2018 explores how nature can be used to overcome the water challenges of the 21st century. This could be in the form of nature-based solutions to reduce floods, droughts and water pollution and protect ecosystems. Restoring wetlands, implementing constructed wetlands, green roofs, green infrastructure, planting new forests, reconnecting rivers to floodplains, are some examples. Each of these use natural processes to rebalance the water cycle and improve human health and livelihoods.\n\n[9] World Water Council: Every third year the World Water Council organizes the World Water Forum in close collaboration with the authorities of the hosting country. The Forum is the largest international event in the field of water. The 6th World Water Forum took place in Marseille, France, in 2012 and the 7th World Water Forum in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea, in April 2015. The 8th World Water Forum took place in Brasilia, Brazil, from 18 to 23 March 2018 under the overarching theme 'Sharing Water'. The 9th World Water Forum will take place in Dakar, Senegal, in March 2021.\n\n[10] World Toilet Day: UN-Water is the official convener of World Toilet Day. UN-Water maintains the official World Toilet Day website and chooses a special theme for each year. In 2018 the theme is nature-based solutions. Themes in previous years included wastewater, \"toilets and jobs\" and \"toilets and nutrition\". World Toilet Day is marked by communications campaigns and other activities. Events are planned by UN entities, international organizations, local civil society organizations and volunteers to raise awareness and inspire action.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWhat is the theme of the 2021’s World Water Day?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don'", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHow many moons does Neptune have?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Moons of Neptune: The inner moons are closely associated with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside the most prominent of Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50 km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.\n\n[2] Neptune XIV: Neptune's largest moon, Triton, has a retrograde and inclined orbit. It is hypothesized that Neptune captured it from the Kuiper belt well after Neptune's original satellite system formed. The pre-existing moons' orbits would have been shifted by this event, leading to the ejection of some moons and the collisional destruction of others. Neptune's present inner satellites are thought to have then accreted from the resulting rubble after Triton's orbit was circularized by tidal deceleration.\n\n[3] Moons of Neptune: Among the remaining irregular moons, Sao and Laomedeia follow prograde orbits, whereas Halimede, Psamathe and Neso follow retrograde orbits. Given the similarity of their orbits, it was suggested that Neso and Psamathe could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon. Psamathe and Neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar system to date. They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. Neptune has the largest Hill sphere in the Solar System, owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons. Nevertheless, Jupiter's S/2003 J 2 orbits at the greatest percentage of the primary's Hill radius of all the moons in the Solar System on average, and the Jovian moons in the Carme and Pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primary's Hill radius than Psamathe and Neso.\n\n[4] Neptune: From July to September 1989, \"Voyager 2\" discovered six moons of Neptune. Of these, the irregularly shaped Proteus is notable for being as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Although the second-most-massive Neptunian moon, it is only 0.25% the mass of Triton. Neptune's innermost four moons—Naiad, Thalassa, Despina and Galatea—orbit close enough to be within Neptune's rings. The next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring arcs, but when \"Voyager 2\" observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004. A new moon and the smallest yet, Neptune XIV, was found in 2013. Because Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.\n\n[5] Moons of Neptune: Triton is unique among moons of planetary mass in that its orbit is retrograde to Neptune's rotation and inclined relative to Neptune's equator, which suggests that it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it. The next-largest irregular satellite in the Solar System, Saturn's moon Phoebe, has only 0.03% of Triton's mass. The capture of Triton, probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system, was a catastrophic event for Neptune's original satellites, disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc. Triton is massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.\n\n[6] Solar eclipses on Neptune: Just because the moons are large enough to fully eclipse the Sun does not necessarily mean that they will do so. Eclipses of the Sun from Neptune are rare due to the planet's long orbital period and large axial tilt of 28 degrees. In addition, the largest moon, Triton, has an orbital inclination of about 25 degrees to Neptune's equator. This makes eclipses of the Sun by Triton rare. Even when such an eclipse does occur, it passes rather quickly, as Triton moves in the opposite direction of Neptune's spin.\n\n[7] Space exploration: Although the extremely uniform appearance of Uranus during \"Voyager 2\"s visit in 1986 had led to expectations that Neptune would also have few visible atmospheric phenomena, the spacecraft found that Neptune had obvious banding, visible clouds, auroras, and even a conspicuous anticyclone storm system rivaled in size only by Jupiter's small Spot. Neptune also proved to have the fastest winds of any planet in the Solar System, measured as high as 2,100 km/h. \"Voyager 2\" also examined Neptune's ring and moon system. It discovered 900 complete rings and additional partial ring \"arcs\" around Neptune. In addition to examining Neptune's three previously known moons, \"Voyager 2\" also discovered five previously unknown moons, one of which, Proteus, proved to be the last largest moon in the system. Data from \"Voyager 2\" supported the view that Neptune's largest moon, Triton, is a captured Kuiper belt object.\n\n[8] Moons of Neptune: No further moons were found until \"Voyager 2\" flew by Neptune in 1989. \"Voyager 2\" rediscovered Larissa and discovered five inner moons: Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea and Proteus. In 2001 two surveys using large ground-based telescopes found five additional outer moons, bringing the total to thirteen. Follow-up surveys by two teams in 2002 and 2003 respectively re-observed all five of these moons, which are Halimede, Sao, Psamathe, Laomedeia, and Neso. A sixth candidate moon was also found in the 2002 survey and was lost thereafter: it may have been a centaur instead of a satellite, although its small amount of motion relative to Neptune over a month suggests that it was indeed a satellite. It was estimated to have a diameter of 33 km and to have been about 25.1 million km (0.168 AU) from Neptune when it was found.\n\n[9] Moons of Neptune: In order of distance from Neptune, the regular moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, Neptune XIV, and Proteus. All but the outer two are within Neptune-synchronous orbit (Neptune's rotational period is 0.6713 day) and thus are being tidally decelerated. Naiad, the closest regular moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of Neptune XIV), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune.\n\n[10] Regular moon: There are at least 57 regular satellites of the eight planets: one at Earth, eight at Jupiter, 23 named regular moons at Saturn (not counting hundreds or thousands of moonlets), 18 known at Uranus, and 7 small regular moons at Neptune (Neptune's largest moon Triton appears to have been captured). It is thought that Pluto's five moons and Haumea's two were formed in orbit about those dwarf planets out of debris created in giant collisions.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the heaviest gas?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Hydramatic: The all cast-iron Hydramatic was the heaviest automatic transmission ever produced for automobiles. The heaviest of them all was the Truck Hydra-Matic version offered by GM Truck and Coach Division in its line of light- and medium-duty trucks and conventional buses, as well as with its transverse mounted gas L6 engined transit buses produced until 1963. That particular version weighed in at an incredible 655 pounds, when equipped with the angle drive for the transit bus application, while the 3⁄4 ton and up pickup truck model (HM270) still tipped the scale at a solid 435 pounds. When coupled to GMC's heavy V6 powerplant of 1960-1962, the powertrain weight was not too much lighter than the weight of the entire body of a 3⁄4 ton P-2500 model pickup truck. Even its successor, the Controlled Coupling Hydramatic was reviled by shop mechanics having to remove or reinstall such a unit, as they, too, were quite heavy when compared to other contemporary units. In the end, the true Hydramatic was rendered obsolete because of its cost, both in raw materials used as well as the machining needed. The successor, Turbo Hydramatic, was a much simpler, lighter and cheaper, if less efficient, transmission.\n\n[2] Scuba set: Rebreather divers and some open-circuit scuba divers carry extra diving cylinders for bailout in case the main breathing gas supply is used up or malfunctions. If the bailout cylinder is small, they may be called \"pony cylinders\". They have their own demand regulators and mouthpieces, and are technically distinct extra scuba sets. In technical diving, the diver may carry different equipment for different phases of the dive. Some breathing gas mixes, such as trimix, may only be used at depth, and others, such as pure oxygen, may only be used during decompression stops in shallow water. The heaviest cylinders are generally carried on the back supported by a backplate while others are side slung from strong points on the harness.\n\n[3] Nonmetal: Oganesson, the heaviest element on the periodic table, has only recently been synthesized. Owing to its short half-life, its chemical properties have not yet been investigated. Due to the significant relativistic destabilisation of the 7p orbitals, it is expected to be significantly reactive and behave more similarly to the group 14 elements, as it effectively has four valence electrons outside a pseudo-noble gas core. Its boiling point is expected to be about 80±30 °C, so that it is probably neither noble nor a gas; as a liquid it is expected to have a density of about 5 g/cm. It is expected to have a barely positive electron affinity (estimated as 5 kJ/mol) and a moderate ionisation energy of about 860 kJ/mol, which is rather low for a nonmetal and close to those of the metalloids tellurium and astatine. The oganesson fluorides OgF and OgF are expected to show significant ionic character, suggesting that oganesson may have at least incipient metallic properties. The oxides of oganesson, OgO and OgO, are predicted to be amphoteric.\n\n[4] Plumbane: Plumbane is an unstable colorless gas and is the heaviest group IV hydride. Furthermore, plumbane has a tetrahedral (T) structure with an equilibrium distance between lead and hydrogen of 1.73 Å. By weight percent, the composition of plumbane is 1.91% hydrogen and 98.09% lead. In plumbane, the formal oxidation states of hydrogen and lead are -1 and +4, respectively, because the electronegativity of hydrogen is higher than that of lead. The stability of metal hydrides with the formula MH (M = C–Pb) decreases as the atomic number of M increases.\n\n[5] Buffer gas: In fluorescent lamps, mercury is used as the primary ion from which light is emitted. Krypton is the buffer gas used in conjunction with the mercury which is used to moderate the momentum of collisions of mercury ions in order to reduce the damage done to the electrodes in the fluorescent lamp. Generally speaking, the longest lasting lamps are those with the heaviest noble gases as buffer gases. Buffer gas loading techniques have been developed for use in cooling paramagnetic atoms and molecules at ultra-cold temperatures. The buffer gas most commonly used in this sort of application is helium. Buffer gas cooling can be used on just about any molecule, as long as the molecule is capable of surviving multiple collisions with low energy helium atoms, which most molecules are capable of doing. Buffer gas cooling is allowing the molecules of interest to be cooled through elastic collisions with a cold buffer gas inside a chamber. If there are enough collisions between the buffer gas and the other molecules of interest before the molecules hit the walls of the chamber and are gone, the buffer gas will sufficiently cool the atoms. Of the two isotopes of helium (He and He), the rarer He is sometimes used over He as it provides significantly higher vapor pressures and buffer gas density at sub-kelvin temperatures. Buffer gases are also commonly used in compressors used in power plants for supplying gas to gas\n\n[6] What Went Down: What Went Down is the fourth studio album by British rock band Foals, released on 28 August 2015 via Transgressive Records in the United Kingdom. The album is produced by James Ford, known for his work with Simian Mobile Disco, The Last Shadow Puppets and Arctic Monkeys amongst others. According to frontman Yannis Philippakis, it is slated to be their loudest and heaviest record to date. \"What Went Down\" debuted at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and at number 58 on the \"Billboard\" 200, making it their highest charting album in the United States to date. With the departure of bassist Walter Gervers on 05 January 2018, this album marked the last album to feature him on bass.\n\n[7] Flerovium: In the periodic table of the elements, it is a transactinide element in the p-block. It is a member of the 7th period and is the heaviest known member of the carbon group; it is also the heaviest element whose chemistry has been investigated. Initial chemical studies performed in 2007–2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases. More recent results show that flerovium's reaction with gold is similar to that of copernicium, showing that it is a very volatile element that may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure, that it would show metallic properties, consistent with it being the heavier homologue of lead, and that it would be the least reactive metal in group 14. The question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas is still unresolved as of 2018.\n\n[8] Flerovium: Flerovium is currently the heaviest element to have had its chemistry experimentally investigated, although the chemical investigations have so far not led to a conclusive result. Two experiments were performed in April–May 2007 in a joint FLNR-PSI collaboration aiming to study the chemistry of copernicium. The first experiment involved the reaction Pu(Ca,3n)Fl and the second the reaction Pu(Ca,4n)Fl: these reactions produce short-lived flerovium isotopes whose copernicium daughters would then be studied. The adsorption properties of the resultant atoms on a gold surface were compared with those of radon, as it was then expected that copernicium's full-shell electron configuration would lead to noble-gas like behaviour. Noble gases interact with metal surfaces very weakly, which is uncharacteristic of metals.\n\n[9] Thallium hydride: Thallium hydride is the simplest thallane. Thallium is the heaviest member of the Group 13 metals; the stability of group 13 hydrides decreases with increasing periodic number. This is commonly attributed to poor overlap of the metal valence orbitals with that of the 1s orbital of Hydrogen. Despite encouraging early reports, it is unlikely that a thallium hydride species has been isolated. Thallium hydrides have been observed only in matrix isolation studies; the infrared spectrum was obtained in the gas phase by laser ablation of thallium in the presence of hydrogen gas. This study confirmed aspects of ab initio calculations conducted by Schwerdtfeger which indicated the similar stability of thallium and indium hydrides. There has not been a confirmed isolation of a thallium hydride complex to date.\n\n[10] Inert gas: In gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW), inert gases are used to shield the tungsten from contamination. It also shields the fluid metal (created from the arc) from the reactive gases in air which can cause porosity in the solidified weld puddle. Inert gases are also used in gas metal arc welding (GMAW) for welding non-ferrous metals. Some gases which are not usually considered inert but which behave like inert gases in all the circumstances likely to be encountered in some use can often be used as a substitute for an inert gas. This is useful when an appropriate pseudo-inert gas can be found which is inexpensive and common. For example, carbon dioxide is sometimes used in gas mixtures for GMAW because it is not reactive to the weld pool created by arc welding. But it is reactive to the arc. The more carbon dioxide that is added to the inert gas, such as argon, will increase your penetration. The amount of carbon dioxide is often determined by what kind of transfer you will be using in GMAW. The most common is spray arc transfer, and the most commonly used gas mixture for spray arc transfer is 90% argon and 10% carbon dioxide. (Listed as many different names depending on the gas supplier).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the heaviest gas?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The members were wholesale dealers in wool or woollen cloth. The Company dominated the trade in Welsh cloth for many years, holding a virtual monopoly from the 16th century to the late 18th century. It lost its position when the roads were improved, making it practical for factors from Liverpool and elsewhere to travel into Wales and purchase cloth directly from the makers, and became irrelevant when the Industrial Revolution made trade guilds obsolete. Today it survives as a charity that runs almshouses in Shrewsbury.\n\n[2] Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury: With the accession in 1685 of James II Shrewsbury was appointed a captain in order to defeat the Monmouth rebellion, although he resigned his commission in 1687 after refusing to bow to pressure from James to convert back to the Catholic faith. Making contact with William of Orange, Shrewsbury's home became a meeting place for the opposition to James II and Shrewsbury was one of seven English statesmen to sign the invitation to William to invade England in June 1688. In September he fled England for Holland and returned with William to England in November. Shrewsbury was influential in the making of the Revolution Settlement, arguing strongly in favour of recognising William and Mary as sovereigns. However, in 1690 Shrewsbury resigned from William's government due to ill-health and opposition to the dissolution of Parliament and the dropping of the Bill that would have required an oath abjuring James as King. In opposition, Shrewsbury contacted the exiled Stuart court in France as a prelude to a Stuart restoration. However, in 1694 Shrewsbury returned to government and was prominent in persuading the House of Commons to vote for the funds needed for William's war against France. Ill-health led to his resignation in 1698 but he returned to the government in 1699 until resigning again in 1700.\n\n[3] Shrewsbury Abbey: The Abbey was founded in 1083 as a Benedictine monastery by the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, Roger de Montgomery. It grew to be one of the most important and influential abbeys in England, and an important centre of pilgrimage. Although much of the Abbey was destroyed in the 16th century, the nave survived as a parish church, and today serves as the mother church for the Parish of Holy Cross.\n\n[4] List of Shrewsbury Town F.C. seasons: Shrewsbury Town Football Club, a professional association football club based in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England, was founded in 1886. They first played league football in the inaugural Shropshire & District League for the 1890–91 season; they finished the season as runners-up and also won the Welsh Cup at the first attempt. After five seasons in the Shropshire & District League, they were admitted to the Birmingham & District League in 1895; they won their first league championship in that league in 1923. In 1937 they moved to the Midland Football League where they won the league three times out of the seven seasons they participated in. In 1950 they joined The Football League competing in its Third Division North for one season before being transferred to the South equivalent for the rest of their time in the third division. Shrewsbury played in the Third Division South until 1958–59, when they were placed in the Fourth Division on League reorganisation. They gained their first promotion in the same season after finishing fourth. They remained in The Football League, albeit in different divisions, until they were relegated to the Football Conference in 2003. It was in the Conference where Shrewsbury achieved their first play-off success, when they beat Aldershot Town in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw after extra time at the Britannia Stadium to win promotion back into the newly renamed Football League Two. Since then Shrewsbury have remain\n\n[5] Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery: Shrewsbury Museum and Art Gallery was founded in 1835 as the Museum of the Shropshire and North Wales Natural History and Antiquarian Society Society in Dogpole, Shrewsbury, England. In 1853 the collections were moved to Vaughan's Mansion on College Hill, which became known as the Shropshire and North Wales Museum. After 160 years and two subsequent homes the museum returned to Vaughan's Mansion and the Music Hall Complex after a major redevelopment of the site.\n\n[6] The Blackfriars of Shrewsbury: The Black Friars of Shrewsbury is a short historical book by Paul Marsden, the former Shrewsbury MP, about the Dominican friars who arrived in Shrewsbury, England, in 1230 and built a church, cloisters, Lady chapel and series of outbuildings.\n\n[7] Shrewsbury Canal: The Shrewsbury Canal (or Shrewsbury and Newport Canal) was a canal in Shropshire, England. Authorised in 1793, the main line from Trench to Shrewsbury was fully open by 1797, but it remained isolated from the rest of the canal network until 1835, when the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal built the Newport Branch from Norbury Junction to a new junction with the Shrewsbury Canal at Wappenshall. After ownership passed to a series of railway companies, the canal was officially abandoned in 1944; many sections have disappeared, though some bridges and other structures can still be found. There is an active campaign to preserve the remnants of the canal and to restore the Norbury to Shrewsbury line to navigation.\n\n[8] Shrewsbury: The Welsh besieged it in 1069, but were repelled by William the Conqueror. Roger de Montgomery was given the town as a gift from William, and built Shrewsbury Castle in 1074, taking the title of Earl. He founded Shrewsbury Abbey as a Benedictine monastery in 1083. The 3rd Earl, Robert of Bellême, was deposed in 1102 and the title forfeited, in consequence of rebelling against Henry I and joining the Duke of Normandy's invasion of England in 1101. In 1138, King Stephen successfully besieged the castle held by William FitzAlan for the Empress Maud during the period known as the Anarchy.\n\n[9] Shrewsbury Unitarian Church: Shrewsbury Unitarian Church is a Grade II listed building situated on the High Street in Shrewsbury, England. The meeting house was founded in its present site in 1662 by the Revd Francis Tallents and the Revd James Bryan, two dissenters ejected from their living at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury. It was destroyed by a mob of Jacobite supporters in 1715 but rebuilt the same year.\n\n[10] Shrewsbury Drapers Company: Shrewsbury in 1334 was the 7th wealthiest town in England outside of London, and was well situated to handle trade from north and central Wales in time of peace. The drapers took the role of middlemen when the trade in raw wool was replaced by trade in woollen cloth. In the late 12th and 13th centuries all trade in Shrewsbury was controlled by the Guild Merchants. By the late 14th century the drapers had become an independent guild with commercial, religious and political functions. In 1444 the drapers guild founded almshouses beside St Mary's Church that housed 13 residents. The Mercers' Company remained the richest and strongest trade organisation in Shrewsbury in the 15th century.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" after reading each context.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

More than 2000 years civilization have proved so far from Hindu temples in Sri Lanka. Hindus currently make up 12.60% of the Sri Lankan population, and are almost exclusively Tamils apart from small immigrant communities from India and Pakistan such as the Sindhis, Telugus and Malayalees. In the 1915 census they made up almost 25% of the population, which included the indentured labourers the British had brought. Due to emigration (over 1 million Sri Lankan Tamils have left the country since independence), today they are still a sizeable minority. Hinduism is dominant in the North and Eastern provinces, where there are predominantly Tamil people. Hinduism is also practised in the central regions (where there are significant numbers of people of Indian Tamil descent) as well as in the capital, Colombo. According to the government census of 2011, there are 2,554,606 Hindus in Sri Lanka constituting 12.6% of the country's population. During the Sri Lankan Civil War, many Tamils fled to other countries. There are Hindu temples abroad which were built by the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora to maintain their religion, tradition and culture.\n\n[2] Sri Sabaratnam: In April 1986 the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) banned TELO and set about killing its leader Sri Sabaratnam. Sabaratnam went on the run, fleeing from TELO's main base in Kalviyankadu to Neervely, then to Kopay and finally to Kondavil. The LTTE found out that he was in Kondavil and they, led by Kittu, cordoned off the area and started a house-to-house search, using loud hailers to warn local residents not to shelter Sabaratnam. On 6 May 1986 the LTTE discovered Sabaratnam in a tobacco field and Kittu shot him in the leg to prevent him escaping. Sabaratnam pleaded with Kittu for his life but Kittu shot him using a machine gun. Sabaratnam's bullet ridden body was displayed at Kondavil bus stand before being handed over to his family.\n\n[3] Protests against the Sri Lankan Civil War in Canada: On 9 June, Bob Rae was denied entry into Sri Lanka by Sri Lankan immigration officials at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo. Although reasons for rejection were generally found unclear, the Government of Sri Lanka cited Rae was \"a threat to national security and sympathetic to the Tamil Tigers rebel group\". On the issue, Rae stated: \"Sri Lanka is afraid of dialogue, afraid of discussion, afraid of engagement. If this is how they treat me, imagine how they treat people who can't speak out.\" Rae described Sri Lanka as \"a very dangerous place to be a journalist\" and that it is \"a very dangerous place to be any kind of Tamil right now\". The news sparked controversy for both Rae and Sri Lanka in Canada and made it to the headlines of newspapers in other countries.\n\n[4] Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam: Fighting continued throughout the 1990s, and was marked by two key assassinations carried out by the LTTE: those of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1993, using suicide bombers on both occasions. The fighting briefly halted in 1994 following the election of Chandrika Kumaratunga as President of Sri Lanka and the onset of peace talks, but fighting resumed after LTTE sank two Sri Lanka Navy Fast Attack Craft in April 1995. In a series of military operations that followed, the Sri Lanka Armed Forces recaptured the Jaffna Peninsula. Further offensives followed over the next three years, and the military captured large areas in the north of the country from the LTTE, including areas in the Vanni region, the town of Kilinochchi, and many smaller towns. From 1998 onward, the LTTE regained control of these areas, which culminated in the capture in April 2000 of the strategically important Elephant Pass base complex, located at the entrance of the Jaffna Peninsula, after prolonged fighting against the Sri Lanka Army.\n\n[5] China–Sri Lanka relations: The China–Sri Lanka relations refers to bilateral relations between the People's Republic of China and Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. There is a Chinese embassy located in Colombo and a Sri Lankan embassy situated in Beijing. Historical and cultural ties between the two countries extend back hundreds of years. Relations between both countries during the rule of Sri Lankan president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, resulted in many agreements and saw closer relations due to Rajapaksa's pro-China stance. Under current Sri Lankan president, Maithripala Sirisena, relations remain strong with Sirisena interested in balancing both Chinese and Indian influence in the country. Despite this, recent developments have shown a \"pro-China\" slant to Sri Lanka's current foreign policy evident in the continued Chinese investment in Sri Lanka and the country's support of China's position in the South China Sea dispute.\n\n[6] Protests against the Sri Lankan Civil War in Canada: After the march from Queen's Park, protests continued in front of the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, even after Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse declared a victory over the LTTE on 17 May, which officially marked the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Post-civil war, the goal of the protests were to ensure peace and better treatment of Tamil civilians and investigate war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka. Protests also continuously happened in front of the Consulate of the United States in Montreal. Protesters held non-stop protests, urging Stephen Harper, who had not yet given any remarks on protests, to make a statement on the issue and request immediate humanitarian aid to be sent to the island nation. The Canadian Tamil Congress urged the European Union for a unanimous investigation of war crimes. Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon reflected by announcing that \"Canada would work with the United States helping the United Nations deliver humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka.\" In the meantime, Toronto's Sinhalese community continued to hold counter-Tamil protests, claiming that they were in danger by the LTTE.\n\n[7] Lasantha Wickrematunge: Wickrematunge's assassination caused an international outcry. Reporters Without Borders said that \"Sri Lanka has lost its more talented, courageous and iconoclastic journalists,\" and said that “President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his associates and the government media are directly to blame because they incited hatred against him and allowed an outrageous level of impunity to develop as regards violence against the press\". President Mahinda Rajapaksa described the assassination as an attempt to discredit the government and said he was both grieved and shocked and stated that he had instructed a thorough police inquiry and called the assassination an international conspiracy. The opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe observed that it was part of an anti-democratic conspiracy and accused the government of attempting to silence its critics. The United National Party, Sri Lanka's main opposition party, also staged a demonstration in the parliament on 9 January to protest his killing. The assassination was condemned by Norway, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, India and Japan, the United Nations strongly condemned the assassination while the World Bank expressed its concerns over the attack. President Mahinda Rajapaksa told Time (magazine) about Wickrematunge: \"He was a good friend of mine. He had informed somebody to inform me that he was in danger. But unfortunately, I didn't get that message. I would have told him to go to the nearest police station. No one knows what\n\n[8] 2018 Sri Lankan constitutional crisis: With the presidential election in 2019 and parliamentary elections in 2020 coming President Sirisena and Rajapaksa's moves to consolidate power backfired due to the political and economic instability during this whole crisis. The turmoil angered many Sri Lankans and weakened both the president and Rajapaksa ahead of the polls. Senior political scientist Jayadeva Uyangoda, called President Sirisena and his party the SLFP the “ultimate casualties” of the crisis. It saw the split of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party when Rajapaksa and his loyalists broke away from the party days after being appointed Prime Minister and took up membership in the Rajapaksa-backed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. Prof. Uyangoda said Sirisena, after the crisis, has no independent power base with his party having been virtually absorbed by the pro-Rajapaksa SLPP. “Sirisena has proved to be the country's poorest political leader when it comes to political strategising,” Prof. Uyangoda told The Hindu. Rajapaksa and his allies continued to demand for early elections, but as they are seen as the chief architects of the recent political turmoil the Rajapaksa family will probably enter any race with considerably less popular support than it had before the crisis. The Rajapaksa's were surprised when they were unable to secure enough votes in Parliament to form a government and have admitted privately that the political crisis has hurt their chances in an election in the urban areas.\n\n[9] Cuba–Sri Lanka relations: The current government of Cuba and the government of Sri Lanka established ties shortly after Fidel Castro's ascent to power in 1959. Ties were officially made on July 29, 1959, and Cuba and Sri Lanka recently celebrated the golden jubilee of this occasion after fifty years of bilateral ties. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to recognize Cuba, when Che Guevara (then Industry Minister) visited Sri Lanka on a delegation to promote the sugar trade. The 2 countries had an unofficial relationship through trading in the late 1800s to early 1900s which was then made official in 1959. This resulted in mixed communities in both countries. There are currently many Sri Lankan medical students studying in Cuba, as well as Cuban sports trainers hired to work in Sri Lanka.\n\n[10] 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers: According to the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) arrived at Sri Lanka in July 1987. Their presence in the country was not very popular among the Sri Lankan public and the politicians. In January 1989, President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government was elected. President Premadasa's initial intention was to work out a peace plan with the LTTE, which was waging a bloody separatist campaign in the country's north and east. Premadasa too was unhappy with the Indian presence in Sri Lanka. In June 1989, he entered into a ceasefire agreement with the LTTE. In an attempt to win over its leadership, Premadasa transferred a large quantity of weapons to the organization (at their request), to fight against the IPKF. And in late 1989, Premadasa asked the IPKF to return, due to the adverse public opinion. Indian Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh consented and withdrew his force.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the answer to the question \"After many protesters in Sri Lanka, the president of the country fled to which country?\" based on the given contexts.\n\nNote: Please provide the answer as either \"Yes, answer is", "llama-2-7b-chat": "No, answer is not present.

Playhouse Square includes the State, Palace, Allen, Hanna, and Ohio theaters within what is known as the Cleveland Theater District. Playhouse Square's resident performing arts companies include Cleveland Play House, Cleveland State University Department of Theatre and Dance, and Great Lakes Theater Festival. The center hosts various Broadway musicals, special concerts, speaking engagements, and other events throughout the year.\n\n[2] Temple Theater (Meridian, Mississippi): The Hamasa Shrine Temple Theater, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, is a historic theater located at 2320 8th Street in Meridian, Mississippi. The Temple Theater was constructed in the Moorish Revival style and began screening silent films in 1928. The theater features a Byzantine motif, a swirl of marble fountains, and large bronze chandeliers. At the time of its construction, the theater contained one of the largest stages in the United States, second only to the Roxy Theater in New York City. The theater houses one of only two Robert Morton theatre organs still installed in their original locations in the State of Mississippi – the other being installed at the Saenger Theater in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Both organs are under the care and restoration efforts of the Magnolia Chapter of the American Theatre Organ Society (ATOS).\n\n[3] Infernal Bridegroom Productions: The Houston Theater District is the second largest in the United States, after New York, New York, boasting theaters of all sizes, from the LORT Alley Theatre, to midsize theaters such as Stages Repertory Theatre and Main Street Theater, and small nomadic theaters such as Mildred's Umbrella.\n\n[4] Tom Moyer: In 1966, Moyer opened Eastgate Theater in Portland, the first multi-screen theater in the region. During the 1970s and 1980s, he grew the theater chain throughout Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Nevada and California. By 1989, he owned 298 screens, making the chain the nation's tenth-largest theater circuit at the time, and the largest privately owned theater circuit in the United States. Moyer also purchased much of the land that theaters were on and later leased the land back to the theaters, spurring his interest in real estate.\n\n[5] Dinner theater: The \"Carousel Dinner Theatre\", opened in 1973 and moved to downtown Akron, Ohio in 1988 to what had been a Las Vegas-style nightclub. With 1200 seats, it was the largest dinner theater in the United States until it closed in 2009. The theater was a victim of the late 2000s US economic crisis.\n\n[6] Villa Theatre: In 2001, USA Today named the Villa Theater on a list of ten great classic theaters in the United States. This decision was criticized by some who said that the theater was run down and undeserving of the acknowledgment.\n\n[7] Carmike Cinemas: Carmike Cinemas was a motion picture exhibitor headquartered in Columbus, Georgia. As of March 2016, the company had 276 theaters with 2,954 screens in 41 states, and was the fourth largest movie theater in the United States. The company billed itself as \"America's Hometown Theatre\" and Carmike theaters were largely positioned in rural or suburban areas with populations under 200,000. The company's theaters operated under various names and generally had a name followed by the number of auditoriums at that location; for example, \"Carmike 15\".\n\n[8] Greater Cleveland: Playhouse Square Center is the epicenter of the Cleveland Theater District and the second largest theater district in the United States.In addition, Greater Cleveland has additional theaters throughout the region. Cleveland is home to the Cleveland Orchestra, widely considered one of the finest orchestras in the world, and often referred to as the finest in the United States. It is one of the \"Big Five\" major orchestras in the United States. The Orchestra plays at Severance Hall in University Circle during the winter and at Blossom Music Center in Cuyahoga Falls during the summer. The city is also home to the Cleveland Pops Orchestra.\n\n[9] Indian Hills Theater: The Indian Hills Theater in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, was built in 1962 as a movie theater showcasing films in the Cinerama wide-screen format. The theater's screen was the largest of its type in the United States. Despite the protests of local citizens, Hollywood legends, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the theater was demolished in 2001 by Nebraska Methodist Health System for a parking lot.\n\n[10] Movie theater: In North America, the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) is the largest exhibition trade organization in the world. According to their figures, the top four chains represent almost half of the theater screens in North America. In Canada, Cineplex Entertainment is the largest and movie theater company with 161 locations and 1,635 screens. The studios once controlled many theaters, but after the appearance of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", Congress passed the Neely Anti-Block Booking Act, which eventually broke the link between the studios and the theaters. Now, the top three chains in the U.S. are Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Inc and Cinemark Theatres. In 1995, Carmike was the largest chain in the United States- now, the major chains include AMC Entertainment Inc – 5,206 screens in 346 theaters, Cinemark Theatres – 4,457 screens in 334 theaters, Landmark Theatres – 220 screens in 54 theaters, Marcus Theatres – 681 screens in 53 theaters. National Amusements – 409 screens in 32 theaters and Regal Entertainment Group – 7,334 screens in 588 cinemas. In 2015 the United States had a total of 40,547 screens. In Mexico, the major chains are Cinepolis and Cinemex.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhat is the biggest theater in the United States?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nContext 1: Yes, answer is present\nContext 2: No, answer is not present\nContext 3: No, answer is not present\nContext 4: No, answer is not present\nContext 5: Yes,", "flan-t5-xxl": "No, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "\nI don't know.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHas RNA been proven?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] RNA silencing: While RNA silencing is an evolving class of mechanisms, a common theme is the fundamental relationship between small RNAs and gene expression. It has also been observed that the major RNA silencing pathways currently identified have mechanisms of action which may involve both post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) as well as chromatin-dependent gene silencing (CDGS) pathways. CDGS involves the assembly of small RNA complexes on nascent transcripts and is regarded as encompassing mechanisms of action which implicate transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) and co-transcriptional gene silencing (CTGS) events. This is significant at least because the evidence suggests that small RNAs play a role in the modulation of chromatin structure and TGS.\n\n[2] History of RNA biology: Messenger RNA precursors from a wide range of organisms can be edited before being translated into protein. In this process, non-encoded nucleotides may be inserted into specific sites in the RNA, and encoded nucleotides may be removed or replaced. RNA editing was first discovered within the mitochondria of kinetoplastid protozoans, where it has been shown to be extensive. For example, some protein-coding genes encode fewer than 50% of the nucleotides found within the mature, translated mRNA. Other RNA editing events are found in mammals, plants, bacteria and viruses. These latter editing events involve fewer nucleotide modifications, insertions and deletions than the events within kinetoplast DNA, but still have high biological significance for gene expression and its regulation.\n\n[3] RNA editing: It has been shown in previous studies that the only types of RNA editing seen in the plants' mitochondria and plastids are conversion of C-to-U and U-to-C (very rare). RNA-editing sites are found mainly in the coding regions of mRNA, introns, and other non-translated regions. In fact, RNA editing can restore the functionality of tRNA molecules. The editing sites are found primarily upstream of mitochondrial or plastid RNAs. While the specific positions for C to U RNA editing events have been fairly well studied in both the mitochondrion and plastid, the identity and organization of all proteins comprising the editosome have yet to be established. Members of the expansive PPR protein family have been shown to function as \"trans\"-acting factors for RNA sequence recognition. Specific members of the MORF (Multiple Organellar RNA editing Factor) family are also required for proper editing at several sites. As some of these MORF proteins have been shown to interact with members of the PPR family, it is possible MORF proteins are components of the editosome complex. An enzyme responsible for the trans- or deamination of the RNA transcript remains elusive, though it has been proposed that the PPR proteins may serve this function as well.\n\n[4] Antisense RNA: Unlike micF RNA being discovered by accident, the majority of asRNAs were discovered by genome wide searches for small regulatory RNAs and by transcriptome analysis. Conventionally, the first step involves computational predictions based on some known characteristics of asRNAs. During computational searches, the encoding regions are excluded. The regions that are predicted to have conserved RNA structures and act as orphan promoters and Rho-independent terminators are preferenced during analysis. Because computational searches focuses on the intergenic region, the asRNAs that are transcribed from the opposite strand of an encoding gene are likely to be missed using this method. To detect asRNA transcribed from the encoding region, oligonucleotide microarrays can be used. In this method, one or both strands of encoding genes can be used as probes. In addition to computational searches and microarrays, some asRNAs were discovered by sequencing cDNA clones as well as mapping promoter elements. Although many findings from the approaches mentioned above gave rise to a lot of possible asRNAs, only few were proven to be actual asRNAs via further functional tests. To minimize the number of false positive results, new approaches from recent years have been focusing on strand-specific transcription, chromatin binding noncoding RNAs and single cell studies.\n\n[5] RNA silencing: The scientific community has been quick to harness RNA silencing as a research tool. The strategic targeting of mRNA can provide a large amount of information about gene function and its ability to be turned on and off. Induced RNA silencing can serve as a controlled method for suppressing gene expression. Since the machinery is conserved across most eukaryotes, these experiments scale well to a range of model organisms. In practice, expressing synthetic short hairpin RNAs can be used to reach stable knock-down. If promoters can be made to express these designer short hairpin RNAs, the result is often potent, stable, and controlled gene knock-down in both in vitro and in vivo contexts. Short hairpin RNA vector systems can be seen as roughly analogous in scope to using cDNA overexpression systems. Overall, synthetic and natural small RNAs have proven to be an important tool for studying gene function in cells as well as animals.\n\n[6] RNA: At first, regulatory RNA was thought to be a eukaryotic phenomenon, a part of the explanation for why so much more transcription in higher organisms was seen than had been predicted. But as soon as researchers began to look for possible RNA regulators in bacteria, they turned up there as well. Currently, the ubiquitous nature of systems of RNA regulation of genes has been discussed as support for the RNA World theory. Bacterial small RNAs generally act via antisense pairing with mRNA to down-regulate its translation, either by affecting stability or affecting cis-binding ability. Riboswitches have also been discovered. They are cis-acting regulatory RNA sequences acting allosterically. They change shape when they bind metabolites so that they gain or lose the ability to bind chromatin to regulate expression of genes.\n\n[7] Lone Star virus: \"Lone Star virus's\" genome consist of negative, single-stranded RNA. It is in the \"Bunyaviridae\" family of viruses. Its genus is the \"Phlebovirus\" and its species name is \"Lone Star virus\". It has been proven to produce titers in human and monkey cells seventy-two hours after inoculation. Although it was discovered in 1967, it has never been genetically characterized.\n\n[8] RNAs present in environmental samples: RNAs that were identified in environmental sequence samples include the IMES-1, IMES-3, IMES-4, Whalefall-1, \"potC\", Termite-\"flg\" and Gut-1 RNA motifs. These RNA structures have not been detected in the genome of any known species. The IMES-2 RNA motif, GOLLD RNA motif and manA RNA motif were discovered using environmental DNA or RNA sequence samples, and are present in a small number of known species. Additional non-coding RNAs are predicted in marine environments, although no specific conserved secondary structures have been published for these other candidates. Other conserved RNA structures were originally detected using environmental sequence data, e.g., the glnA RNA motif, but were subsequently detected in numerous cultivated species of bacteria.\n\n[9] GOLLD RNA motif: Giant, Ornate, Lake- and Lactobacillales-Derived (GOLLD) RNA is a conserved RNA structure present in bacteria. GOLLD RNAs were originally detected based on metagenome sequences of DNA isolated from Lake Gatun in Panama. However, they are known to be present in at least eight strains of cultivated bacteria. GOLLD RNAs are extraordinarily large compared to other RNAs with a conserved, complex secondary structure, and average roughly 800 nucleotides. Such large, complex RNAs are often ribozymes, although the biochemical function of GOLLD RNAs remains unknown. The discovery of large RNAs like GOLLD RNAs among bacteria that are mostly uncultivated under laboratory conditions suggests that many other unusually large RNAs might be found in bacteria that have not yet been studied.\n\n[10] RNA interference: RNAi has varying effects in different species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Possibly because their saliva and gut juice is better at breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer have so far not been proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], and [9].\nNo, answer is not present in [4], [7], [8], or [10].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Has RNA been proven?\nYes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context 5.\n\nRationale:\n\nContext 5 states that \"RNA silencing has been harnessed as a research tool\" and that \"induced RNA silencing can serve as", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

It pitched a Franco-Spanish force of 28,000 under the Duke of Orleans and Antoni de Villarroel against a combined Catalan and British force of 5,140 infantry and 70 cavalry under Ignasi Minguella, Francesc Montagut and general Jones. It ended in the Franco-Spanish force conclusively taking the town and as a result ending the occupation of Valencia.\n\n[2] Attack on Orleans: \"Three miles offshore, in the direction of the arrow, was the scene of attack of a German submarine on a tug and barges July 21, 1918. Several shells struck the beach. This is the only section of the United States' coast shelled by the enemy during World War I.\" \"U-156\" got away and headed north, where it continued to attack other Allied ships. A few shells and craters were found on shore in Orleans and in the nearby marsh. Newspapers dubbed the engagement the \"Battle of Orleans\" and offered a reward for the discovery of submarine supply bases in the Bay of Fundy. The attack on Orleans was the only Central Powers attack on the contiguous United States during World War I. It was also the first time that the United States was shelled by artillery since the Siege of Fort Texas in 1846.\n\n[3] Siege of Oran (1556): The Siege of Oran of 1556 occurred when Ottoman troops from Algiers besieged the Spanish garrison in Oran. The siege, by land and sea, was unsuccessful and had to be lifted in August 1556 when the Ottoman fleet of 40 galleys was recalled for duty in the East Mediterranean.\n\n[4] Siege of Toulon (1707): The Siege of Toulon took place between 29 July to 21 August 1707 during the War of the Spanish Succession when an Allied land and sea force besieged the French naval base at Toulon. The siege failed, but the French sank their ships to prevent them being captured. Most of the ships were later refloated, but this cemented Allied naval control of the Western Mediterranean. After the failure of the Siege of Turin on 7 September, French forces in Piedmont withdrew across the Alps into the Savoyard territories of Villefranche and County of Savoy. Despite Cvictory at astiglione two days later, their garrisons in Lombardy were isolated and could not be reinforced. The March 1707 Convention of Milan between France and Austria surrendered Milan and other French-occupied towns in Lombardy to the Imperial army, with the garrisons given free passage back to France for use elsewhere.\n\n[5] Siege of Derry: The Siege of Derry was the first major event in the Williamite War in Ireland. The siege was preceded by a first attempt against the town by Jacobite forces on 7 December 1688 that was foiled when 13 apprentices shut the gates. The second attempt began when James II himself appeared before the walls on 18 April 1689 and lasted 105 days until 1 August. It ended after ships bringing food broke through to the town. The siege is commemorated yearly by the Protestant community.\n\n[6] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[7] Siege of Orleans (1563): The siege of Orleans was part of the First French War of Religion, a conflict provoked by the Massacre of Vassy by Catholic troops of the Duke of Guise on 1 March 1562. As a result, the Prince of Conde, military leader of the Reformers, moved into Orleans to turn it into one of his strongholds. The city became Protestant; only reformed worship was tolerated; its institutions (the governor, the city aldermen, etc.) became dominated by Protestants, the bishop was removed in April 1562 and churches were desecrated and relics destroyed.\n\n[8] Siege of Orleans (1563): In 1563, Catholic troops led by the Duke of Guise set out to recapture Orleans, the defence of which was entrusted to the brother of Admiral de Coligny, François de Coligny d'Andelot. On 18 February 1563, when the position of the besieged had become difficult, Poltrot de Mere, a convicted Protestant, assassinated François de Guise. This assassination precipitated a treaty between the two parties which led to the Edict of Amboise on 19 March 1563 and established peace between the two communities. Orleans continued to live under this treaty of conciliation until 1567.\n\n[9] Siege of Lille (1667): The work was done on the eastern edge of the river Becquerel, at the Thebes gate to the bastion Nobltur. The king personally led the siege. On 11 August Lunette, located in front of the gate Thebes, was taken by storm. On the night of 19 August preparations were completed. The attack was carried out simultaneously on the right by the Guard against the gates of Thebes and on the left by Picardy Orleans shelves at Bastion Nobltur. On 21 August the battery was finished. Their fire soon destroyed the battery door at Thebes, leading the defenders to build batteries on the bastions of St. Maurice and St. Mary Magdalene. In the latter was a famous battery Meunier that shelled longitudinal approaches to the position of the besieged. During this time, many fires were set. On 23 August besiegers built 4-gun batteries against Becquerel.\n\n[10] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H. Cockrum, Foram’s founder, chairman and CEO. “We wanted the most efficient office building ever designed, with no wasted space or wasted energy.

Recent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFBP5 and childhood environment to predict the severity of PTSD. Polymorphisms in FKBP5 have been associated with peritraumatic dissociation in mentally ill children. A study of highly traumatized African-American subjects from inner city primary-care clinics indicated 4 polymorphisms of the FKBP5 gene, each of these functional. The interaction between the polymorphisms and the severity of childhood abuse predicts the severity of the adult PTSD symptoms. A more recent study of the African-American population indicated that the TT genotype of the FKBP5 gene is associated with the highest risk of PTSD among those having experienced childhood adversity, however those with this genotype that experienced no childhood adversity had the lowest risk of PTSD. In addition alcohol dependence interacts with the FKBP5 polymorphisms and childhood adversity to increase the risk of PTSD in these populations. Emergency room expression of the FKPB5 mRNA following trauma was shown to indicate a later development of PTSD.\n\n[6] ᅱ: ᅱ is one of the Korean hangul.

Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the \"Knight's Tale\".

However this series would include members of the public rather than celebrities. On 18 April 2015, it was announced that Caroline Flack would be hosting the show. The series finally returned on 7 June 2015 with a live special showing the new Islanders enter the villa. During the series a number of guests entered the villa including Calum Best, who was one of the Islanders in the original series back in 2005, and went on to win the series. Mark Wright also made a guest appearance in this series DJing for Lauren Richardson's birthday party. The series ended on 15 July 2015 and was won by Jess Hayes and Max Morley. Islanders Cally Jane Beech and Luis Morrison became the first couple from the show to have a baby together.\n\n[2] Information security: Identification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement \"Hello, my name is John Doe\" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming \"I am the person the username belongs to\".\n\n[3] Like the Way I Do: Like many other songs on the album (\"Bring Me Some Water\", \"Similar Features\", \"Don't You Need\"...), \"Like the Way I Do\" deals with the non-monogamous relationship she was in at the time. In the lyrics she asks her lover, who had told her that she had a crush on someone else, what she sees in the other person and what that person is giving to her what she herself cannot: \"Tell me does she love you like the way I love you, does she stimulate you, attract and captivate you?\". In the verses she also accuses her lover of not putting enough effort on making the relationship work: \"You found out to love me you have to climb some fences\".\n\n[4] Dead Island: The night after a high-profile party, the four main characters (hereafter referred to as \"the survivors\"); rapper Sam B., hotel receptionist and spy for the Chinese government Xian Mei, former football-star Logan Carter, and ex-police officer Purna—are awakened by a voice over the emergency intercom system directing them to evacuate the hotel. They discover that the majority of the population have been overcome by a contagious and infectious plague, turning them into psychopathic, flesh-eating creatures. Briefly overcome by one of the infected, they are rescued by lifeguard John Sinamoi. The four survivors discover that they are apparently immune from infection, and with \"The Voice\" out of contact, the survivors are tasked by Sinamoi to try to find supplies and contact the outside world. As it becomes obvious that the resort lacks enough supplies to survive for long, Sinamoi instead has them travel to the city of Moresby to find help. The survivors take along Jin, the daughter of the bitten mechanic who modifies an armoured car they use to break out of the resort.\n\n[5] What Will Happen to Us: In Rome three friends end to give the exams in last year of grammar high school, and grant a lovely summer holiday in Greece, on the island of Santorini. Matteo is a young problematic and indifferent, which is hoping for a ransom of his controversial personality through love. Manuel is a gruff guy who hates his father, and hopes for a better future for himself, because he does not want to work at the pet store with her mother. Paolo is the more shy of the group, who is in search of himself and of love. In Greece the three know beautiful girls, however also suffer betrayals of love. At the end of the story, only Manuel discovers himself, becoming more loving and positive towards life.\n\n[6] Thiruvilaiyadal: The film's title is explained in an introductory voiceover. Greeting the audience, it quotes Shiva's literary epic of the same name. According to the narrator, Shiva does what he does to test the patience of his disciples; the god plays games, which evoke more devotion in the hearts of his worshippers. Therefore, the film's title refers to the games played by Shiva. Opening \"in medias res\", it has a nonlinear narrative.\n\n[7] Islands (miniseries): The miniseries features vocal performances courtesy of the show's regular crew: Jeremy Shada (who voices Finn the Human), John DiMaggio (who portrays Jake the Dog), Hynden Walch (who voices Princess Bubblegum), and Olivia Olson (who plays Marceline the Vampire Queen). Niki Yang (who voices the sentient video game console BMO) and Jackie Buscarino (who lends her voice to the recurring character Susan Strong) also play an integral part in the miniseries. The \"Adventure Time\" cast records their lines together as opposed to doing it individually. This is to capture more natural sounding dialogue among the characters. Hynden Walch has described these group session as akin to \"doing a play reading—a really, really out there play.\"\n\n[8] M. Scott Peck: Once through the cathexis stage, the work of love begins. It is not a feeling. It consists of what you do for another person. As Peck says in \"The Road Less Traveled\", \"Love is as love does.\" It is about giving yourself and the other person what they need to grow. It is about truly knowing and understanding them.\n\n[9] Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup: Buttercup (voiced by E. G. Daily in the What a Cartoon! episodes and the series and Jo Wyatt in the British dub) is the toughest of the three. Her personality ingredient is \"spice\", her signature color is green, and she has short black hair in a flip. She is a fun-loving tomboy who loves to get dirty, fights hard and plays rough; she does not plan and is all action. Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without a unique super power (aside from being able to curl her tongue as shown in the episode \"Nuthin' Special\"). McCracken originally wanted to name the character \"Bud\" until a friend suggested the name Buttercup. According to The Powerpuff Girls Movie, Buttercup really dislikes the name she was given and developed her surly personality at that point.\n\n[10] KXCI: 2000: Best Radio Station Personality, Runner Up - Hod Rod Ron \"Hot Rod Ron is one of those increasingly rare-to-come-by D.J.s who does what he does for the sheer love of the music.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" after reading each context.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the answer to the question?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nJustification:\nContext 7 specifically mentions Jeremy Shada (who voices Finn the Human) as part of the regular crew for the TV show Islands.

Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 3.9%.\n\n[5] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[6] Pontresina: In Pontresina about 62.6% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a \"Fachhochschule\").\n\n[7] Demographic history of Palestine (region): There are now in the whole of Palestine hardly 700,000 people, a population much less than that of the province of Gallilee alone in the time of Christ. Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or—a small number—are Protestants.\n\n[8] Pontresina: , the gender distribution of the population was 50.2% male and 49.8% female.

Early in the nineteenth century reconstruction/rediscovery of the Julier, Maloja and Albula Passes, which since the end of the Roman empire had become mere bridle paths, marked a lessening of the isolation of the Engadin. The Swiss postal service was founded in 1848 and inaugurated a stagecoach service providing, for the first time, a regularly operated transport network. The development was associated with a tourism surge. Early beneficiaries were Tarasp and St. Moritz, two resorts able to boast spa facilities, and it was in these two resorts that the first new hotels in the Engadin region were built.\n\n[10] Pontresina: The historical population is given in the following table: Most of the population () speaks German (57.7%), with Italian being second most common (16.1%) and Portuguese being third ( 9.0%). Until the 19th Century, the entire population spoke the Upper-Engadin Romansh dialect of Putèr. Due to increasing trade with the outside world, Romansh usage began to decline. In 1880, still 45.7% of the population spoke Romansh as a first language, decreasing to only 33.61% in 1900. The Romansh language continues to decline without an interruption (1941 26.7%, 1970 16.22%, 2000 7.94%).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the population of Pontresina?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe contexts do not contain the information about the population of Pontresina.

The following day after watching the film, Vedder began working on material. After three days, Vedder gave Penn a range of material to work with. Penn placed into the film what Vedder had given him, and Vedder then went on to work on more material that Penn could add to the film. Vedder said that Penn \"gave [him] a lot of freedom,\" and added that \"the biggest thing was trust, which was just kind of unspoken.\" Vedder also said that having to write songs based on a narrative \"simplified things.\" He said, \"There were fewer choices. The story was there and the scenes were there.\" Vedder said that the songwriting process \"grew\" as Penn would ask him for more material.\n\n[2] Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana: Pepe's originated the New Haven-style thin-crust apizza (closely related to Neapolitan-style Italian pizza) which he baked in a coal-fired brick pizza oven. Originally, Frank Pepe only made two varieties of pizza: the \"tomato pie\" (tomatoes with grated pecorino romano cheese, garlic, oregano, and olive oil) and the other with the addition of anchovy.\n\n[3] Pickled egg: A variant historically associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch is the pickled beet egg where whole beets, onions, vinegar, sugar, salt, cloves, and (optionally) a cinnamon stick are used as the brine. The eggs take on a pink or even purple colour from the beets and have a pleasant sweet and sour taste. Pickled red-beet eggs, long a common food at picnics and pot-lucks in the Pennsylvania Dutch country, have diffused into the folk cuisine of the surrounding \"English\" and become a popular snack that can be bought in supermarkets as far east as the Delaware River.\n\n[4] Food labelling in Canada: Rules specify what kinds of food are to be labelled by volume (most liquids), weight (most non-liquids), or count.According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the following foods are exempted from having to have a durable life or packaging date:\n\n[5] Fruitcake: Panforte is a chewy, dense Tuscan fruitcake dating back to 13th-century Siena. Panforte is strongly flavored with spices (Panforte means \"Strong-bread\") and baked in a shallow form. Genoa's fruitcake, a lower, denser but still crumbly variety, is called Pandolce (\"Sweet-bread\").\n\n[6] Kelly Writers House: \"Penn Appetit\" is a food magazine that includes all types of food writing: feature food stories, personal narratives related to food, political/opinion columns, food poetry, restaurant reviews, and more. They are also looking to include photography or other artistic work in the magazine. The goal of the publication is to expand the types of food writing done on campus, as well as to explore the food issues surrounding Penn and Philadelphia. In 2010 the magazine won Penn PubCo awards for Best Design, Best Leisure Article, and Best Overall Magazine.\n\n[7] Cuisine of Allentown, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Dutch foods are very popular. Most of the diners in the Lehigh Valley area still exhibit a strong Pennsylvania Dutch influence in their menus. Scrapple is a pudding formed of pork scraps and cornmeal, served sliced and fried. Liver pudding is made out of pig liver and head parts, mostly leftovers from the animal. Head cheese is parts of the head of a pig or calf that are made into a gelatin and mixed with vegetables. A variant is souse, made from pig's feet and pickled with vinegar. Chow-chow is a mixture of pickled vegetables made into a salad. It is usually sweeter than when it is made in the South. Lebanon bologna is a sausage that tastes more smoky than others. Cole slaw is usually served as a side with sandwiches. Apple butter can be used on toast or used as an ingredient in another food. Shoofly pie is a somewhat-sweet pie made out of molasses and sugar. Funnel cakes are found at fairs and festivals across the region. Fasnachts are made for the day before Lent begins. Many of these treats can be found at the Allentown Farmer's Market, locally based grocery stores, and local events like fairs.\n\n[8] Penn Fruit: However, rivals such as A&P, Food Fair (later known as Pantry Pride) and Acme were opening discount stores of their own, and in 1973 Acme's 173 Philadelphia-area stores launched a price war against Penn Fruit's 12 warehouse markets. This move set off a series of events that would lead to the latter's downfall. After nearly two years the bottom fell out. Penn Fruit, unable to compete, filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and began selling off most of its non-supermarket holdings. It then later closed all but a handful of its supermarkets, including the last of its Baltimore division (now called Big Valu), which were sold to Food A Rama, a local Baltimore chain (now part of Shoppers Food & Pharmacy, a Supervalu division) with the remaining 17 stores sold to Food Fair in 1975. Some of the former Penn Fruit stores became Shop 'n Bag stores, an old 'chain' of owner-operated co-operative business model. Penn Fruit continued as a division of Pantry Pride until the latter filed bankruptcy two years later, with those units being absorbed by a variety of competitors.\n\n[9] Khirachora Gopinatha Temple: In the corridor of the temple, from which people generally viewed the Deity, Madhavendra Puri chanted and danced. Then he sat down there and asked a brahmana what kinds of foods they offered to the Deity. Madhavendra Puri thought: \"I shall inquire from the priest what foods are offered to Gopinatha so that by making arrangements in our kitchen, we can also offer similar foods to Sri Gopala.\"\n\n[10] Pennsylvania: Among the regional foods associated with Philadelphia are cheesesteaks, hoagie, soft pretzels, Italian water ice, Irish potato candy, scrapple, Tastykake, Wawa, and strombolis. In Pittsburgh, tomato ketchup was improved by Henry John Heinz from 1876 to the early 20th century. Famous to a lesser extent than Heinz ketchup are the Pittsburgh's Primanti Brothers Restaurant sandwiches, pierogies, and city chicken. Outside of Scranton, in Old Forge there are dozens of Italian restaurants specializing in pizza made unique by thick, light crust and American cheese. Erie also has its share of unique foods, including Greek sauce and sponge candy. Sauerkraut along with pork and mashed potatoes is a common meal on New Year's Day in Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania has been known as the \"Keystone\" \"State\" since 1802, based in part upon its central location among the original Thirteen Colonies forming the United States, and also in part because of the number of important American documents signed in the state (such as the Declaration of Independence). It was also a keystone state economically, having both the industry common to the North (making such wares as Conestoga wagons and rifles) and the agriculture common to the South (producing feed, fiber, food, and tobacco).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\nNo answer is present in the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

In 2002, there were seven singles that topped the chart, the lowest number of singles to top the chart in a single year ever (if the two songs which peaked in 2001 are included, 2002 would have the second lowest number of chart-topping singles in a year, behind 2005).

Later that year, on December 4, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films, which were available on Netflix beginning in 2016. However, classics such as \"Dumbo\", \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Pocahontas\" were instantly available upon completion of the deal. Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013. The agreement with Disney is scheduled to end in 2019, as the company is preparing to launch a new streaming service that will carry all Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm releases. Netflix will retain rights to continue streaming the Marvel series that were produced for the service. With the Disney-Fox merger, movie and TV titles from 20th Century Fox will likely follow suit after their deal with Netflix expires, except \"Two Lovers and a Bear\", which Netflix will likely retain U.S streaming rights to as Fox and Netflix jointly acquired the U.S distribution rights to the film.\n\n[2] Stranger Things: In August 2017, the marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the seventh-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it was released, garnering slightly more than 20% of the viewers that the second season of \"Daredevil\" received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.\n\n[3] Iron Fist (season 1): Parrot later revealed that demand for \"Iron Fist\" a week after it launched was halved. This was the largest drop in retention for a Marvel Netflix series, indicating \"that people started binge-watching the show in its first few days and then didn't come back to finish the season the next weekend.\" The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the third-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 28% of the viewers that the second season of \"Daredevil\" received, which was the firm believed was the most viewed season. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.\n\n[4] List of original programs distributed by Netflix: These television shows, even though Netflix lists them as Netflix originals, are shows that have been aired in different countries, and Netflix has bought exclusive distribution rights to stream them in other various countries. They may be available on Netflix in their home territory and other markets where Netflix does not have the first run license, without the Netflix Original label, some time after their first-run airing on their original broadcaster.\n\n[5] 13 Reasons Why: The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the first season was the second-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 48% of the viewers that the second season of \"Daredevil\" received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. The series also showed an 18% increase in week-over-week viewership from week one to week two. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.\n\n[6] The Flash (season 3): In October 2016, it was announced that the season would be available for streaming on Netflix eight days after the season finale, part of the new CW-Netflix deal. The five most recent episodes are available to stream for free on the new mobile CW app, instead of on Hulu like the previous two seasons. The season began streaming on Netflix on May 31, 2017, and was released on Blu-ray and DVD in Region 1 on September 5, 2017.\n\n[7] The Defenders (miniseries): As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, the marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the series garnered 17% of the viewers that the second season of \"Daredevil\" received in its first 30 days, which was the most viewed season according to the firm. \"The Defenders\" was, comparably, the least-viewed of the Marvel Netflix series and had the largest week-over-week drop in viewership, declining by 67%, 48%, and 41%, respectively, over the 30-day period. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes anonymized click-stream data from a panel of more than 100 million internet consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season. The data excludes viewing that occurred on Netflix's connected TV or mobile apps.\n\n[8] Wentworth (TV series): In December 2014, \"Wentworth\" first premiered on Netflix in the United States and added seasons one and two to its streaming service. In April 2016 the third season was released to US audiences via the platform. Season 4 was released on Netflix in July 2016. The show features on the “50 Best TV Shows on Netflix” list according to Netflix Life. Seasons one to three are available to view via Amazon Video in the U.S.\n\n[9] Netflix: In February 2013, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix co-produced \"Turbo FAST\", based on the movie \"Turbo\", which premiered in July. Netflix has since become a major distributor of animated family and kid shows. \"Orange Is the New Black\" debuted on the streaming service in July 2013. In a rare discussion of a Netflix show's ratings, Netflix executives have commented that the show is Netflix's most-watched original series. In February 2016, \"Orange Is the New Black\" was renewed for a fifth, sixth and seventh season. On June 9, 2017, season 5 was premiered and the sixth season premiered on July 27, 2018.\n\n[10] Orange Is the New Black: \"Orange Is the New Black\" generated more viewers and hours viewed in its first week than the other top Netflix original series \"House of Cards\" and \"Arrested Development\". In October 2013, Netflix stated that the show is a \"tremendous success\" for the streaming platform. \"It will end the year as our most watched original series ever and, as with each of our other previously launched originals, enjoys an audience comparable with successful shows on cable and broadcast TV.\" As reported in February 2016, \"Orange Is the New Black\" remains Netflix's most-watched original series. In 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"Orange Is the New Black\" is one of the shows most watched in urban areas, and despite its \"minority-rich ensemble cast,\" the series \"appeals more to a white audience.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWhat was the most streamed show on Netflix in 2020?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhere in the world would you expect to find a car with the vehicle registration code ‘V’?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Vehicle registration plates of France: Numbers from 1 to 10 and numbers identical to the code (such as 24 VQ 24) were not used after 1976. As with the SIV system, The letters I and O were never used because they could be confused with other characters, like 1 and 0. U was excluded as well in 1984, similar to the letter V, but some départements issued registration plates containing that letter until 1991. The letter O was exceptionally used on official cars at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Such cars had registration plates with figures between 1 JO 73 and 9999 JO 73. \"JO\" stands for \"Jeux olympiques\" while \"73\" is the code for Savoie where the games took place. Offensive letter combinations, for instance SS, PD, PQ QQ, KK or WC, were avoided by some either because of historical reasons or because they sound vulgar to French speakers. In the same way, Haute-Garonne did not deliver car plates with \"AZF\" after the tragic explosion of the AZF factory in Toulouse in 2001. MMM, MMW, MWM and MWW were withdrawn in 1994 because they needed too much space on plates.\n\n[2] List of country codes on British diplomatic vehicle registration plates: Since 1979 cars operated by foreign embassies, high commissions, consulates and international organisations are issued unique vehicle registration marks with a distinguishing format of three numbers, space, letter D or X, space and three numbers. The letter D is predominately used for vehicles operated in or around the capital of London with the letter X allocated to vehicles outside London and for international organisations, unless otherwise stated by bilateral treaty or arrangement.\n\n[3] Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom: Normally the last two letters would indicate where the car was initially registered. The letters I and Z are reserved for Ireland. If you want to look for the office code (or council code until 1974) easier, look at the bold letters next to the examples (ABC 123\"D\"; \"A\"123 BCD). Note that pre 2001 number plates where the last two letters indicate the original district of registration is not the same as the 1st two letters of the post 2001 system so For example pre 2001 AB is Worcester Whereas post 2001 AB is Peterborough.\n\n[4] Vehicle registration plates of the Netherlands: Since January 1, 2014, the Netherlands has an all plastic vehicle registration on credit card format. This and the driving licence (which is the same size) are the only things needed to bring along while driving in the Netherlands. This registration has the same green appearance for every vehicle category, only the information on the card differs. It has a chip with more detailed information about the vehicle. All previously issued vehicle registrations will remain valid until the car changes ownership, or until when the owner requests replacement vehicle registration documents. While a so-called \"overschrijvingsbewijs\" (a separate document that came with the vehicle registration) was needed previously to sell the vehicle, this has now been replaced with a code. The registration card and the correct code are enough to sell the vehicle, even without the original letter stating the code as issued during in new car registrations.\n\n[5] Vehicle registration plates of India: The union territory of Delhi has an additional code in the registration code: DL 9 CAA 1111 where DL is the two letter code for Delhi (DL). The additional C (for category of vehicle) is the letter S for two-wheelers, C for cars and SUVs, E for electric vehicles (in some cases only), P for public passenger vehicles such as buses, R for three-wheeled rickshaws, T for tourist-licensed vehicles and taxis, V for pick-up trucks and vans and Y for hire vehicles. This system is also applicable in other states. (For example, Rajasthan, where RJ is the two letter code, P is for passenger vehicles, C for cars, S for scooters and G for goods vehicles.)\n\n[6] Vehicle registration plates of France: Cars bought before 2009 can still bear the old format, dating from 1950, if the owner has not moved to a different département since then. Unlike the new one, the 1950 format is geographical. Until 2009, car plates had to be changed whenever the owner moved to another département or bought a car from a person living in a different département. The 1950 format uses a N X NN format, composed of a series of one to four numbers, one to three letters and a two-digit code corresponding to the département where the car is registered. The international code for French plates is \"F\" (France).\n\n[7] Vehicle registration plates of Switzerland: In most cantons, it is possible to find any license plate with the same number in different colors. The colors are different kinds of use or vehicle types.Only official car dealer / car repair companies can use the \"U\" plates. Usually they use this plate for only a few days on one vehicle. This \"U\" plate can be used on trucks and cars no matter what engine power or pollution rating the vehicle has. The plate can be placed on the standard position as like a car plate is based on a vehicle, but it is also possible to fix it with a magnetic device on the hood and on the vehicle's rear. Because of a European regulation (identification as a rental car should not be possible for everyone), the plates with the \"V\" are no longer in use. Today, rental cars usually have common car plates with the canton codes VD or AI. Temporary duty unpaid vehicles use \"Z\" plates and year band while Temporary duty paid plate have year band on the right. Taxi cabs are generally given three- or four-digit registration numbers. This is to allow telephone reservation customers easy identification of the promised car when it arrives for the pick-up.\n\n[8] Vehicle registration plates of Europe: A metal or plastic plate or plates attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes. The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority's database. In Europe most countries have adopted a common format for number plates, such as the common EU format issued in EU member states. This format satisfies the requirements in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which states that cross-border vehicles must display a distinguishing code for the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may be an oval sticker placed separately from the registration plate, or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation to which the country belongs.\n\n[9] International vehicle registration code: The Vienna Convention on Road Traffic was concluded in Vienna on 8 November 1968. Since its entry into force on 21 May 1977, in signatory countries it replaces previous road traffic conventions, notably the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, in accordance with its Article 48. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. When driving in other signatory countries, the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate as a white oval plate or sticker, or be incorporated in the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated in the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle. The requirement to display a separate distinguishing sign is not necessary within the European Economic Area, for vehicles with license plates in the common EU format which satisfy the requirements of the Vienna Convention, and so are also valid in non-EU countries signatory to the convention. Separate signs are also not needed for Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the province, state or district of registration is usually embossed or surface-printed on the vehicle registration plate. There are unofficial codes in common use, such as \"AS\" for Asturias, \"CAT\" for Catalonia, \"CYM\" for Wales, \"BZH\" for Brittany, \"VL\" for Flanders, \"V\" for Vojvodina/Vajdaság\n\n[10] Passenger vehicles in the United States: The VIN identifies the vehicle's country of manufacture, and the company responsible for its production. Vehicles manufactured in the United States have VINs beginning with the numbers 1, 4, and 5 — regardless of where the company is based. If a motor vehicle is manufactured in Canada, the VIN begins with the number 2. Thus, a Toyota Camry made in the U.S. will have a 1, 4, or 5 at the start of its VIN, while one imported from Japan will begin with the letter J.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhere in the world would you expect to find a car with the vehicle registration code 'V'?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each question.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "No, answer is not present.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\nExplanation:\nThe contexts do not provide enough information to answer the question definitively.

The universal priesthood was for Melanchthon as for Luther no principle of an ecclesiastical constitution, but a purely religious principle. In accordance with this idea Melanchthon tried to keep the traditional church constitution and government, including the bishops. He did not want, however, a church altogether independent of the state, but rather, in agreement with Luther, he believed it the duty of the secular authorities to protect religion and the church. He looked upon the consistories as ecclesiastical courts which therefore should be composed of spiritual and secular judges, for to him the official authority of the church did not lie in a special class of priests, but rather in the whole congregation, to be represented therefore not only by ecclesiastics, but also by laymen. Melanchthon in advocating church union did not overlook differences in doctrine for the sake of common practical tasks.\n\n[2] Philip Melanchthon: Melanchthon wrote numerous treatises dealing with education and learning that present some of his key thoughts on learning, including his views on the basis, method, and goal of reformed education. In his \"Book of Visitation\", Melanchthon outlines a school plan that recommends schools to teach Latin only. Here he suggests children should be broken up into three distinct groups: children who are learning to read, children who know how to read and are ready to learn grammar, and children who are well-trained in grammar and syntax. Melanchthon also believed that the disciplinary system of the classical \"seven liberal arts\", and the sciences studied in the higher faculties could not encompass the new revolutionary discoveries of the age in terms of either content or method. He expanded the traditional categorization of science in several directions, incorporating not only history, geography and poetry but also the new natural sciences in his system of scholarly disciplines.\n\n[3] Philip Melanchthon: The composition now known as the \"Augsburg Confession\" was laid before the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, and would come to be considered perhaps the most significant document of the Protestant Reformation. While the confession was based on Luther's Marburg and Schwabach articles, it was mainly the work of Melanchthon; although it was commonly thought of as a unified statement of doctrine by the two reformers, Luther did not conceal his dissatisfaction with its irenic tone. Indeed, some would criticize Melanchthon's conduct at the Diet as unbecoming of the principle he promoted, implying that faith in the truth of his cause should logically have inspired Melanchthon to a firmer and more dignified posture. Others point out that he had not sought the part of a political leader, suggesting that he seemed to lack the requisite energy and decision for such a role and may simply have been a lackluster judge of human nature.\n\n[4] Philip Melanchthon: As a reformer, Melanchthon was characterized by moderation, conscientiousness, caution, and love of peace; but these qualities were sometimes said to only be lack of decision, consistence, and courage. Often, however, his actions are shown stemming not from anxiety for his own safety, but from regard for the welfare of the community and for the quiet development of the church. Melanchthon was not said to lack personal courage, but rather he was said to be less of an aggressive than of a passive nature. When he was reminded how much power and strength Luther drew from his trust in God, he answered, \"If I myself do not do my part, I can not expect anything from God in prayer.\" His nature was seen to be inclined to suffer with faith in God that he would be released from every evil rather than to act valiantly with his aid. The distinction between Luther and Melanchthon is well brought out in Luther's letters to the latter (June 1530):\n\n[5] Philip Melanchthon: On the other hand, Luther wrote of Melanchthon, in the preface to Melanchthon's \"Commentary on the Galatians\" (1529), \"I had to fight with rabble and devils, for which reason my books are very warlike. I am the rough pioneer who must break the road; but Master Philip comes along softly and gently, sows and waters heartily, since God has richly endowed him with gifts.\" Luther also did justice to Melanchthon's teachings, praising one year before his death in the preface to his own writings Melanchthon's revised \"Loci\" above them and calling Melanchthon \"a divine instrument which has achieved the very best in the department of theology to the great rage of the devil and his scabby tribe.\" It is remarkable that Luther, who vehemently attacked men like Erasmus and Bucer, when he thought that truth was at stake, never spoke directly against Melanchthon, and even during his melancholy last years conquered his temper.\n\n[6] Philip Melanchthon: The last years of his life were embittered by the disputes over the Interim and the freshly started controversy on the Lord's Supper. As the statement \"good works are necessary for salvation\" appeared in the Leipzig Interim, its Lutheran opponents attacked in 1551 Georg Major, the friend and disciple of Melanchthon, so Melanchthon dropped the formula altogether, seeing how easily it could be misunderstood.\n\n[7] Philip Melanchthon: More than anything else the controversies on the Lord's Supper embittered the last years of his life. The renewal of this dispute was due to the victory in the Reformed Church of the Calvinistic doctrine and its influence upon Germany. To its tenets Melanchthon never gave his assent, nor did he use its characteristic formulas. The personal presence and self-impartation of Christ in the Lord's Supper were especially important for Melanchthon; but he did not definitely state how body and blood are related to this. Although rejecting the physical act of mastication, he nevertheless assumed the real presence of the body of Christ and therefore also a real self-impartation. Melanchthon differed from John Calvin also in emphasizing the relation of the Lord's Supper to justification.\n\n[8] Philip Melanchthon: On a journey in 1524 to his native town, he encountered the papal legate, Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, who tried to draw him from Luther's cause. In his \"Unterricht der Visitatorn an die Pfarherrn im Kurfürstentum zu Sachssen\" (1528) Melanchthon presented the evangelical doctrine of salvation as well as regulations for churches and schools.\n\n[9] Philip Melanchthon: Both were aware of their mutual position and they thought of it as a divine necessity of their common calling. Melanchthon wrote in 1520, \"I would rather die than be separated from Luther\", whom he afterward compared to Elijah, and called \"the man full of the Holy Ghost\". In spite of the strained relations between them in the last years of Luther's life, Melanchthon exclaimed at Luther's death, \"Dead is the horseman and chariot of Israel who ruled the church in this last age of the world!\"\n\n[10] Philip Melanchthon: But all his caution and reservation did not hinder his opponents from continually working against him, accusing him of synergism and Zwinglianism. At the Colloquy of Worms in 1557 which he attended only reluctantly, the adherents of Flacius and the Saxon theologians tried to avenge themselves by thoroughly humiliating Melanchthon, in agreement with the malicious desire of the Roman Catholics to condemn all heretics, especially those who had departed from the Augsburg Confession, before the beginning of the conference. As this was directed against Melanchthon himself, he protested, so that his opponents left, greatly to the satisfaction of the Roman Catholics who now broke off the colloquy, throwing all blame upon the Protestants. The Reformation in the sixteenth century did not experience a greater insult, as Friedrich Nietzsche says. Nevertheless, Melanchthon persevered in his efforts for the peace of the church, suggesting a synod of the Evangelical party and drawing up for the same purpose the Frankfurt Recess, which he defended later against the attacks of his enemies.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nPlease let me know if you want me to answer any of the other questions.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad. On 14 June 2018, he played a crucial role in Russia's 5–0 victory over Saudi Arabia making two assists and scoring the final goal, a free-kick in the opening match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n\n[2] Russia at the FIFA World Cup: Russia has participated in 4 FIFA World Cups since its independence in December 1991. The Russian Federation played their first international match against Mexico on 16 August 1992 winning 2-0. Their first participation in a World Cup was the United States of America in 1994 and they achieved 18th place. In 1946 the Soviet Union was accepted by FIFA and played their first World Cup in Sweden 1958. The Soviet Union represented 15 Socialist republics and various football federations, and the majority of players came from the Dynamo Kyiv team of the Ukrainian SSR. The Soviet Union national football team played in 7 World Cups. Their best performance was reaching 4th place in England 1966. However Soviet football was dissolved in 1991 when Belarus, Russia and Ukraine declared independence under the Belavezha Accords. The CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States) was formed with other independent nations in 1992 but did not participate in any World Cups.\n\n[3] Nizhny Novgorod: Several sports clubs are active in the city: Russia hosted the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and six matches were played at the new Nizhny Novgorod Stadium. The stadium is built beside the confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers and has a capacity of 44,899 people. The stadium hosted 6 matches of the FIFA World Cup: During the World Cup, the Minin and Pozharsky Square hosted the FIFA Fan Fest. The venue was open on game days from 13.00 till 00.00. The Fan Fest venue included a hospitality area, a folk art craft shop and food outlets (20 stationary and 7 mobile outlets). The games were broadcast on a big screen.\n\n[4] Russia national football team: On 2 December 2010, Russia were selected to host the 2018 World Cup and automatically qualified for the tournament. During the friendly matches prior to the tournament, Russia did not have good results. The team lost more games than it won and this made their FIFA ranking fall to 70th, the lowest among all World Cup participants. Russia were drawn to play Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Uruguay in the group stage. Despite a series of poor results in warm-up games, however, Russia began their World Cup campaign with a 5–0 demolition of Saudi Arabia, who were three places above them in the rankings, on 14 June in the opening match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. On 19 June, Russia won their second game of the group stage, beating Egypt by a scoreline of 3–1, taking their goal difference to +7 with only two matches played. The win over Egypt all but secured Russia's advancement into the knockout stage for the first time since 1986, when they played as the Soviet Union; and also for the first time in their history as an independent state. They officially qualified for the knockout stage the next day, following Uruguay's 1–0 win over Saudi Arabia. Russia's final group game was against two-time world champions (1930 and 1950) and powerhouse Uruguay, with Russia losing 3–0, meaning that they would finish second in the group.\n\n[5] 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup: Russia was announced as the host on 2 December 2010 after the country was awarded the hosting rights of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were played in four different stadiums across four cities: Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, and Sochi. It was the first time Russia has hosted the tournament, and the third time the Confederations Cup has been held in the European continent. As hosts, Russia qualified automatically for the tournament; they were joined by the six winners of the FIFA confederation championships and the 2014 FIFA World Cup champions, Germany.\n\n[6] Mário Fernandes (footballer): On 11 May 2018, he was included in Russia's extended 2018 FIFA World Cup squad. On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad. He played a key role in Russia's performance at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In the quarter finals against Croatia, he scored an equalising goal in extra time, which sent the match to a penalty shootout. However, Russia was eliminated after losing the shootout.\n\n[7] Football Association of Malaysia: FIFA’s Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) after serious crowd disturbances led to the abandonment of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia qualifying match between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia on Saturday 8 September. After analysis of all the circumstances of the matter, in particular, the match officials’ reports, FAM’s positions as well as the relevant videos and pictures, and due to the seriousness of the incidents, the Disciplinary Committee decided that the next home match of the ‘A’ representative team of Malaysia in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition (Malaysia v UAE on 17 November 2015) will be played without spectators. The committee also decided to impose a fine of CHF 40,000 (RM 180,000) and issue FAM with a warning. Furthermore, the Disciplinary Committee decided that the match be declared to be lost by forfeit by Malaysia (0–3).\n\n[8] Russia: Russia was the host nation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The matches were held from June 14 to July 15, 2018 in the stadiums of 11 various Russian cities, namely, Kaliningrad, Kazan, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd and Yekaterinburg. This was the first football World Cup ever held in Eastern Europe, and the first held in Europe since 2006. Russia will also host games of the Euro 2020.\n\n[9] 2018 FIFA World Cup Final: The 2018 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match that took place on 15 July 2018 to determine the winners of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. It was the final of the 21st FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The match was contested by France and Croatia, and held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia.\n\n[10] Yury Gazinsky: On 11 May 2018, he was included in Russia's extended 2018 FIFA World Cup squad. On 3 June 2018, he was included in the finalized World Cup squad. On 14 June 2018, he scored the first goal of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in the 12th minute of the opening match against Saudi Arabia. Russia went on to win the match 5–0. He stayed on the bench in the Round of 16 defeat of Spain before appearing as a substitute in the quarterfinal shoot-out loss to Croatia.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the answer to the following question:\nHow many football matches were played in total in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia?\n\nNote: Please answer based on the information provided in the given contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question: How many football matches were played in total in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nCONTEXT EXPLANATION:\nThe answer can be found in context [4].

It is named after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802–1829) and directly modeled after the Nobel Prizes. It comes with a monetary award of 6 million Norwegian kroner (NOK) (€635,000 or $740,000).\n\n[2] MIT Department of Mathematics: The current faculty of around 50 members includes Wolf Prize winner Michael Artin, Abel Prize winner Isadore Singer, and numerical analyst Gilbert Strang.\n\n[3] Abel Prize: After interest in the concept of the prize had risen in 2001, a working group was formed to develop a proposal, which was presented to the Prime Minister of Norway in May. In August 2001, the Norwegian government announced that the prize would be awarded beginning in 2002, the two-hundredth anniversary of Abel's birth. Atle Selberg received an honorary Abel Prize in 2002, but the first actual Abel Prize was awarded in 2003.\n\n[4] Abel Prize: The prize was first proposed in 1899, to be part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Niels Henrik Abel's birth in 1902. Shortly before his death in 1899, the Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie proposed establishing an Abel Prize when he learned that Alfred Nobel's plans for annual prizes would not include a prize in mathematics. King Oscar II was willing to finance a mathematics prize in 1902, and the mathematicians Ludwig Sylow and Carl Størmer drew up statutes and rules for the proposed prize. However, Lie's influence waned after his death, and the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway in 1905 ended the first attempt to create an Abel Prize.\n\n[5] Eötvös Loránd University: Eötvös Loránd University (, ELTE) is a Hungarian public research university based in Budapest. Founded in 1635, ELTE is one of the largest and most prestigious public higher education institutions in Hungary. The 28,000 students at ELTE are organized into eight faculties, and into research institutes located throughout Budapest and on the scenic banks of the Danube. ELTE is affiliated with 5 Nobel laureates, as well as winners of the Wolf Prize, Fulkerson Prize and Abel Prize, the latest of which was Abel Prize winner Endre Szemerédi in 2012.\n\n[6] Abel Prize: Anyone may submit a nomination for the Abel Prize, however, self-nominations are not permitted. The nominee must be alive; however, if the awardee dies after being declared as the winner, the prize will be awarded posthumously.\n\n[7] Abel Prize: The Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters declares the winner of the Abel Prize each March after recommendation by the Abel Committee, which consists of five leading mathematicians. Both Norwegians and non-Norwegians may serve on the Committee. They are elected by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and nominated by the International Mathematical Union and the European Mathematical Society. The committee is of 2018 chaired by Norwegian mathematician Hans Munthe-Kaas (University of Bergen), and was before that, headed by Professor John Rognes.\n\n[8] Hans Munthe-Kaas: Munthe-Kaas received Exxon Mobil Award for best PhD at NTNU, 1989, and the Carl-Erik Frōberg Prize in Numerical Mathematics 1996 for the paper \"Lie–Butcher theory for Runge–Kutta Methods\". Munthe-Kaas is elected member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and the Norwegian Academy of Technological Sciences. Munthe-Kaas is the chair of the international Abel prize committee (2018-2022), he is President of the Scientific Council of Centre International de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées (CIMPA) (2017–present) and he is Editor-in-Chief of Journal Foundations of Computational Mathematics (2017–present). Munthe-Kaas was secretary of Foundations of Computational Mathematics (2005–2011) and member of the Board of the Abel Prize in Mathematics (2010–2018).\n\n[9] Science and technology in Hungary: Among Hungary's numerous research universities, the Eötvös Loránd University, founded in 1635, is one of the largest and the most prestigious public higher education institutions in Hungary.

One bright note that came from 1989, however, when Gerald Riggs set the Redskins’ all-time single-game rushing record with a performance in a 42–37 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The Redskins returned to the playoffs in 1990 as a Wild Card team, but lost in the Divisional playoffs to the 49ers, 28–10.\n\n[2] 1970 Washington Redskins season: It was the 25th consecutive season that the Redskins did not advance to the playoffs. Austin's contract was not renewed, and he was succeeded by George Allen in January 1971. Austin returned to Redskins in 1973 as the offensive line coach under Allen for five seasons.\n\n[3] 1976 Washington Redskins season: The 1976 Washington Redskins season was the franchise’s 45th overall and 40th in Washington, D.C. The season began with the team trying to improve on their 8–6 record from 1975, which they did, finishing 10-4, second in the NFC East behind the Dallas Cowboys. They would be eliminated from the NFL playoffs by the Minnesota Vikings. This was the first season as a Redskin for Hall of Fame running back John Riggins, signed as a free agent after spending the first five seasons of his career with the New York Jets. This was also the last season in which the Redskins would make the playoffs under Hall of Fame head coach George Allen.\n\n[4] Washington Redskins: The Washington Redskins looked to return to the playoffs in 2008 but did not succeed, finishing 8–8. After Joe Gibbs announced his retirement, Jim Zorn was hired as head coach, and brought in a West Coast Offense.\n\n[5] History of the Washington Redskins: When the 1975 season was over, the Redskins had an 8–6 record and did not make the playoffs for the first time since Allen’s tenure began. The highlight of the year came during the season finale on December 21, 1975, against the Philadelphia Eagles, when Charley Taylor became the NFL’s all-time receptions leader with his 634th career catch. The 1976 season started with the Redskins going 6–4, but won the final four games to finish at 10–4 and earned a playoff berth for the fifth time in six years under George Allen. However, on December 18, 1976, the Vikings beat the Redskins in the Divisional playoffs, 35–20.\n\n[6] Jeff Bostic: Washington returned to the playoffs in the 1990 season (1990–91 NFL playoffs). With an offensive line composed of Bostic, Raleigh McKenzie (replacing the injured Russ Grimm again) and Mark Schlereth at guards, Jim Lachey and Joe Jacoby at tackles, the Redskins beat the Philadelphia Eagles in a wild card game, with 93 rushing yards, but could not get by Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round, gaining only 80 rushing yards, as the Redskins had to pass to try to catch up to the 49ers' potent offense. In the 1991 regular season, with Bostic starting all 16 games, Washington finished with a record of 14-2, leading the NFL with 485 points (30.3 points/game). In the 1991–92 NFL playoffs, with the same offensive line as the previous year, Washington beat successively the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions, and Buffalo Bills with 162, 117, and 125 rushing yards, respectively, triumphant in Super Bowl XXVI, Bostic's last playoff game. The following year, Bostic, due to an injury, played in only 4 of 16 regular season games and was replaced by Raleigh McKenzie in the 1992–93 NFL playoffs, the Redskins beating the Minnesota Vikings with 196 rushing yards, but losing, as they did in 1990, to the San Francisco 49ers. In 1993, his last, Bostic played in only 10 games and the Redskins finished with an ugly 4-12 mark. He was replaced as the\n\n[7] History of the Washington Redskins: The Redskins then fell into a slump, including three straight losses in November, which lessened the chances of the team making the playoffs. However, five consecutive victories at the end of the season allowed Washington to finish the season at 10–6, qualifying for the playoffs as a wild card team. They opened the playoffs on the road against the NFC South champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Saturday, January 7, 2006. They won the rematch by a final score of 17–10, after taking an early 14–0 lead, which they later seemed to have squandered until replay evidence showed that an apparent touchdown that would have tied the game was in fact an incomplete pass. In that game, the Redskins broke the record for fewest offensive yards (120) gained in a playoff victory, with one of their two touchdowns being from a defensive run after a fumble recovery. The following weekend, they played the Seattle Seahawks, who had received a first-round bye. The Seahawks defeated the Redskins 20–10, ending the Redskins’ hopes of reaching their first NFC Championship Game since 1991.\n\n[8] 1992 Washington Redskins season: The Redskins finished with a record of nine wins and seven losses, but still made the 1992–93 NFL playoffs. Nonetheless, a lean period for the Redskins was to follow; they were not to make the postseason again until the 1999 season and have since never seriously contended for another Super Bowl despite five more playoff appearances.\n\n[9] 2016 Washington Redskins season: After a loss in the final week to the New York Giants, the Redskins were eliminated from playoff contention. Despite missing the playoffs, the Redskins finished the season with a record of 8-7-1, which was the first consecutive winning seasons for the team since the 1996 and 1997 seasons. Along with the Philadelphia Eagles, Washington was the only team in 2016 that played seven regular-season games against teams that would reach the playoffs: four games combined against Dallas and the New York Giants, games against Green Bay and Detroit (as the NFC North was the only division besides the NFC East to send more than one team to the 2016 postseason) and a game against the sole AFC North 2016 playoff team (Pittsburgh); the Redskins' 2-5 record in these contests was a major reason they did not return to the playoffs.\n\n[10] Washington Redskins: They finished the year with a 5–11 record, which resulted in them being last in the NFC East, and the only team in the division to fail to make the playoffs. This marked the second losing season of Joe Gibbs' second term as head coach with the Redskins, compared to the one losing season he had in his first 12-year tenure as head coach. Despite the failures of the 2006 season, including free agent disasters Adam Archuleta and Brandon Lloyd, the year did see improvement in running back Ladell Betts and Campbell as quarterback.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich U.S state consumes the most turkey everyday?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Turkey as food: Turkey contains more protein per ounce than other meats. The white meat of turkey is generally considered healthier than dark meat because of its lower saturated fat content, but the nutritional differences are small. Turkey is reputed to cause sleepiness, but holiday dinners are commonly large meals served with carbohydrates, fats, and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere, all of which are bigger contributors to post-meal sleepiness than the tryptophan in turkey. After World War II, cheap imported turkey tail became popular in Samoa. Because the cut is so fatty, it has been attributed to the rise in obesity rates in the Pacific. To combat obesity, turkey tails were banned from 2007 to 2013, only allowed back in Samoa to appease the demands of the World Trade Organization. For Thanksgiving in the United States, turkey is typically served stuffed or with dressing (on the side), with cranberry sauce and gravy. Common complementary dishes include mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, green beans, squash, and sweet potatoes. Pie is the usual dessert, especially those made from pumpkins, apples, or pecans.\n\n[2] Olive oil: The United States is not a member of the IOC and is not subject to its authority, but on October 25, 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading standards that closely parallel those of the IOC, with some adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in the U.S. Additionally, U.S. Customs regulations on \"country of origin\" state that if a non-origin nation is shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as not to mislead the consumer. Yet most major U.S. brands continue to put \"imported from Italy\" on the front label in large letters and other origins on the back in very small print. \"In fact, olive oil labeled 'Italian' often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece.\" This makes it unclear what percentage of the olive oil is really of Italian origin.\n\n[3] Turkey ham: Around January 1980, the American Meat Institute (AMI) attempted to ban the use of the term \"turkey ham\" for products that contain no ham and are entirely composed of turkey, which the AMI described as \"flagrant consumer deception\". Use of the term \"turkey ham\" for such products was also opposed by some ham producers in the United States. Circa this time, the U.S. government began requiring turkey ham producers to include the words \"cured turkey thigh meat\" on turkey ham packaging. In 2010, it was written in the \"Handbook of Poultry Science and Technology, Secondary Processing\" that the term \"cured turkey thigh meat\" always followed the words \"turkey ham\" on American turkey ham packaging.\n\n[4] Tea in Turkey: Tea is an important part of Turkish culture, and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee consumption. Offering tea to guests is part of Turkish hospitality. Tea is most often consumed in households, shops, and by \"kıraathane\" – social gatherings of men. Despite its popularity, tea only became the beverage of choice in Turkey in the 20th century. It was initially encouraged as an alternative to coffee, which had become expensive and at times unavailable in the aftermath of World War I. Upon the loss of southeastern territories after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, coffee became an expensive import. At the urging of the founder of the republic, Atatürk, Turkish people turned more to tea as it was easily sustainable by domestic sources. Turkish tea is traditionally offered in small tulip-shaped glasses which are usually held by the rim, in order to save the drinker's fingertips from being burned, as the tea is served boiling hot.\n\n[5] List of turkey meat producing companies in the United States: The dominant market for U.S. turkey meat is Mexico. It has been purchasing meat valued at nearly $372.6 million and accounting for 55 percent of turkey exports. The second largest market for U.S. turkey, purchasing more than $70.5 million of meat, is China. Canada and Hong Kong were other significant markets for U.S. turkey meat. (FAS 2012)\n\n[6] Energy policy of the United States: In 2006, the U.S. consumed of petroleum a day, of which is motor gasoline. Transportation is the largest consumer, accounting for approximately 68.9%, and 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report. With approximately 5% of the world's population, the United States is responsible for approximately 25% of annual global oil consumption and according to 2008 estimates has a per-person daily consumption rate more than double that of the European Union. Automobiles are the single largest consumer of oil, consuming 40%, and are also the source of 20% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n[7] Thanksgiving (United States): In the United States, certain kinds of food are traditionally served at Thanksgiving meals. Turkey, usually roasted and stuffed (but sometimes deep-fried instead), is typically the featured item on most Thanksgiving feast tables, so much so that Thanksgiving is also colloquially known as \"Turkey Day.\" In fact, 45 million turkeys were consumed on Thanksgiving Day alone in 2015. With 85 percent of Americans partaking in the meal, that's an estimated 276 million Americans dining on the festive poultry, spending an expected $1.05 billion on turkeys for Thanksgiving in 2016.\n\n[8] Consumer math: Consumer math comprises practical mathematical techniques used in commerce and everyday life. In the United States, consumer math is typically offered in high schools, some elementary schools, or in some colleges which grant associate's degrees.\n\n[9] Breakfast: In Turkish cuisine, a typical breakfast consists of bread, cheese (\"beyaz peynir\", \"kaşar\" etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and kaymak. \"Sucuk\" (spicy Turkish sausage), \"pastırma\", \"börek\", \"simit\", \"poğaça\" and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A common Turkish specialty for breakfast is called \"menemen\", which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, olive oil and eggs. Various soups (çorba) are also very common and traditional for Turkish breakfast; mainly chicken broth, lentil soup, and a national delicacy, \"tarhana\" soup (Turkish cereal food consisting of flour yogurt and vegetables fermented then dried; it is consumed as a soup by mixing it with stock or water) are most well known soups. Tripe soup, trotter soup, sheep's head soup are also traditionally very common all over Turkey for breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, \"kahvaltı\", means \"before coffee,\" (\"kahve\", 'coffee'; \"altı\", 'under'). but since after the First World War, during which the Ottoman Empire lost its coffee-producing territories, tea has displaced coffee as the everyday hot drink in Turkey. In Sirkeci district of Istanbul, Pide is a popular morning meal.\n\n[10] Tea: Turkish tea is an important part of that country's cuisine, and is the most commonly consumed hot drink, despite the country's long history of coffee consumption. In 2004 Turkey produced 205,500 tonnes of tea (6.4% of the world's total tea production), which made it one of the largest tea markets in the world, with 120,000 tons being consumed in Turkey, and the rest being exported. In 2010 Turkey had the highest per capita consumption in the world at 2.7 kg. As of 2013, the per-capita consumption of Turkish tea exceeds 10 cups per day and 13.8 kg per year. Tea is grown mostly in Rize Province on the Black Sea coast.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the question with a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Sugaya wrote and illustrated \"Game Center Arashi\", a manga. He Also Drew A Manga tied to the Japanese Spiderman Show from the 1970s and also drew the manga adaptations of all Kamen rider series from Ichigo to stronger.\n\n[2] Kazuya Kamenashi: Born in Edogawa, Tokyo on February 23, 1986, Kamenashi is the third child of his parents. He has two older brothers, Yūichirō and Kōji, and one younger brother, Yūya. He also has two sisters-in-law and a niece from his second brother's marriage and a nephew from his first brother's marriage. His given name comes from a character from the manga, \"Touch\", written by a Japanese manga artist, Mitsuru Adachi. Coincidentally, bandmate Tatsuya Ueda was also named after the twin brother of Kamenashi's namesake.\n\n[3] List of Saint Seiya Episode.G characters: Most of the protagonists were originally created by Masami Kurumada, who introduced them in his 1986 manga \"Saint Seiya\" as supporting characters and, at one point, antagonists. In the first volume of \"Episode.G\", author Megumu Okada has commented that his intention was to write a prequel to the original story and critics have noted that he has done a good job in making the characters his own while staying true to their original concept. Okada adopted the colour schemes of either the original manga or its anime adaptation and used the same fighting techniques and mottoes that identified each character in Kurumada's manga. The story has many dialogues and situations that refer to the original manga. At the same time, Okada adds to their back-stories and renovates designs according to his personal drawing style. Characters appear more stylised, \"anorexic and androgynous\" in the words of Manga-News's critic, and are drawn with enhanced details, especially on clothing and armours. Entire scenes have been taken directly from Kurumada's work and replicated in \"Episode.G\", with the only change being the drawing style.\n\n[4] List of Rurouni Kenshin characters: Nobuhiro Watsuki created Megumi as a \"mature woman,\" but had no specific model in mind. In the first \"Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story\" one-shot, Megumi, Kaoru and Yahiko were siblings. Despite this version and her final version in the main series being so different, Watsuki said that they have the same spirit and therefore are not so unalike. Although he admitted the one-shot's version of Megumi had a \"lighter quality\" because of her small role, so he therefore gave her a more \"earthy quality\" in the main serial so she could make an impression. By the time of the publication of \"Rurouni Kenshin\" volume four, Watsuki felt some disappointment as she did not turn out nearly the way he wanted. However, because she is entertaining to draw and is the only other woman whom Kaoru can interact with, he planned to have Megumi appear frequently as a secondary character. Watsuki's used the young grandmother from Takeshi Obata's \"Cyborg Jii-chan G\" as the design model for Megumi. Her story arc has \"redemption for her crimes\" as its theme, and the author wanted to express Kenshin's determination through Megumi. Megumi came in fourteenth place in the series' second character popularity poll, and fifteenth in the third. She is portrayed by Yū Aoi in the live-action films.\n\n[5] Masami Kurumada: He also has authorized two manga authors to write and draw sidestories for his manga \"Saint Seiya\", specifically \"Saint Seiya Episode G\", written and drawn by Megumu Okada, and \"Saint Seiya Lost Canvas\", written and drawn by Shiori Teshirogi. Since these two works aren't authored by Kurumada, but only authorized and supervised by him, the events depicted in them and the characters created for them are still considered non-canonical, unlike \"Next Dimension\" which holds an official canonical status.\n\n[6] List of Fruits Basket characters: , aged 21–22, is the Monkey of the Chinese zodiac. He is depicted as a beautiful but unstable young man with very low self-esteem and a tendency to overreact. He apologizes frantically for everything, even things that are not his fault. In this, he takes after his mother, the hostess of the Sohma family's onsen, whose position he is in training to take over. Ritsu dresses in women's clothing because he says he then feels less pressure from society, and is initially mistaken for a woman by Tohru Honda because of his long hair and beauty. Most Sohmas call him \"Rit-chan\" and, to Shigure's amusement, Tohru calls him \"Rit-chan-san\" (see \"Japanese honorifics\"). Shigure likes to play with Ritsu's insecurities and gullibility, much as he does his editor, Mitsuru; when Ritsu and Mitsuru meet, they realize they have this in common., and in a bonus story in the first fan-book, he and Mitsuru are a couple. In the final chapter of the manga, Ritsu is giving Kagura one of his women's kimonos, has cut his hair short, and is not dressed like a girl. Natsuki Takaya derived his name from the eighth month, \"odakaritsuki\" or \"rice harvest month,\" which is the month of the Monkey, of the traditional Japanese calendar. In an author's note, Takaya said that she \n\n[7] Persona 3: Several figurines of the characters have been produced by Kotobukiya, a Japanese collectible toy company. They include the Protagonist of the game, Aigis, Mitsuru, and Akihiko. The figurines have interchangeable parts, such as an Evoker or weapon, which can be stored in the base. Alter, another Japanese company that specializes in collectibles, has also released 1:8 scale figurines of Elizabeth, Aigis, and Mitsuru. The headphones worn by the Protagonist are sold by Audio-Technica, model ATH-EM700(Japan-only version). Atlus collaborated with the Japanese publishing company Enterbrain to publish the game's multiple strategy guides and an artbook detailing character and setting designs.\n\n[8] List of Battle Royale characters: In the novel and manga, Boy #17 is Kiriyama's loyal second-in-command in the street gang. He was an aggressive classmate who had bullied a number of other students during flashbacks such as Yoshio Akamatsu. After Kiriyama passes a note and tells the gang to meet him at the \"southernmost end of this rock\" which is the reef on a battle royale map. Mitsuru happens to stumble upon the dead bodies of his fellow gang members (along with Izumi, an innocent bystander). He is betrayed by Kazuo, who tells Mitsuru he has decided upon a coin flip to play the programme. Mitsuru opens fire, Kazuo dodges easily and unloads many of his own rounds, most of them hitting Mitsuru in the face. He dies almost instantly.\n\n[9] Concerto (manga): , is a Japanese manga by Mitsuru Hattori. It was published by Hakusensha and was serialized in \"Young Animal Zōkan Island\" magazine between 2005 and 2011. The manga consists of five chapters in one volume.\n\n[10] List of Saint Seiya Episode.G characters: This character was first created by Masami Kurumada. Megumu Okada stays true to that design's colour scheme, making Aldebaran a blond.

Erotic thriller \"Color of Night\" became the only Golden Raspberry Worst Picture \"winner\" to not receive a single other Razzie (out of eight other nominations). \"Thumbelina\" became the first animated film to be nominated for and win a Razzie, which it received for Worst Original Song. \"The Specialist\", \"Wyatt Earp\", \"The Flintstones\" and \"\" each took home two awards, even though the latter two weren't nominated for Worst Picture. The list of nominees follows, with recipients denoted in bold.\n\n[2] 24th Golden Raspberry Awards: Late summer box office bomb \"Gigli\" led the pack, receiving nine nominations and becoming the first film to sweep the six major categories (Worst Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay, and Screen Couple). Tied for second most-nominated, with eight each, were the Mike Myers holiday film \"The Cat in the Hat\" and \"From Justin to Kelly\", a remake of \"Where the Boys Are\" inspired by the television series \"American Idol\". As with Bill Cosby on the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards and Tom Selleck on the 13th Golden Raspberry Awards, respectively, Ben Affleck did not attend the ceremony, he later not giving the Worst Actor trophy on the radio, and buy/accept the award on \"Larry King Live\" and the Razzie trophy used to rent the Ivar Theater for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards the next year.\n\n[3] Battlefield Earth (novel): The film opened to nearly universal negative reviews and was a large box office bomb. Due to bad word of mouth and Internet buzz, it quickly disappeared from theatre chains, having grossed $29,725,663 worldwide against a reported $73 million budget. Almost all aspects of the film were criticized: hammy acting (especially by Travolta and Pepper), the film's overuse of Dutch angles, mediocre visual effects, corny dialogue, and several plot inconsistencies. The film received seven Golden Raspberry Awards at the 21st such ceremony, including that for Worst Picture, and it later won two special awards: \"Worst Drama of Our [the Razzies'] First 25 Years\" and \"Worst Picture of the Decade\" (2000‒2009), at the 25th and 30th Golden Raspberry Awards respectively. Only \"Jack and Jill\", a 2011 comedy co-written, produced by, and starring Adam Sandler, has won more Raspberries (jointly or solely winning all ten of the awards presented at the 32nd Razzies).\n\n[4] 29th Golden Raspberry Awards: The 29th Golden Raspberry Awards, or Razzies, ceremony was held by the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation to honor the worst films the film industry had to offer in 2008. The ceremony was held at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Hollywood, California on February 21, 2009.

Award results were based on votes from approximately 650 journalists, cinema fans and film professionals from 20 countries. Awards were presented by John Wilson, the ceremony's founder. \"The Love Guru\" received the most awards, winning Worst Picture, Worst Actor, and Worst Screenplay. Paris Hilton received three awards, including Worst Actress for her work in \"The Hottie & the Nottie\" and Worst Supporting Actress for \"Repo! The Genetic Opera\". Hilton matched the record number of awards received by an actor in a single year, set by Eddie Murphy the previous year at the 28th Golden Raspberry Awards for his roles in \"Norbit\".\n\n[5] 36th Golden Raspberry Awards: \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" received the most awards, winning Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Actress, Worst Screen Combo and Worst Screenplay. \"Fantastic Four\" tied for Worst Picture, also receiving Worst Director and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel. Eddie Redmayne received Worst Supporting Actor for \"Jupiter Ascending\", while Kaley Cuoco received Worst Supporting Actress for \"\" and \"The Wedding Ringer\". The Razzie Redeemer Award, given to former Razzie winners and nominees for quality work in film, was given to Sylvester Stallone for his Oscar-nominated role in \"Creed\" after receiving seven Razzie awards in the past. The winners were announced via parody sketches; one of them was performed by an impersonation of Donald Trump, who won Worst Supporting Actor at the 11th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1990. None of the winners or nominees attended the ceremony. Per tradition, the nominations announcement and the ceremony took place one day before their corresponding 88th Academy Awards ceremony. The Razzie Redeemer Award winner was decided through a public vote on Rotten Tomatoes, while the 943 members of the Golden Raspberry Foundation voted to determine the winners for the other categories. Membership is open to the public for a membership fee.\n\n[6] Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel: The Razzie Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel is an award presented at the annual Golden Raspberry Awards for the worst prequel, remake, rip-off, or sequel of the previous year, whether the remake was deliberate, a parody, or simply a film with a coincidental plot resembling some previous work. The following is a list of nominees and recipients of that award, including each film's distribution company. From 1994 to 2005, the category was titled Worst Remake or Sequel. The category was divided into Worst Prequel or Sequel and Worst Remake or Rip-off in 2006 and 2007. The categories were again merged in 2008. The award was not presented in 1996 and 1999.\n\n[7] Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo: The Razzie Award for Worst Screen Combo is an award presented at the annual Golden Raspberry Awards to the worst movie pairing or cast of the past year.

For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Lake Sherwood as a census-designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name.\n\n[3] Lake Sherwood, California: According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 3.3 square miles (8.6 km2), 3.1 square miles (8.1 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2) of it (5.65%) is water.\n\n[4] Sherwood Country Club: Lake Sherwood, originally Potrero Lake, is the oldest man-made lake in California. It was built in 1904 and is approximately . It was changed to Lake Sherwood when the surrounding areas, used for the filming of \"Robin Hood\" starring Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., in 1921, became known as \"Sherwood Forest\" and \"Maid Marian Park.\"\n\n[5] Sherwood, Tennessee: The Crow Creek Valley, in which Sherwood is situated, is a relatively narrow valley surrounded on three sides (north, east, and west) by the Cumberland Plateau (including Lost Cove), with the southern end of the valley opening toward Alabama. Crow Creek, which flows from Lost Cove Cave, drains the valley and flows through the western part of Sherwood, emptying into the Tennessee River at Guntersville Lake near Stevenson, Alabama, several miles to the south. Sherwood lies at an elevation of .\n\n[6] Sherwood Park Freeway: In the early 1900s, Wye Road followed the alignment of present-day 76 Avenue out of Edmonton to the east, enroute to North Cooking Lake. By the 1920s it had become a secondary unsurfaced thoroughfare, and was later named Highway 14. As Edmonton and the newly developed Sherwood Park grew in the late 1960s, a free-flowing road, Sherwood Park Freeway, was built to link the two on a new alignment of Highway 14 several hundred meters north of Wye Road. The cloverleaf interchange at the freeway's east end was completed in 1965, and the remaining interchanges were completed in 1968. It was four lanes wide and included an additional interchange immediately east of 17 Street that has since been removed. After completion of Sherwood Park Freeway, the existing Highway 14 (76 Avenue) was renamed to Highway 14A. Further south, Whitemud Drive was constructed and eventually extended east to reach Highway 14. It then assumed the designation of Highway 14 to a new terminus at Calgary Trail. The Highway 14A designation has since been removed from 76 Avenue, and the portion of Sherwood Park Freeway within Strathcona County was eventually renumbered Highway 100.\n\n[7] Lake Sherwood (West Virginia): Lake Sherwood (locally called \"Sherwood Lake\") is a reservoir located within the Lake Sherwood Recreation Area of the Monongahela National Forest in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, USA. The recreation area surrounding Lake Sherwood contains camping and picnicking facilities as well as a non-fossil fuel boating site and a beach for swimmers. It also includes several easy hikes, some with attractive lake views. The lake is located near community of Neola and covers most of the farmland of Richard Rider and Jane Dixon Rider who settled the land around 1790.\n\n[8] Sherwood Creek: Sherwood Creek varies widely in its geography, for example, one minute its one inch deep rock bottom, and the next, its three feet deep sand bottom. The creek is fed by Mason Lake, which in turn is fed by another creek. The creek, in places, is rock bottom; the rocks are generally smooth and dark in color. In other places of the creek, it is sand bottom, in these areas it is usually deep. Sherwood Creek has one known tributary.\n\n[9] Sherwood College: The school is on a large, sprawling campus on the Ayarpata hill (one among the seven hills that boundary Nainital Lake). The school is divided into two parts: Dixon Wing (grades 7-12) and Horsman Wing (grades 3-6). There are separate dormitories for the students of both wings. The girls' dormitories are with the new teachers' residences, a little away from the main campus.\n\n[10] Lake Sherwood, California: Lake Sherwood has approximately 660 residences and consists of a guard-gated golf-club community, 3 electronic-gated communities, and lake-view homes along Lake Sherwood Drive. The area is almost completely residential, most residents using neighboring Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, or Agoura Hills for commercial needs.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [3].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question \"How large is Lake Sherwood?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.

In 2007, the first genome sequencing of a \"P. acnes\" bacteriophage (PA6) was reported. The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic therapy such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne. Probiotics have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin's ceramide content. As of 2014, studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited.\n\n[2] Clearasil: Clearasil is an American brand of skin care and acne medication, whose products contain chiefly benzoyl peroxide, sulfur & resorcinol, triclosan, or salicylic acid as active ingredients. Clearasil has a wide range of products both for rapid and sometimes slow acne treatment and for everyday prevention. The products are marketed to customers worldwide. Clearasil was invented in the United States in 1950 by Ivan Combe with the help of chemist Kedzie Teller. At this time, it was the first dermatological brand created specially for younger skin to fight against pimples (acne). The active ingredients in the original product were sulfur and resorcinol, similar to the pre-existing adult acne product Acnomel. Combe used the popular ABC television show \"American Bandstand\" to help promote the product and its superior smell. In 1975, Wolfman Jack signed a contract promoting the product Clearasil Acne Ointment. In 1960 the brand was bought by Richardson-Vicks. In 1985 Richardson-Vicks was acquired by Procter & Gamble together with Clearasil. In 2000 Clearasil moved to the Boots Group portfolio. In 2006 Boots Healthcare International was purchased by Reckitt Benckiser.\n\n[3] Acne: Clascoterone is a topical antiandrogen which has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of acne in both males and females and is currently in the late stages of clinical development. It has shown no systemic absorption or associated antiandrogenic side effects. In a direct head-to-head comparison, clascoterone showed greater effectiveness than topical isotretinoin. 5α-Reductase inhibitors like finasteride and dutasteride might be useful for the treatment of acne in both males and females, but have been evaluated very little for this purpose. In addition, the high risk of birth defects with 5α-reductase inhibitors limits their use in women. However, 5α-reductase inhibitors can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy, and are frequently used to treat excessive hair in women. There is no evidence as of 2010 to support the use of cimetidine or ketoconazole in the treatment of acne.\n\n[4] Benzoyl peroxide: Benzoyl peroxide is effective for reducing the number and severity of acne lesions. It has a bactericidal effect on \"Propionibacterium acnes\" bacteria associated with acne and does not induce antibiotic resistance. It may be combined with salicylic acid, sulfur, erythromycin or clindamycin (antibiotics), or adapalene (a synthetic retinoid). Two common combination drugs include benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and adapalene/benzoyl peroxide, an unusual formulation considering most retinoids are deactivated by peroxides. Combination products such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/salicylic acid appear to be slightly more effective than benzoyl peroxide alone for the treatment of acne lesions.\n\n[5] Acne: Topical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.\n\n[6] Acne: Azelaic acid has been shown to be effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide 5%, isotretinoin 0.05%, and erythromycin 2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.\n\n[7] Acne: Complementary therapies have been investigated for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against \"P. acnes,\" and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.\n\n[8] Azelaic acid: Azelaic acid is used to treat mild to moderate acne, both comedonal acne and inflammatory acne. It belongs to a class of medication called dicarboxylic acids. It works by killing acne bacteria that infect skin pores. It also decreases the production of keratin, which is a natural substance that promotes the growth of acne bacteria. Azelaic acid is also used as a topical gel treatment for rosacea, due to its ability to reduce inflammation. It clears the bumps and swelling caused by rosacea. The mechanism of action is thought to be through the inhibition of hyperactive protease activity that converts cathelicidin into the antimicrobial skin peptide LL-37. Azelaic acid has been used for treatment of skin pigmentation including melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, particularly in those with darker skin types. It has been recommended as an alternative to hydroquinone. As a tyrosinase inhibitor, azelaic acid reduces synthesis of melanin.\n\n[9] Benzoyl peroxide: Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a medication and industrial chemical. As a medication, it is used to treat mild to moderate acne. For more severe cases, it may be used with other treatments. Some versions are sold mixed with antibiotics such as clindamycin. Other uses include bleaching flour, hair bleaching, teeth whitening, and textile bleaching. It is also used in the plastic industry. Common side effects are skin irritation, dryness, or peeling. Use in pregnancy is of unclear safety. Benzoyl peroxide is in the peroxide family of chemicals. When used for acne, it works by killing bacteria. Benzoyl peroxide was first made in 1905 and came into medical use in the 1930s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Benzoyl peroxide is available as a generic medication and over the counter. In the United Kingdom, 150 ml of a 10% solution cost the NHS about £4. In the United States, a month of treatment costs less than 25.\n\n[10] Acne: Antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone have been used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combined birth control pills, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The medication is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and is thought to be a useful acne treatment due to its ability to additionally block the androgen receptor at higher doses. Alone or in combination with a birth control pill, spironolactone has shown a 33 to 85% reduction in acne lesions in women. The effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dose-dependent. High-dose cyproterone acetate alone has been found to decrease symptoms of acne in women by 75 to 90% within 3 months. It is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency. The medication has also been found to be effective in the treatment of acne in males, with one study finding that a high dosage reduced inflammatory acne lesions by 73%. However, the side effects of cyproterone acetate in males, such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and decreased bone mineral density, make its use for acne in this sex impractical in most cases. Hormonal therapies should not be used to\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nIs certyl alcohol safe for acne?\n\n(Note: I apologize for the typo in the question.

However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the \"Barnegat\"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.\n\n[2] Casco-class cutter: Between 1941 and 1946, the United States Navy acquired 35 \"Barnegat\"-class small seaplane tenders, designated \"AVP\" in the Navys alphanumeric hull numbering system and designed to logistically and administratively support a squadron of flying boats operating from undeveloped areas and, with a substantial anti-air, antisurface, and antisubmarine capability, to escort larger seaplane tenders. Most of them served during World War II, although even during the war the Navy determined the number of \"Barnegat\"s to be surplus to requirements; as a result, one was completed as a catapult training ship for Navy floatplane pilots (retaining its \"AVP\" designation) and four were converted during construction into motor torpedo boat tenders, redesignated \"AGP\".\n\n[3] USS Hatteras (AVP-42): \"Hatteras\" was to have been one of 41 \"Barnegat\"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the \"Barnegat\"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.\n\n[4] Barnegat-class seaplane tender: Before World War II, the United States Navy foresaw a need for a large force of seaplane tenders in the event of a war in the Pacific, to allow air operations from undeveloped islands and atolls. Full-size seaplane tenders (AVs) were designed to support two squadrons of flying boats each, but they were more expensive to build and had a deep draft, precluding their use in shallow harbors. The U.S. Navy therefore also planned for \"small seaplane tenders\" (AVPs), with a shallower draft, capable of supporting only one squadron each, but cheaper to build and able to operate in shallow waters. The AVPs were not the descendants of the \"seaplane tenders (destroyer)\" (AVDs), which were converted from old destroyers because the Barnegat class could not be built quickly enough to meet the needs of the Navy at the start of the war. Both the full-size and small seaplane tenders were designed to provide supplies, spare parts, fuel, repairs, and berthing for assigned seaplane squadrons, and were well-armed so that they could serve as the primary line of defense of the seaplane bases they set up.\n\n[5] USS Matanzas (AVP-46): \"Matanzas\" was to have been one of 41 \"Barnegat\"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the \"Barnegat\"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.\n\n[6] USS Barnegat (AVP-10): For the next three months, \"Barnegat\" remained at Puget Sound, conducting sea trials and testing equipment, such as her large aircraft handling crane. The “years of operation of patrol planes in the Fleet and the increasingly important role played by these planes” had also shown that the \"Lapwing\"-class converted minesweepers fell “far short of the characteristics needed” for mobile tenders to operate patrol planes “where shore facilities were not available.” This meant specifications that included a draft that would “permit entrance into the greater number of small harbors which might be suitable for seaplane anchorages,” the ability to tend a 12-plane patrol squadron, high maneuverability, and the ability to contribute to her own defense.\n\n[7] Barnegat-class seaplane tender: The \"Barnegat\" class was a large class of United States Navy small seaplane tenders (AVP) built during World War II. Thirty were completed as seaplane tenders, four as motor torpedo boat tenders, and one as a catapult training ship.\n\n[8] USS Hempstead (AVP-43): \"Hempstead\" was to have been one of 41 \"Barnegat\"-class small seaplane tenders the U.S. Navy planned to commission during the early 1940s, and was to have been built at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. However, by the spring of 1943 the Navy deemed that number of seaplane tenders excess to requirements, and decided to complete four of them as motor torpedo boat tenders and one as a catapult training ship. In addition, the Navy also decided to cancel six of the \"Barnegat\"-class ships prior to their construction, freeing up the diesel engines that would have powered them for use in escort vessels and amphibious landing craft.\n\n[9] Barnegat-class seaplane tender: The \"Barnegat\"-class ships were the first purpose-built AVPs, prior ships carrying that designation having been minesweepers. In addition to carrying out the above-described responsibilities, they were well-enough armed to be employed as escorts for larger seaplane tenders, having a substantial anti-air and anti-surface gunnery capability, as well as depth charge racks and sonar for antisubmarine work. The gun battery varied greatly, being envisioned originally as two 5-inch (127-millimeter) 38-caliber guns, being expanded to an assigned total of four such guns in 1942. Few ships mounted four of these guns, and batteries of three, two, or one 5-inch guns were mounted during World War II, accompanied by various combinations of 40-millimeter and 20 mm antiaircraft guns. The armament was reduced after the war; those ships in commission as survey ships were entirely unarmed by 1959.\n\n[10] Barnegat-class seaplane tender: In the spring of 1943, the U.S. Navy concluded that the number of \"Barnegat\"s ordered was excess to requirements. Four of them were converted during construction to motor torpedo boat tenders, while a fifth was modified during construction for use as a catapult training ship for battleship and cruiser floatplane pilots, her catapult equipment coming from that manufactured for canceled \"Cleveland\"-class light cruisers. Six other \"Barnegat\"s were canceled—four on 22 April 1943 and two more on 29 April 1943 – without having been laid down, their diesel engines being needed for various escort ships and amphibious landing craft.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The most popular new Frito-Lay product launched during this era was Doritos, which initially was positioned as a more flavorful tortilla chip. At first the chip was perceived by consumers as being too bland. In response, the company re-launched Doritos in Taco, and later Nacho Cheese, flavors. The spicier composition proved successful, and Doritos quickly became the second most popular Frito-Lay product line, second only to Lay's potato chips.\n\n[2] Frito-Lay: In 1932, Kansas City, Kansas-born Charles Elmer Doolin (1903–1959), manager of the Highland Park Confectionery in San Antonio, Texas, purchased a corn chip recipe, a handheld potato ricer, and 19 retail accounts from a corn chip manufacturer for $100, which he borrowed from his mother. Doolin established a new corn chip business, The Frito Company, in his mother's kitchen. Doolin, with his mother and brother, produced the corn chips, named Fritos, and had a production capacity of approximately 10 pounds per day and roughly 30 cents per product. Doolin distributed the Fritos in 5¢ bags. Daily sales totaled $8 to $10 and profits averaged about $2 per day. In 1933 the production of Fritos increased from 10 pounds to nearly 100 pounds due to the development of a \"hammer\" press; by the end of the year, production lines were operating in Houston and Dallas. The Frito Company headquarters also moved to Dallas to capitalize on the city's central location and better availability of raw materials. In 1937 The Frito Company opened its Research and Development lab and introduced new products, including Fritos Peanut Butter Sandwiches and Fritos Peanuts, to supplement Fritos and Fritatos Potato chips, which had been introduced in 1935.\n\n[3] Frito-Lay: In 1931, Charlotte, North Carolina-born salesman Herman Lay (1909–1982) sold potato chips in the Southern United States out of his car. In 1932, he began a potato chip business in Nashville, Tennessee. Lay was hired as a salesman for the Barrett Food Products Company, an Atlanta, Georgia manufacturer of Gardner's Potato Chips, and eventually took over Barrett's Nashville warehouse as a distributor. Lay hired his first salesman in 1934, and three years later had 25 employees and a larger manufacturing facility where he produced popcorn and peanut butter sandwich crackers.\n\n[4] Potato chip: The first flavored chips in the United States, barbecue flavor, were being manufactured and sold by 1954. In 1958, Herr's was the first company to introduce barbecue-flavored potato chips in Pennsylvania.\n\n[5] Lay's Stax: Lay's Stax is a potato chip snack food produced by Frito-Lay and manufactured in Mexico. It was introduced in 2003 as direct competition for Procter & Gamble's Pringles (currently owned by the Kellogg Company).\n\n[6] Pennsylvania: Author Sharon Hernes Silverman calls Pennsylvania the snack food capital of the world. It leads all other states in the manufacture of pretzels and potato chips. The Sturgis Pretzel House introduced the pretzel to America, and companies like Anderson Bakery Company, Intercourse Pretzel Factory, and Snyder's of Hanover are leading manufacturers in the Commonwealth. Two of the three companies that define the U.S. potato chip industry are based in Pennsylvania: Utz Quality Foods, which started making chips in Hanover, Pennsylvania, in 1921, and Wise Foods which started making chips in Berwick in 1921 (the third, Lay's Potato Chips, is a Texas company). Other companies such as Herr's Snacks, Martin's Potato Chips, Snyder's of Berlin (not associated with Snyder's of Hanover) and Troyer Farms Potato Products are popular chip manufacturers.\n\n[7] Lay's: Lay's Classic Potato chips were cooked in hydrogenated oil until 2003. Currently, the chips are made with sunflower, corn and/or canola oil.\n\n[8] Frito-Lay: Lay expanded further in the 1950s, with the purchase of The Richmond Potato Chip Company and the Capitol Frito Corporation. By 1956, with more than 1,000 employees, plants in eight cities, and branches or warehouses in thirteen others, H.W. Lay & Company was the largest manufacturer of potato chips and snack foods in the United States.\n\n[9] Hostess Potato Chips: The introduction of corn chips to the market led to a partnership between Hostess and Frito-Lay (owned by PepsiCo) in 1987, bringing Doritos to Canada for the first time (Doritos were in Canada in the late 1970s). This move was followed by the introduction of other Frito Lay brands, including Ruffles, Tostitos and Cheetos (Lay's, Frito Lay's major US chip brand, was already being licensed for Canadian manufacture by another company). Hostess remained the major chip brand even after the arrangement. The partnership led to a merger in 1988, with the joint company known as Hostess Frito Lay. In 1992 PepsiCo acquired full ownership of the company by buying out General Foods' remaining interest.\n\n[10] Lay's WOW chips: Lay's WOW Chips were fat-free potato chips produced by Frito-Lay containing Olestra. They were first introduced in 1998, and were marketed using the Lay's, Ruffles, Doritos, and Tostitos brands. Although initially popular, charting sales of $400 million in their first year, they subsequently dropped to $200 million by 2000.

The first Korean migrants settled in Yucatán as workers in henequen plantations. Labour brokers began advertising in newspapers in the Korean port city of Incheon in 1904 for workers willing to go to Mexico to work on henequen plantations for four- or five-year contracts. A total of more than one thousand were recruited and departed from Incheon on board a British cargo ship on 4 April 1905, despite efforts by the Korean government to block their departure. Once their contracts were up, most settled in Mexico, either continuing to work on henequen plantations or moving to various cities in the country.\n\n[2] New Mexico: The settlement of Santa Fe was established at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains, around 1608. The city, along with most of the settled areas of the state, was abandoned by the Spanish for 12 years (1680–92) as a result of the successful Pueblo Revolt. After the death of the Pueblo leader Popé, Diego de Vargas restored the area to Spanish rule. While developing Santa Fe as a trade center, the returning settlers founded Albuquerque in 1706 from existing surrounding communities, naming it for the viceroy of New Spain, Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 10th Duke of Alburquerque. As a part of New Spain, the claims for the province of New Mexico passed to independent Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. The Republic of Texas claimed the portion east of the Rio Grande when it seceded from Mexico in 1836, when it incorrectly assumed the older Hispanic settlements of the upper Rio Grande were the same as the newly established Mexican settlements of Texas. Texas' only attempt to establish a presence or control in the claimed territory was the failed Texan Santa Fe Expedition. Their entire army was captured and jailed by Hispanic New Mexico militia.\n\n[3] Californio: In the 1830s the newly formed Mexican government was experiencing difficulties having gone through several revolts, wars, and internal conflicts and a seemingly never ending string of Mexican Presidents. One of the problems in Mexico was the large amount of land controlled by the Catholic Church (estimated then at about one-third of all settled property) who were continually granted property by many land owners when they died or controlled property supposedly held in trust for the Indians. This land, as it gradually accumulated, was seldom sold as it cost nothing to keep, but could be rented out to gain additional income for the Catholic Church to pay its priests, Friars, Bishops etc. and other expenses. The Catholic Church was the largest and richest land owner in Mexico and its provinces. In California the situation was even more pronounced as the Franciscan Friars held over 90% of all settled property supposedly in trust for the Mission Indians.\n\n[4] Demographics of Mexico: Arab immigration to Mexico started in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Roughly 100,000 Arabic-speakers settled in Mexico during this time period. They came mostly from Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, and Iraq and settled in significant numbers in Nayarit, Puebla, Mexico City and the Northern part of the country (mainly in the states of Baja California, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, and Durango, as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara. The term \"Arab Mexican\" may include ethnic groups that do not in fact identify as Arab.\n\n[5] Spaniards in Mexico: In the 16th century, following the colonization of most of the new continents, perhaps 240,000 Spaniards entered ports in the Americas. They were joined by 450,000 in the next century. Since the conquest of Mexico, this region became the principal destination of Spanish colonial settlers in the 16th century. The first Spaniards who arrived in Mexico were soldiers and sailors from Extremadura, Andalucía and La Mancha after the conquest of the Americas. At the end of the 16th century both commoner and aristocrat from Spain were migrating to Mexico. Also, a few Canarian families colonized parts of Mexico in the 17th century (as in the case of the Azuaje families) and when the Spanish crown encouraged Canarian colonization of the Americas through the \"Tributo de sangre\" (Blood Tribute) in the 18th century, many of them settled in Yucatán, where by the 18th century they controlled the trade network that distributed goods throughout the peninsula; their descendants are still counted among the most influential families of direct Spanish descent in Mexico. During the 20th century, another group of Canarians settled in Mexico in the early 1930s, and as with Galician and other Spanish immigrants of the time, there were high rates of illiteracy and impoverishment among them, but they adapted relatively quickly.\n\n[6] History of Mexican Americans: Beginning in the 1820s, immigrants from the U.S. and Europe settled in Texas (Tejas), then part of Mexico. Anglo and Hispanic Texas joined to fight Mexico in 1836, defeating an invading army and declaring the independence of Texas. The Texas Republic included Tejanos as leading citizens, but Mexico refused to recognize its legal existence. The US annexed Texas in 1845, leading to the Mexican–American War of 1846–48. While there were some Americans who considered the war with Mexico illegal and immoral, others considered it part of Manifest Destiny—the American destiny to pursue the war. This policy claimed that it was the United States' right to expand westward across North America and settle the land.\n\n[7] Chamizal dispute: The dispute was formally settled on 14 January 1964, when the United States and Mexico ratified a treaty that generally followed the 1911 arbitration recommendations. The agreement awarded to Mexico of the Chamizal area and east of the adjacent Cordova Island. Although no payments were made between the two governments, the United States received compensation from a private Mexican bank for 382 structures included in the transfer. The United States also received of Cordova Island from Mexico, and the two nations agreed to share equally in the cost of rechanneling the river. In 1964, Presidents Adolfo López Mateos and Lyndon B. Johnson met at the border to end the dispute. On 17 September 1963, the U.S. Congress introduced the American–Mexican Chamizal Convention Act of 1964, which finally settled the matter. In October 1967, President Johnson met with President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz on the border and formally proclaimed the settlement.\n\n[8] History of Albuquerque, New Mexico: The settlers were driven out by the Pueblo Revolt in 1680. When they returned in 1692, they were able to re-settle the abandoned estancias. In 1706, the recently appointed governor of New Mexico, Francisco Cuervo y Valdés, officially designated the community as a royally chartered town and named it Alburquerque. The settlement remained small and dispersed throughout the 1700s, eventually coalescing into a series of plazas of which the largest was today's Old Town. Possession of the town, along with the rest of New Mexico, passed to Mexico in 1821 and then to the United States in 1846. These developments brought increased commerce and Albuquerque prospered as a trading hub and U.S. Army post.\n\n[9] De León's Colony: After Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, colonization possibilities looked more favorable. On April 13, 1824, prior to the 1824 Constitution of Mexico enactment on October 4, the provisional Mexican government approved a contract allowing De León to settle forty-one Mexican families on the lower Guadalupe and Lavaca rivers, in the vicinity of Coleto, Garcitas, Arenosa, and Zorillo (Placido) creeks. Under the contract, each settler received a town lot, plus one league (4,228 acres) of grazing land and one labor (177 acres) of arable land. It was the only colony in Texas settled predominately by Mexicans, as opposed to colonists who immigrated from outside Mexico. De León was to receive five leagues (22,140-acres) upon the settlement of the forty-one families. De León located his ranch along Garcitas Creek.\n\n[10] Senecú: The pueblo was resettled in November or December 1677 by reportedly over 100 Christian Indian families. It was once again abandoned during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 when the Piro followed the Spaniards out of New Mexico. Rather than return to New Mexico, the people of this pueblo settled in the El Paso district in a village called Senecú del Sur. Rumors have it that some Piro stayed in New Mexico, however Diego de Vargas did not find anyone inhabiting the pueblo when he passed by it in 1691 and 1692. The pueblo was not resettled after the Spanish re-conquest. The pueblo's ruins were visible to travelers throughout the 18th century, but they have not been seen since then.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was Mexico settled?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.\nI don't know.\n\nPlease select one of the options for each context.", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.

The reception building was built to the west of the tracks. Opposite the station building, on the other side of the station forecourt, there was a station restaurant. As the terminus of the line, a depot with three track was built to the north of the station. To the west of the depot there was a roundhouse with one stall. This had a Pulsometer steam pump for lifting water. Shortly before the roundhouse there was a coal shed, where coal was stored for the steam locomotives. The station had three platform tracks and another, which was intended for the carriage of freight. The freight facilities were at the southern end of the fourth track. There was a freight shed, with ramps at the side and at the front for loading freight, and a weighbridge with a capacity of 20 tonnes. Construction began on 25 August 1896 on the extension of the Isar Valley Railway to Bichl. The line to Eurasburg was opened on 1 June 1897 and it extended to Bichl to connect with the State Railway from Tutzing to Kochel on 23 May 1898. Wolfratshausen station continued to be significant for railway operations, since carriages were detached from trains coming from Munich and added to trains returning to Munich. The extension of the line to Eurasburg also led to the development of the tracks within the station area. So an additional siding was built to the west of\n\n[2] Rideau (company): In 1912 the Stephenson Company, situated on Saint-Maurice Street in old Montreal, began as a producer of emblematic jewelry for associations such as the Masons, the Knights of Columbus, and other organizations. During World Wars I and II, the company produced military insignia for the armed forces. However, in the mid 50’s the company's shares were sold to a U.S.-based company that moved Stephenson Company's headquarters to Montreal North. The company was later sold back to two Montrealers who had numerous business interests but nevertheless, Stephenson went into a steady state of decline.\n\n[3] Vancouver: The original settlement, named Gastown, grew up on clearcuts on the west edge of the Hastings Mill logging sawmill's property, where a makeshift tavern had been set up on a plank between two stumps and the proprietor, Gassy Jack, persuaded the curious millworkers to build him a tavern, on July 1, 1867. From that first enterprise, other stores and some hotels quickly appeared along the waterfront to the west. Gastown became formally laid out as a registered townsite dubbed Granville, B.I. (\"B.I\" standing for \"Burrard Inlet\"). As part of the land and political deal whereby the area of the townsite was made the railhead of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), it was renamed \"Vancouver\" and incorporated shortly thereafter as a city, in 1886. By 1887, the Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended westward to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport to the Pacific Ocean, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient / East Asia, Eastern Canada, and Europe. , Port Metro Vancouver is the third-largest port by tonnage in the Americas (recently displacing New York City), 27th in the world, the busiest and largest in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest\n\n[4] Winfield Toll Bridge: Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n\n[5] Wolford: In 1949 in Bregenz on Lake Constance (Austria), a city with a genuine textile heritage, the industrialist Reinhold Wolff from Vorarlberg (Austria) and the retail entrepreneur Walter Palmers (*1903, †1983) from Vienna founded a company called Wolff & Co. KG, focussing on the production of women's stockings made from real and artificial silk. They customized used American Cotton machines specifically for their own purposes, and for the first time processed polyamide fiber into stockings. The following year, the Wolford brand was officially registered. The brand name is an acronym of the name of the founder Reinhold Wolff and the city of Oxford. It should be internationally applicable. The international expansion began in the 1970s. In 1988, the company carried out a strategic refocusing and positioned its products in the luxury segment, which continues to today and is still being expanded. In addition to that, in April 1988, the company was transformed into a stock corporation. On February 14, 1995 Wolford went public with the so-called \"Lady Share\" in Vienna and Paris. The company made its mark over the years mainly due to its new seamless products, e.g. tights and bodysuits, as well as collaborations with designers such as Karl Lagerfeld, Emilio Pucci, Zac Posen, Kenzo, Valentino and Vivienne Westwood. Further, co-operations with photographers such as Helmut Newton and Mario Testino contributed to the brand awareness.\n\n[6] Volk's Electric Railway: At the invitation of the Council and the management of the railway a supporters association, 'The Volk's Electric Railway Association' was formed in 1995. Members of the Association provide practical and promotional help to the railway, including operation and maintenance tasks. The Association also attends various exhibitions with a large operating model of the railway as it was in the 1950s. Membership is open to all with an interest in the railway. Members receive an informative quarterly magazine, reduced rate travel on the railway and free admission to a series of interesting winter meetings held in Brighton. The Association also acts as a collector for Volk's memorabilia and ephemera, some of which can be seen at the South Downs Heritage Centre in Hassocks. The largest object now in the care of the Association is the ex Southend Car which between 1950 and 2000 carried the Volk's fleet number 9. Car 3 will become a two-year joint restoration project if the temporary restoration shed gains consent during spring 2014.\n\n[7] Wolfstein, Rhineland-Palatinate: Arising in Wolfstein about the middle of the 16th century, under the pledge-lords Schwickard von Sickingen's (1549-1562) and Georg Johannes I's (Palatinate-Veldenz, 1543-1592) influence, were a Reformed community and a Lutheran one alongside each other. The former belonged (along with Kreimbach, Rothselberg and Rutsweiler) to the parish of Zweikirchen with the chapel of ease on Wassergasse while the latter, to avoid disputes with the former, established its own chapel in Wolfstein. The clergyman's seat changed between Wolfstein, Roßbach and Eßweiler. This chapel was, on the occasion of the union of the Reformed and Lutheran faiths, sold in 1818, and the proceeds were used to build a rectory (\"Haus Adam\", 1822).\n\n[8] John Volken: John Volken was born in 1941 in Potsdam, a city that soon thereafter became part of communist East Germany. His father, a medical doctor, died near the end of the Second World War when John was only 3 years old. Due to her poor health, John's mother was forced to put John in an orphanage for a short while. At 14, he went from East Germany to West Germany as a refugee and started working during the day and going to school at night. In 1960, John Volken emigrated to Canada with very little money, but lots of enthusiasm for his new life in his new country. John started out as a farm labourer, dishwasher, and construction worker. When he became comfortable with the English language, he turned to sales. After several moves during his restless years, managing and developing various businesses, John settled in Vancouver. In 1981, he started United Furniture Warehouse and built it from one small store into one of the largest furniture retails chains in North America, with over 150 locations.\n\n[9] LRC (file format): Let's say we use blue for male, red for female and pink for Duet.

The Unicode for ᅮ is U+315C.\n\n[2] Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging: CMR examinations in children typically last 15 to 60 minutes. In order to avoid blurry images the child must remain very still during the examination. Different institutions have different protocols for pediatric CMR, but most children 7 years of age and older can cooperate sufficiently for a good quality examination. Providing an age-appropriate explanation of the procedure to the child in advance will increase the likelihood of a successful study. After proper safety screening, parents can be allowed into the MRI scanner room to help their child complete the examination. Some centers allow children to listen to music or watch movies through a specialized MRI-compatible audiovisual system to reduce anxiety and improve cooperation. However, the presence of a calm, encouraging, supportive parent generally produces better results in terms of pediatric cooperation than any distraction or entertainment strategy short of sedation. If the child cannot cooperate sufficiently, sedation with intravenous medications or general anesthesia may be necessary. In very young babies, it may be possible to perform the examination while they are in a natural sleep. New image capture techniques such as 4D flow require a shorter scan and can lead to reduced needs for sedation.\n\n[3] ᅰ: ᅰ is one of the Korean hangul. The Unicode for ᅰ is U+315E.\n\n[4] Bachelor's degree: Bachelor's degrees may take an average of five years (from four to five years) to complete depending on the course load and the program and they are awarded by colleges and universities. Medicine is from 6 to 7 years. Each college has its own curriculum and requirements with an emphasis of their choice, governed independently by each state of the republic. After finishing all the subjects the student require a final work, which means the completion of particular honors seminars, research and development or a written thesis in a particular field. Mexico's regulations established as an obligation in order to receive their license and title the fulfillment of a \"Social Service\" to the nation (usually for those who finished their studies in a public institution) as a remuneration to society in the form of social actions, the benefits, as students, were received during training. This requirement takes about six months to one year depending on the type of degree. Bachelor's degree should not be falsely related with its Spanish cognate \"Bachiller\", which designate a prerequisite for matriculate in a career or bachelor studies. The official name for a bachelor's degree in Mexico is \"Licenciado\" and such studies are referred as \"Licenciatura\".\n\n[5] Ġ: Ġ is the 7th letter of the Maltese alphabet, preceded by F and followed by G.

The Unicode for ᅱ is U+315F.\n\n[7] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[8] ᅯ: ᅯ is one of the Korean hangul. The Unicode for ᅯ is U+315D.\n\n[9] Assured clear distance ahead: Drivers need not and are not required to precisely determine the maximum safe speed from real-time mathematical calculations of sight distances and stopping distances for their particular vehicle. Motor vehicle operators of average intelligence are constantly required to utilize their kinesthetic memory in all sorts of driving tasks including every time they brake to a full stop at a stop line in a panoply of conditions. Like throwing a softball, one does not have to mathematically calculate a trajectory or firing solution in order to hit a target with repeated accuracy. During the earliest stages of learning how to drive, one develops a memory of when to start braking (how long it takes) from various speeds in order to stop at the limit line. While there may be a degree of variance of such skill in seasoned drivers, they generally do not have the discretion in engaging in a behavior such as driving a speed above which no reasonable minds might differ as to whether it is unsafe or that one could come to a stop within the full distance ahead.\n\n[10] Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology: It normally takes six years for a student to graduate from MIPT. The curriculum of the first three years consists exclusively of compulsory courses, with emphasis on mathematics, physics and English. There are no significant curriculum differences between the departments in the first three years. A typical course load during the first and second years can be over 48 hours a week, not including homework. Classes are taught five days a week, beginning at 9:00 am or 10:30 am and continuing until 5:00 pm, 6:30 pm, or 8:00 pm. Most subjects include a combination of lectures and seminars (problem-solving study sessions in smaller groups) or laboratory experiments. Lecture attendance is optional, while seminar and lab attendance affects grades. Andre Geim, a graduate and Nobel prize winner stated \"The pressure to work and to study was so intense that it was not a rare thing for people to break and leave and some of them ended up with everything from schizophrenia to depression to suicide.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [4].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know how long a mathematics degree takes?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [4].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.", "Orca-2-7b": "\nYes, answer is present.", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "I don't know"}}

According to Joran Friberg, a historian of mathematics, evidence indicates that the Pythagorean theorem \"was well-known to the mathematicians of the Old Babylonian period\" (20th to 16th centuries BC), which would have been over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born. The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of Pythagorean triples, knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system.\n\n[2] Pythagorean theorem: Around 400 BC, according to Proclus, Plato gave a method for finding Pythagorean triples that combined algebra and geometry. Around 300 BC, in Euclid's \"Elements\", the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented.\n\n[3] Pythagorean theorem: Bartel Leendert van der Waerden (1903–1996) conjectured that Pythagorean triples were discovered algebraically by the Babylonians. Written between 2000 and 1786 BC, the Middle Kingdom Egyptian \"Berlin Papyrus 6619\" includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet \"Plimpton 322\", written between 1790 and 1750 BC during the reign of Hammurabi the Great, contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples.\n\n[4] Project Mathematics!: In 1988, \"The Theorem of Pythagoras\" was the first video produced by the series and reviews the Pythagorean theorem. For all right triangles, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides ( a + b = c ). The theorem is named after Pythagoras of ancient Greece. Pythagorean triples occur when all three sides of a right triangle are integers such as a = 3, b = 4 and c = 5. A clay tablet shows that the Babylonians knew of Pythagorean triples 1200 years before Pythagoras, but nobody knows if they knew the more-general Pythagorean theorem. The Chinese proof uses four similar triangles to prove the theorem.\n\n[5] Geometry: In the 7th century BC, the Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales' Theorem. Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, which is credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem, though the statement of the theorem has a long history. Eudoxus (408–c. 355 BC) developed the method of exhaustion, which allowed the calculation of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures, as well as a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of incommensurable magnitudes, which enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances. Around 300 BC, geometry was revolutionized by Euclid, whose \"Elements\", widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time, introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the \"Elements\" were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. The \"Elements\" was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today. Archimedes (c\n\n[6] Pythagorean theorem: Pythagoras, whose dates are commonly given as 569–475 BC, used algebraic methods to construct Pythagorean triples, according to Proclus's commentary on Euclid. Proclus, however, wrote between 410 and 485 AD. According to Thomas L. Heath (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted. \"Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, [...] one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics.\"\n\n[7] Pythagorean theorem: A generalization of the Pythagorean theorem extending beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to similar figures was known by Hippocrates of Chios in the 5th century BC, and was included by Euclid in his \"Elements\":\n\n[8] Pythagoreanism: The Pythagoreans engaged with geometry as a liberal philosophy which served to establish principles and allowed theorems to be explored abstractly and mentally. Pythagorean philosophers believed that there was a close relationship between numbers and geometrical forms. Early-Pythagorean philosophers proved simple geometrical theorems, including \"the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles\". Pythagoreans also came up with three of the five regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube and the dodecahedron. The sides of a regular dodecahedron are regular pentagons, which for Pythagoreans symbolized health. They also revered the pentagram, as each diagonal divides the two others at the golden ratio. When linear geometrical figures replaced the dots, the combination of Babylonian algebra and Pythagorean arithmetic provided the basis for Greek geometric algebra. By attempting to establish a system of concrete and permanent rules, Pythagoreans helped to establish strict axiomatic procedures of solving mathematical problems.\n\n[9] Pythagoras: The Pythagorean theorem was known and used by the Babylonians and Indians centuries before Pythagoras, but it is possible that he may have been the first one to introduce it to the Greeks. Some historians of mathematics have even suggested that he—or his students—may have constructed the first proof. Burkert rejects this suggestion as implausible, noting that Pythagoras was never credited with having proved any theorem in antiquity. Furthermore, the manner in which the Babylonians employed Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) cuneiform sources. Pythagoras's biographers state that he also was the first to identify the five regular solids and that he was the first to discover the Theory of Proportions.\n\n[10] Pythagorean theorem: In India, the \"Baudhayana Sulba Sutra\", the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, and a geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle. The \"Apastamba Sulba Sutra\" (c. 600 BC) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem, using an area computation. Van der Waerden believed that \"it was certainly based on earlier traditions\". Carl Boyer states that the Pythagorean theorem in \"Śulba-sũtram\" may have been influenced by ancient Mesopotamian math, but there is no conclusive evidence in favor or opposition of this possibility. With contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the Chinese text \"Zhoubi Suanjing\" (周髀算经), (\"The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven\") gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle—in China it is called the \"Gougu theorem\" (勾股定理). During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\", together with a mention of right triangles\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1] and [3].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.\n\nThe contexts do mention Pythagoras, but they don't provide sufficient information to definitively answer when he introduced the Pythagorean theorem.

The winner was announced on the last day of the series, and an instrumental group called Egshiglent Chimee was the first-ever winner of \"Mongolia's Got Talent\" and was awarded 100 million ₮. The runners-up were another musical group with two men called Khasbat Barkhuu and Boldbaatar Myagmartseren. The two men played flute and yochin. The third-placed contestant, called Altanhuyag Otgonbayar, sang with lower pitch and had a sensation in Mongolia. The men had the most viewed video on Mongolia's Got Talent's YouTube Channel with 670,000 views and have almost 1 million views with all 3 videos combined.\n\n[3] 2018–19 Pakistan Premier League: Ashraf Sugar Mills and Pakistan Airlines withdrew from league with former withdrawing after playing first phase in Multan and latter not playing a single match due to financial issues. Baloch Nushki got relegated after failing to win a single match and ended third last in relegation zone with six points from 6 draws. On 9 January 2019, Karachi Port Trust got relegated to Federation League for the first time ever, after they lost 2–0 to Muslim and 12th placed Sui Northern Gas winning their game match 4–3 against Afghan Chaman, leaving Karachi Port Trust 5 points from safe zone with only one match to play. Khan Research Laboratories won the league on the final match day. Pakistan Airforce were sitting at the top of table with 51 points, one point ahead of Sui Southern Gas and three ahead of Khan Research Laboratories, who both had to face each other on final match day. Sui Southern Gas victory would hand them the title and for Khan Research Laboratories, they to beat the Sui Southern Gas by four goals to secure the title. Khan Research Laboratories the last game of the season, defeating title contenders Sui Southern Gas 4–0, finishing first on goal difference ahead of Pakistan Airforce. This is the smallest title winning margin in the history of Pakistan Premier League, with Khan Research Laboratories winning with a goal difference of just +1, as Pakistan Airforce had a goal difference on +27 and winners Khan Research Laboratories had +28. Player scored four goals\n\n[4] Pakistan Idol: \"Pakistan Idol\" had three judges: Bushra Ansari, Hadiqa Kiani, and Ali Azmat for first season. The judges' panel for the first season was officially unveiled on a special transmission of the Geo TV morning show \"Poora Pakistan\" on 20 November 2013. Ansari is a veteran television presenter, actress and comedian. She is a trained singer who joined the television industry by mimicking the singing styles of Noor Jehan. Although, she is mostly known for the various characters she played on television in the 80s and 90s. Kiani is one of the most renowned female pop stars in Pakistan. She received classical singing training under Ustad Faiz Ahmed Khan and Wajid Ali Nashad. She first appeared on television in a PTV show called \"Angan Angan Taray\" and later chose a solo singing career in the late-90s after singing playback for Pakistani movies like Sargam. The third judge, Azmat, is the front-man of the Pakistani sufi rock band, Junoon. In 2001, he became the first person ever to perform at the United Nations General Assembly along with an Indian band choosing to sing his song \"Dosti\" (English: \"Friendship\"), an aptly chosen title to promote the UN's mission in bringing peace to the world. In 2003, Ali performed live at the Royal Albert Hall in London, United Kingdom. His harsh critique on \"Pakistan Idol\" has led many to compare him with Simon Cowell leading to an angry backlash from the show's viewers.\n\n[5] Aatka Feroz: Aatka Feroz is Miss Pakistan World title holder as she was only 19 years old when she got crowned in 2014. She also won the Miss Talent award in the Miss Pakistan World pageant besides the main title. Feroz did not go to any international pageants to represent Pakistan. However, Shanzay Hayat was sent to the Miss Earth pageant in the year 2014 to represent Pakistan in her place.\n\n[6] Pakistan Sangeet Icon: The winner of the first competition was Asad Abbas. Then he sang for a live singing show called \"Yeh Shaam Mastani\" Executive Producer of Ali Fareed & Producer/Director \"Mujtaba Lakhiya & Safdar Ali\" where he got a lot of appreciation from audiences around the world. Asad later joined Mekaal Hasan Band in mid-2010. Shahid Mehmood has the biggest collection of Asad Abbas performances on its YouTube channel. You can also watch Pakistan Sangeet Icon Season One on the same YouTube channel, launched Pakistan Sangeet Icon Season II under the supervision of Ali Fareed.\n\n[7] Shanzay Hayat: Shanzay Hayat was the first girl who won four titles in the Miss Pakistan World pageant. She was the recipient of Miss Perfect Ten 2013, Miss Talent 2013, Miss Popularity 2013 and the main title of Miss Pakistan World 2013. She was the first ever beauty queen in the history of Miss Pakistan World pageants to receive 4 titles in the same pageant.\n\n[8] Rauf Lala: In 2006, he was invited in an Indian reality show by channel Star One, to participate with other fellow Pakistani's and Indian actors. His special episode was when Bipasha Basu was there in the final episode of \"The Great Indian Laughter Challenge\" - Season 2 which he won and where he was awarded the title \"Comedy Ka Shahenshah\". He is the first Pakistani to win that major Indian contest.\n\n[9] Miss Pakistan World: Founded in 2002 by Pakistani-Canadian entrepreneur Sonia Ahmed, and in its first year called \"Miss Canada Pakistan\", the contest is held in Canada because beauty pageants are highly controversial in Pakistan and if it were held there, security for contestants would be too problematic. According to Ahmed, \"Pakistan's slow changing movement to liberate its women forbids such events from taking place on its soil.\" The name of the pageant was changed to Miss Pakistan World, when contestants from around the world started applying for the title. It is the only pageant existing for single Pakistani women in the world. The first Miss Pakistan World to be crowned was Zehra Sheerazi on 1 February 2003 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Sheerazi went on to represent Pakistan in Pakistan's first ever debut in international pageants, World Miss University. The winners went on to represent Pakistan in international pageants as well as the contestants came from diverse backgrounds to participate.\n\n[10] Zehra Sheerazi: Zehra Sheerazi was crowned Miss Pakistan World (pageant was formerly titled Miss Canada Pakistan) on February 3, 2003. She was the first ever winner of this title and the first Pakistani girl to ever win a beauty pageant anywhere. 19 years old at the time of her crowning, Zehra Sheerazi continues to be the youngest title holder in the pageant's history. Sheerazi went on to compete in the 2003 Miss World University pageant in Korea. Sheerazi did not win the Miss World University Pageant crown but she was the sixth runner-up and given the Peace Ambassador Award. More over, it was the first time that a representative of Pakistan participated in the 16-year history of the show.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Tryon farmed land near what later became Stampher Road in Lake Oswego, built a sawmill, and constructed a house on the property. It was one of the few homes built in Clackamas County during the territorial period, 1848–59, before Oregon became a state. Described in \"Classic Houses of Portland Oregon, 1850–1950\", the house was demolished in the 1990s. Prior to its demise, it was the only house in the Portland metropolitan area that remained on its original donation land claim. Rectangular in form, it was a rural farmhouse built on a foundation of brick and stone and included \"greatly simplified\" Greek Revival details. It stood on a promontory overlooking the Willamette River. Socrates Tryon died in Oregon on May 15, 1855, and was buried in Lone Fir Cemetery in southeast Portland. He left the land to his wife, which in 1869 she gave to Socrates Tryon Jr., Sallie, and her husband, A.A. Cleveland. In 1874 they sold the to the Oregon Iron Company. Frances and Socrates Tryon Jr., were also buried at Lone Fir Cemetery.\n\n[2] Socratic problem: Aristophanes (c. 450 to 386 BC) was alive during the early years of Socrates. One source shows Plato and Xenophon were about 45 years younger than Socrates, other sources show Plato as something in the range of 42 to 43 years younger, while Xenophon is thought to be 40 years younger.\n\n[3] Socrates: Socrates lived during the time of the transition from the height of the Athenian hegemony to its decline with the defeat by Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian War. At a time when Athens sought to stabilize and recover from its defeat, the Athenian public may have been entertaining doubts about democracy as an efficient form of government. Socrates appears to have been a critic of democracy, and some scholars interpret his trial as an expression of political infighting.\n\n[4] Socrates: The character of Socrates as exhibited in \"Apology\", \"Crito\", \"Phaedo\" and \"Symposium\" concurs with other sources to an extent to which it seems possible to rely on the Platonic Socrates, as demonstrated in the dialogues, as a representation of the actual Socrates as he lived in history. At the same time, however, many scholars believe that in some works, Plato, being a literary artist, pushed his avowedly brightened-up version of \"Socrates\" far beyond anything the historical Socrates was likely to have done or said. Also, Xenophon, being an historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates. It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is whom Plato is describing at any given point—the historical figure, or Plato's fictionalization. As British philosopher Martin Cohen has put it, \"Plato, the idealist, offers an idol, a master figure, for philosophy. A Saint, a prophet of 'the Sun-God', a teacher condemned for his teachings as a heretic.\"\n\n[5] Socratic problem: Socrates — who is often credited with turning Western philosophy in a more ethical/political direction and who was put to death by the democracy of Athens in May 399 BC — was Plato's mentor. Plato, like some of his contemporaries, wrote dialogues about his teacher. Much of what is known about Socrates comes from Plato's writings; however, it is widely believed that very few, if any, of Plato's dialogues can be verbatim accounts of conversations between them or unmediated representations of Socrates' thought. Many of the dialogues seem to use Socrates as a device for Plato's thought, and inconsistencies occasionally crop up between Plato and the other accounts of Socrates; for instance, Plato has Socrates denying that he would ever accept money for teaching, while Xenophon's \"Symposium\" clearly has Socrates stating that he is paid by students to teach wisdom and that this is what he does for a living.\n\n[6] Trial of Socrates: As with many of the issues surrounding Socrates’ conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.” Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates’ contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty’s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty’s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty. Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato’s \"Apology\" has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. Socrates simply did not answer this order, nor had he Leon warned, \n\n[7] Socrates of Constantinople: The history covers the years 305 to 439, and experts believe it was finished in 439 or soon thereafter, and certainly during the lifetime of Emperor Theodosius II, i.e., before 450. The purpose of the history is to continue the work of Eusebius of Caesarea (1.1). It relates in simple Greek language what the Church experienced from the days of Constantine to the writer's time. Ecclesiastical dissensions occupy the foreground, for when the Church is at peace, there is nothing for the church historian to relate (7.48.7). In the preface to Book 5, Socrates defends dealing with Arianism and with political events in addition to writing about the church.\n\n[8] Secret history: Paul Levinson's \"The Plot to Save Socrates\" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher Socrates did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general Alcibiades had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous fourth-century mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor Hero of Alexandria was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the nineteenth-century publisher William Henry Appleton had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited Classical Greece and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.\n\n[9] Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon Sr.: Socrates Tryon was born on January 24, 1816, Pawlet Township, Vermont, to Laura Hotchkiss and Jesse Tryon. The younger Tryon was educated at Castleton Medical College in Rutland County, graduating in the Spring of 1836. His grandfather, Socrates Hotchkiss, was also a physician in Vermont. Socrates Tryon later moved to the Iowa Territory where he lived in Linn County and served as the clerk for the United States District Court in 1840. The territorial governor had appointed him as sheriff of the county in January 1839, but Tryon declined the position. Tyron represented Linn and Benton counties at Iowa's Second Constitutional Convention held in May 1846, which led to the admission of Iowa into the Union in December of that year. Tyron then moved to California with his wife, Frances (née Safley), and son, Socrates Hotchkiss Tryon Jr., before moving north to the Oregon Territory. There he was one of the first physicians in Oregon, settling a donation land claim in 1850 near what later became the city of Lake Oswego.\n\n[10] Crito: The dialogue begins with Socrates waking up to the presence of Crito in his prison cell and inquiring whether it is early in the day. Crito informs Socrates that it is indeed early and that he, Crito, chose to let Socrates sleep in peace, especially given Socrates' current distressful circumstance of awaiting his own execution. Crito explains that he admires the peaceful manner in which Socrates has heretofore lived and the level of calm that Socrates displays in the face of death. Socrates replies that it is only fitting that he react in such a manner given his age, and expresses surprise that the guard has let Crito into his cell at such an early hour. Crito informs Socrates that he is well-acquainted with the guard and has done him a certain benefaction.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10].\n\nNo, answer is not present in [1", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

The illegality of esport gambling has created a black market related to esports and virtual currency, as these go unregulated, may encourage match-fixing by players themselves, and lead to concerns about underage gambling due to the draw of video games. One such example of this is skin gambling, where virtual items earned in games were used as a currency for users to bet on the outcome of matches.\n\n[2] Match fixing investigations of Norwegian 2. divisjon: Follo FK's trainer, Hans Erik Eriksen on July 14, 2012, admitted to having been involved in \"illegal acts, linked to the same environment that is being investigated in the [alleged] match fixing case\".\n\n[3] Match fixing: By the end of the 19th century gambling was illegal in most jurisdictions, but that did not stop its widespread practice. Boxing soon became rife with fighters \"taking a dive\", likely due to boxing being a sport involving individual competitors, which makes its matches much easier to fix without getting caught. Baseball also became plagued by match fixing despite efforts by the National League to stop gambling at its games. Matters finally came to a head in 1919 when eight members of the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series (see Black Sox Scandal). In an effort to restore confidence, Major League Baseball established the office of the Commissioner of Baseball, and one of Kenesaw Mountain Landis's first acts was to ban all involved players for life.\n\n[4] Marco Cecchinato: On 20 July 2016, Cecchinato was suspended for 18 months (until January 2018) and fined €40,000 by the Italian tennis federation for illegal behavior including match fixing and match betting. He successfully appealed against that decision.\n\n[5] Proposition bet: Spot-fixing is an illegal activity where a person involved in the game takes steps to ensure a certain result for a proposition bet. Instead of fixing an entire match, or shaving points, spot fixing can be done with as little as one player, and can involve ensuring a certain outcome on only a single play, and may be completely unrelated to the points/results in a game.\n\n[6] Korea e-Sports Association: In April 2010, eleven \"Starcraft\" players were implicated for match-fixing during the 2009 e-Sports season. The Sanction Subcommittee of KeSPA banned them from playing e-Sports in the future, and those implicated are due to be charged in criminal courts by KeSPA, as well as professional gaming teams. Along with progamers, the owners of over twelve illegal gambling websites, and former players and staff members will be charged. It is alleged that players were bribed to leak information, or lose games, allowing owners of the illegal gambling site to obtain huge profits. There was an outcry in Korea following these developments.\n\n[7] Sports betting: The National Football League is fully against any sort of legalization of sports betting, strongly protesting it as to not bring corruption into the game. On the other hand, the CEO of the International Cricket Council believe sports betting, in particular in India, should be legalized to curb illegal bookies where match fixing has occurred from nontransparent bookmakers. Many of the illegal proceeds also allegedly go to fund terror, drugs and other illegal activities.\n\n[8] 2008 Australian Open: On 21 December 2007, organizers of the event announced that the tournament would be watched under the scrutiny of anti-corruption officials. A partnership was formed with Victoria Police. This announcement came in the wake of a series of scandals to hit the sport, including World No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko coming under suspicion of match fixing; with at least a dozen other players coming forward about having been approached to influence matches in an unethical manner. Tennis Australia chief executive Steve Wood commented that, \"Match-fixing and illegal gambling are a threat to the integrity of sport. We're putting our policies, procedures and programme in place to protect it.\"\n\n[9] Match fixing: On December 2, 1896, former Old West lawman Wyatt Earp refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match, promoted as the Heavyweight Championship of the World. Earp was chosen as referee by the National Athletic Association the afternoon of the match after both managers refused to agree on a choice. In the eighth round of a fight dominated by Fitzsimmons, Sharkey suddenly went down, clutching his groin, yelling foul. Referee Earp conferred with both corners for a few seconds before he disqualified Fitzsimmons for a foul that virtually no one saw. Fitzsimmons went to court to attempt to stop Shakey from taking the purse, but failed when the court ruled that the match was illegal and it had no jurisdiction.\n\n[10] 2011 South Korean football betting scandal: After an arrest warrant was issued for two football players on 25 May 2011 by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, the K-League's match-fixing case began to surface. The prosecutors arrested two brokers and are investigating 10 players, including Sangju Sangmu Phoenix's striker and former national team member Kim Dong-hyun. The inception of this scandal was the alleged suicide of one footballer named Yoon Ki-Won of Incheon United. His suicide was amplified with the match-fixing allegations through media and football fans. But K-League trying to purified itself and other persons who were involved in match-fixing didn't appear, match-fixing scandal was an open secret in K-League through the illegal betting sites.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], and [10].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please select one of the following options:\n\nYes, answer is present\nI don't know", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nThe reason is because there are several contexts which give information related to the question, for example [1], [2], [4], [5], [6], and [10].

When an open-circuit scuba diver inhales, a quantity of highly compressed gas from his cylinder is reduced in pressure by a regulator, and enters the lungs at a much higher volume than it occupied in the cylinder. This means that the diver has a tendency to rise slightly with each inhalation, and sink slightly with each exhalation. This does not happen to a rebreather diver, because the diver is circulating a roughly constant volume of gas between his lungs and the breathing bag. This is not specifically an advantage or disadvantage, but it requires some practice to adjust to the difference.\n\n[2] Kent Bach: In his paper, \"Content Ex Machina\" Bach argues against over-interpreting what he labels the \"contextualist platitude\" which he defines as: “Generally what a speaker means in uttering a sentence, even if the sentence is devoid of ambiguity, vagueness, or indexicality, goes beyond what the sentence means.” Bach asserts that context does not establish meaning but is merely one of several conversational principles. He states that “context does not determine (in the sense of constitute), but merely enables the hearer to determine (in the sense of ascertain) what the speaker means.” Context provides constraints on what a speaker can reasonably mean and on what a hearer can reasonably interpret a speaker to mean. “contextualist platitude” does not preclude the “older picture of language and communication” and “a fairly standard semantic-pragmatic distinction.” Pragmatic considerations and context do not contribute to the content of what is said. Bach admits that there is meaning in utterances beyond the semantic content of a sentence, but he maintains that context does not determine speaker meaning but rather constrains how a speaker can expect to be understood and helps the hearer understand what is said. “We need the level of locutionary act and, correlatively, a strict, semantic notion of what is said in order to account for (the content of) what a speaker does in uttering a sentence independent\n\n[3] Odinani: Dibia are the mystic mediators between the human world and the spirit world and act as healers, scribes, teachers, diviners and advisors of people in the community. They are usually consulted at the shrine of a communities major deity. \"Dibia\" is a compound of the words \"di\" ('professional, master, husband') + \"ọ́bị̀à\" ('doctoring, sciences'). The dibia are believed to be destined for spiritual work. The dibia sees the spiritual world at any time and interprets what messages being sent and sees the spiritual problems of living people. They are given the power by the spirit world to identify any alusi by name and the possible ways of placating and negotiating with the deity. Dibia are thought to be revealed to possess the power over one of three elements namely water (and large bodies of water), fire and vegetation. Dibia whose elements are vegetation can go on to become herbalists by their supposed instinctual knowledge of the health benefits of certain plants they are instinctually drawn to, fire element dibia can handle fire unscathed during their initiation, and water element dibia do not drown. Dibia can partially enter the spirit world and communicate this by rubbing chalk on one half of their face. Dibia and obia practices were transported to the British Caribbean during the slave trade and became known as obeah.\n\n[4] Di indigetes: To support his analysis Anttilla cites a medical term \"indigo/indigere\" meaning to drive bodily fluids, which is not attested in ancient texts. A hard tumor (scirosis) 'fit ex glutinoso et spisso humore quod confluendo ita membris indigitur ut insitus locis ubi considerit unum esse videatur': the tumor is formed by humours that run together to a certain location by pushing the limbs from the inside so as it looks one thing with the limb where they set. So tumors are pushed in as tubers and plants. Although the lexicographic evidence is flimsy Anttilla thinks it is important owing to the close relation between medicine and religion. \"Indiges, indigere\" would hint to something coming out and bringing forth an end result (pushing into a state). Drive in is at the same time come out. The richness of nature deities or their epithets (ahtu) brings about the beneficial result of life/food. The coordinator would be Iuppiter Indiges, the Impeller corresponding to \"Zeus Ageetoor\" at Sparta.\n\n[5] Discordianism: The \"Principia Discordia\", if read literally, encourages the worship of Eris, known in Latin as Discordia, the goddess of disorder, or archetypes and ideals associated with her. Depending on the version of Discordianism, Eris might be considered the goddess exclusively of disorder or the goddess of disorder and chaos. Both views are supported by the \"Principia Discordia\". The \"Principia Discordia\" holds three core principles: the Aneristic (order), the Eristic (disorder), and the notion that both are mere illusions. Due to these principles, a Discordian believes there is no distinction between disorder and chaos, since the only difference between the two is that one refers to 'order'. This is likely a major reason for the inconsistency in the wording. An argument presented by the text is that it is only by rejecting these principles that you can truly perceive reality as it is, chaos.\n\n[6] Diver trim: This is seldom much of a problem, and can be corrected by simply trimming the shoulders up until the air balances between the sides. It does however mean that if the diver rolls to one side air will shift to the upper side and tend to hold the diver in this position. Similarly if a diver trims steeply head up or down, the air will flow to the higher end of the BC and this will tend to keep the diver stable in this position. This can be exacerbated by similar but more extreme air shifts in a dry suit, which is the main reason why dry suits should be dived with the minimum air necessary to expand the undersuit.\n\n[7] Buddy diving: Diving takes place in what Cousteau called \"The Silent World.\" The relative silence of the sea is one of the enjoyable aspects of scuba diving, but does not help foster natural means of communication within a buddy team. If they haven't invested in expensive full-face masks that incorporate through-water voice transmission, buddy divers must communicate via non-audible means: standardized hand signals or submersible writing slates.\n\n[8] Dusios: \"Dusii\" are among the supernatural influences and magical practices that threaten marriages, as noted by Hincmar in his 9th-century treatise \"De divortio Lotharii\" (\"On Lothar's divorce\"): \"Certain women have even been found to have submitted to sleeping with Dusii in the form of men who were burning with love.\" In the same passage, Hincmar warns of sorceresses (\"sorciariae\"), witches (\"strigae\"), female vampires (\"lamiae\"), and magic in the form of \"objects bewitched by spells, compounded from the bones of the dead, ashes and dead embers, hair taken from the head and pubic area of men and women, multicoloured little threads, various herbs, snails' shell and snake bits.\" The form \"Dusiolus\", a diminutive, appears in a sermon with the beings \"aquatiquus\" (from \"aqua\", \"water\") and \"Geniscus\", possibly a form of the Roman Genius or the Gallic Genius Cucullatus whose hooded form suggested or represented a phallus. According to \"country people\" (\"rustici homines\"), these and witches (\"striae\") threaten infants and cattle.\n\n[9] Surface-supplied diving: The stand by diver will be prepared in the same way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the stand-by diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand-by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the \n\n[10] Idis (Germanic): Simek says that the West Germanic term \"Idisi\" (Old Saxon \"idis\", Old High German \"itis\", Anglo-Saxon \"ides\") refers to a \"dignified, well respected woman (married or unmarried), possibly a term for any woman, and therefore glosses exactly Latin \"matrona\"\" and that a link to the North Germanic term \"dísir\" is reasonable to assume, yet that it is not undisputed. In addition, the place name Idisiaviso (meaning \"plain of the Idisi\") where forces commanded by Arminius fought those commanded by Germanicus at the Battle of the Weser River in 16 CE. Simek points to a connection between name Idisiaviso, the role of the Idisi in one of the two Merseburg Incantations, and valkyries. Regarding the dísir, Simek states that Old Norse \"dís\" appears commonly as simply a term for 'woman,' just as Old High German \"itis\", Old Saxon \"idis\", and Anglo-Saxon \"ides\", and may have also been used to denote a type of goddess. According to Simek, \"several of the Eddic sources might lead us to conclude that the \"disir\" were valkyrie-like guardians of the dead, and indeed in \"Guðrúnarkviða\" I 19 the valkyries are even called \"Herjans disir\" 'Odin's disir'. The \"disir\" are explicitly called dead\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the contexts in which the word \"diver\" appears.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

On the last day at sea \"Fitch\" wrecked her propeller on a reef and had to return to Pearl Harbor. The aircraft carriers departed for Okinawa on 14 March, and the eleven remaining sweeps of MinRon 20 left on the 19th. Given the nature of their task, the minesweepers had to be the first surface vessels at the target area and unlike the carriers, they headed directly to Okinawa, making the voyage in four days. While the four day journey was uneventful, the two threats the minesweepers faced were Japanese air attacks and the deteriorating weather. \"Hobson\" arrived at Okinawa well in advance of the assault troops to sweep the offshore areas, where she was often attacked by Japanese planes. In the early hours of L-Day, she and \"Emmons\" were on radar picket duty with \"Hobson\" as fire support ship. As the amphibious assault began on 1 April 1945, \"Hobson\" also took up patrol duties and provided night illumination during the first critical days of the campaign. As des\n\n[2] USS Hobson (DD-464): \"Hobson\" received six battle stars for World War II service, five in the European theater and one in the Asiatic Pacific theater, and shared in the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the ships in the \"Bogue\" antisubmarine task group in the Atlantic, for the period 26 February to 25 March 1944.\n\n[3] USS Hobson (DD-464): \"Hobson\", constructed at a cost of $5 million, was launched at the Charleston Navy Yard on 8 September 1941; sponsored by Mrs. Grizelda Hobson, widow of Rear Admiral Hobson. As the new destroyer slid down the ways, she was cheered on by spectators and whistle blasts from other vessels on the Cooper River. \"Hobson\" was commissioned on 22 January 1942, Commander R. N. McFarlane in command.\n\n[4] USS Hobson (DD-464): The German shore batteries, having discovered the Allied invaders, began firing on the armada at 0530. At 0536, the group commander made the signal \"Commence counter battery bombardment.\", 14 minutes ahead of schedule. \"Hobson\" and the other ships began counter-firing as spent 5\" and 8\" shell casings littered their decks. Only the heavy ships had planes to spot for them. The destroyers were close enough to see their targets which consisted mostly of \"strong points\" just back of the beaches. \"Hobson\", at station 1, was assigned firing on targets 70 and 72. At 0629, \"Hobson\" observed shell splashes near and at 0633, \"Corry\" appeared to be hit amidships. As smoke from the intense shore firing drifted offshore and temporarily concealed \"Corry\", \"Hobson\" shifted her fire at 0638 to target 86 which appeared to have been firing on \"Corry\". This battery temporarily ceased firing as soon as taken under fire by \"Hobson\". At 0644, the destroyer shifted her fire back to targets 70 and 72 since the leading boat wave was close to shore and neutralization of German firing from those areas was vital. At 0656, the smoke was extremely heavy on the beach, making it difficult to see the targets, and \"Hobson\", per her prior firing orders, estimated that the first \n\n[5] USS Hobson (DD-464): Since target 74 was then inactive, \"Hobson\" began alternately taking targets 13A and 86 under fire while keeping watch on target 74. At 0721, it was clear that \"Corry\" was sinking and \"Hobson\" began to close range on her while continuing her firing on the two targets. At that time, the group commander ordered to stand by the \"Corry\" since \"Hobson\"s mission of covering the landing beach flank was vital. By then the German shore batteries at 13A and 86 had ceased firing, and \"Hobson\" lowered her two boats to assist \"Fitch\" in picking up the \"Corry\"s survivors. \"Hobson\" then resumed her station and continued firing on target 74 and a nearby roadblock and strong point. At 0854, according to schedule, relieved \"Hobson\" at her station, and \"Hobson\" was ordered to assume \"Corry\"s fire support mission at station 3. \"Hobson\" continued firing on German shore positions while simultaneously rescuing survivors from the water until returning to Plymouth, England later that afternoon. The destroyer was not long out of the fray, however, returning on 8 June 1944 to screen the assault area. She also jammed glider bomb radio frequencies on 9–11 June and provided channel convoy protection.\n\n[6] USS Hobson (DD-464): During one such operation on the night of 26 April 1952 at 2220, \"Hobson\" was steaming in formation with the aircraft carrier and destroyer about southeast of St. John's, Newfoundland at during night flight operations en route to Gibraltar. \"Hobson\" was moving at 24 knots and following the carrier 3,000 yards off her starboard quarter with \"Rodman\" following \"Wasp\" off her port quarter. \"Hobson\"s commanding officer, Lt. Comdr. William J. Tierney, had been in command of the ship for 5 weeks. He anticipated that \"Wasp\", preparing to recover her aircraft at 2300, would change course to 250–260 degrees to bring the carrier into the wind, necessary for the aircraft landings. The destroyer's executive officer, Lt. William A. Hoefer, was on the bridge with the conn and control of the ship when Tierney outlined a course to maneuver \"Hobson\" ahead of \"Wasp\" and then come up on the massive carrier's port quarter as the destroyer's new station. \"Rodman\" would move to the starboard quarter as her new station. Hoefer, who had been on \"Hobson\" for 16 months, was immediately concerned when he saw Tierney's plan and turned the conn over to Lt. Donald Cummings, so that he could voice his opposition and belief that Tierney's maneuver would put the two ships\n\n[7] USS Hobson (DD-464): The unconditional surrender of Imperial Japan came with \"Hobson\" still undergoing repairs. With repairs completed and after shakedown training, she spent February 1946 on mine-sweeping operations out of Yorktown, Virginia. The remainder of the year was spent in training and readiness exercises in the Caribbean and off Norfolk. Until 1950, the ship continued to operate off the East Coast and in Caribbean waters on amphibious and mine warfare operations. In late 1948, she visited Argentia and Halifax, Nova Scotia on mine-sweeping exercises with Canadian ships. With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, \"Hobson\"s schedule of training intensified. She took part in amphibious exercises off North Carolina and Puerto Rico during 1950–51, and participated in carrier operations as a plane guard and screening ship.\n\n[8] USS Hobson (DD-464): For some time the Allies had been building up tremendous strength in England for the eventual invasion of France. \"Hobson\" and the other three destroyers of DesDiv 20, \"Corry\", \"Forrest\" and \"Fitch\", sailed from Norfolk on 21 April 1944 to join the vast armada of Operation Neptune that would transport and protect the soldiers and their mechanized equipment during Operation Overlord. \"Hobson\" spent a month on patrol off Northern Ireland, arriving at Plymouth on 21 May for final invasion preparations. Assigned to Rear Admiral Don P. Moon's Utah Beach Assault Group \"U\", flag on the , \"Hobson\" and her three sister-ships of DesDiv 20 were elements of Bombardment Group 125.8 that comprised the battleship , the heavy cruisers , , British cruiser , monitor , ten American destroyers, four British destroyers and a Dutch gunboat.\n\n[9] USS Hobson (DD-464): \"Hobson\"s executive officer, Lt. Robert M. Vogel gave this account: On 16 April 1945 at 0500 and 75 miles northwest of Okinawa, fifteen enemy planes spotted \"Hobson\", and two accompanying gunboats and made passes at the ships; however, the attackers were driven off by anti-aircraft fire. At 0853, one of the planes made a suicide run on \"Pringle\" but was shot down by gunners on both \"Hobson\" and \"Pringle\". Another dived on \"Pringle\" at 0920, slamming into the destroyer's bridge, and plowing through the superstructure deck, abaft the base of number one stack. A single 1,000-pound bomb, or two 500-pounders, penetrated the main and superstructure decks and exploded with a violent eruption, buckling the keel and splitting the vessel in two at the forward fire room. \"Pringle\" sank in six minutes.\n\n[10] USS Hobson (DD-464): As the Allied offensive in Europe gained momentum, \"Hobson\" steamed as a convoy escort between Algeria, Italy, and France protecting vital supplies and troops. In the early morning darkness of 2 October 1944, \"Hobson\" was standing out from Marseilles, France during a violent gale, when her spotters observed distress calls from well inside an unswept area of the German- mined harbor. It was soon established that a liberty ship, the \"S.S. Johns Hopkins\", moving to an anchorage after returning from Oran, Algeria with 600 troops embarked, had struck a mine while navigating in the gale. Ordered to assist the stricken \"Hopkins\", \"Hobson\" skillfully and carefully navigated through the perilous, mined area in gale-force wind and sea, and made repeated attempts to land alongside the liberty ship to offload her troops, although each time \"Hobson\" was forced to back off as the ships pounded heavily in the extreme weather. Through Lt. Cdr. Loveland's skillful ship-handling and that of his deck crew, the damage to \"Hobson\" was superficial. \"Hobson\" remained close aboard the stricken cargo ship until daylight when safe water was finally reached, the ships having crossed thirteen and one-half miles of unswept water. \"Hobson\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nNo.\n\nPlease answer with a \"Yes\" or \"No\" as to whether the information you need is present in any of the contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "No, answer is not present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nThe answer to the question \"How much does the USS Hobson weigh?\" is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

The exception came with \"The Big Bang Theory\". After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of Sheldon Cooper would be a very good fit for him. Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers \"brilliantly use those words that most of us don't recognize to create that rhythm. And the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue, and in a lot of ways still is.\"\n\n[2] Sheldon Cooper: Sheldon Lee Cooper, Ph.D., Sc.D., is a fictional character in the CBS television series \"The Big Bang Theory\" and its spinoff series \"Young Sheldon\", portrayed by actors Jim Parsons in \"The Big Bang Theory\" and Iain Armitage in \"Young Sheldon\" (with Parsons as the latter series' narrator). For his portrayal, Parsons has won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a TCA Award, and two Critics' Choice Television Awards. The character's childhood is the focus of \"Young Sheldon\": the series' first season is set in 1989 when nine-year-old prodigy Sheldon has skipped ahead five grades, to start high school alongside his older brother.\n\n[3] The Big Bang Theory: On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off \"Young Sheldon\" series. Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot. Created by Lorre and Molaro, the series follows 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper as he attends high school in East Texas. Alongside Armitage as 9-year-old Sheldon Cooper and Perry as Mary Cooper, Lance Barber stars as George Cooper, Sheldon's father; Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak will also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television. The show's pilot episode premiered on September 25, 2017. Subsequent weekly episodes began airing on November 2, 2017 following the broadcast of the 237th episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\".\n\n[4] The Big Bang Theory (season 2): Season two begins to deal with character development, including Sheldon becoming more and more obsessive. Leonard and Penny's relationship takes a turn for the worse when they break up, but this is quickly resolved. Soon their relationship progresses into a stronger friendship than before, while Sheldon and Penny's friendship slowly begins. In the season finale Penny hints at her true feelings for Leonard. Howard's character remains similar to that of season one in his attempts to seduce women, managing to start a short-lived sexual relationship with Leslie Winkle in the second half of the season. Meanwhile, Rajesh manages to briefly apologize to Penny for what he did in \"The Griffin Equivalency\" without having consumed alcohol. Barry Kripke played by John Ross Bowie makes his first appearance In the series starting with this season, He first appears in \"The Killer Robot Instability\". Compared to season one, the second season received more favorable reception. Jessica Paff of Screener wrote that \"if they can keep the funny coming, I will keep watching\", Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the improvements to the character of Sheldon Cooper, writing that \"Prickly Sheldon has become a character to love, and [actor Jim] Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic\", and James Chamberlin of \"IGN\" wrote that \"Jim Parsons is a riot and is reason enough\n\n[5] Young Sheldon: Young Sheldon (stylized as young Sheldon) is an American comedy television series on CBS created by Chuck Lorre and Steven Molaro.

Iain Armitage stars as young Sheldon, alongside Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, and Annie Potts. Jim Parsons, who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on \"The Big Bang Theory\", narrates the series and serves as an executive producer.\n\n[6] Cultural influence of Star Trek: The main characters from the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\", especially Sheldon Cooper, make various references to and are big fans of \"Star Trek\", with Sheldon even citing Starfleet regulations during an argument in one episode and the main characters dressing up as Data, Worf, Captain Picard and a Borg drone, respectively, in another. Also the series features Wil Wheaton in a recurring role as a fictionalized version of himself plus guest appearances from Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton, and a voice-only cameo from Leonard Nimoy, who voices a Mr. Spock action figure talking to Sheldon in his dreams. There was also an appearance of a Gorn in one episode.\n\n[7] Young Sheldon: In early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, as well as Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on \"The Big Bang Theory\". Lance Barber stars as George Cooper Sr., Sheldon's father; he had previously appeared in one episode of \"The Big Bang Theory\". Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; and Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. In July 2017, Annie Potts was cast as Meemaw, Sheldon's grandmother.\n\n[8] Young Sheldon: In November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of \"The Big Bang Theory\" centered on Sheldon Cooper as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \"a \"Malcolm in the Middle\"-esque single-camera family comedy\" would be executive produced by \"The Big Bang Theory\" co-creator Chuck Lorre and producer Steven Molaro, with \"The Big Bang Theory\" co-creator Bill Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017–18 season alongside \"The Big Bang Theory\". The initial idea for the series came from Jim Parsons (who portrays the older Sheldon on \"The Big Bang Theory\"), who passed it along to \"The Big Bang Theory\" producers. On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off \"Young Sheldon\" series, which was created by Lorre and Molaro. Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot.

On September 27, 2017, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. On January 6, 2018, the show was renewed for a second season. The second season premiered on September 24, 2018.\n\n[9] Sheldon Cooper: Both the character and Parsons' portrayal have received widespread acclaim, and is often cited as the main reason for the program's success by critics and fans alike. James Chamberlin of IGN wrote: \"It's hard to imagine what \"The Big Bang Theory\" would be if it weren't for Jim Parsons' great portrayal of Sheldon Cooper\". Matt Roush of \"TV Guide\" stated that \"there's a spark of divine inspiration in Jim Parsons' uproarious Sheldon Cooper\". Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that: \"Parsons is doing something rare on network TV: making intellectualism admirable, even heroic\".\n\n[10] List of The Big Bang Theory characters: Sheldon Lee Cooper (Jim Parsons) is a theoretical physicist, possessing a BS, MS, PhD, a Sc.D., and an IQ of 187. Born in East Texas, he was a child prodigy, and received his PhD at age 16 from Harvard University. He is often cold, self-centered, condescending, and immature, but is not intentionally hurtful: his conduct is generally well-intentioned, but poorly judged. He has a softer side, as he does care about his friends, and loves his family and girlfriend Amy Farrah Fowler, though he often insults them either about their intellect levels or different opinions. In seasons 1–9, he shares an apartment in Pasadena with friend and fellow physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, Sheldon Cooper's one-word catchphrase in The Big Bang Theory is \"Bazinga!\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

This region contains the most prominent and numerous outflow channels on Mars. The channels flow east or north into the plain.In this region it is particularly difficult to distinguish outflow channels from lava channels but the following features have been suggested as at least overprinted by outflow channel floods:Several channels flow either onto the plains of Amazonis and Elysium from the southern highlands, or originate at graben within the plains. This region contains some of the youngest channels. Some of these channels have rare tributaries, and they do not start at a chaos region. It has been suggested the formation mechanisms for these channels may be more variable than for those around Chryse Planitia, perhaps in some cases involving lake breaches at the surface.Several outflow channels rise in the region west of the Elysium volcanic province and flow northwestward to the Utopia Planitia. As common in the Amazonis and Elysium Planitiae regions, these channels tend to originate in graben. Some of these channels may be influenced by lahars, as indicated by their surface textures and ridged, lobate deposits at their margins and termini. The valleys of Hephaestus Fossae and Hebrus Valles are of extremely unusual form, and although sometimes claimed as outflow channels,\n\n[2] Elysium Planitia: NASA's \"InSight\" mission landed on Elysium Planitia on November 26, 2018. It took off from Earth on the 5th May 2018. The probe will study the internal structure of Mars and by so doing improve understanding of the planet's evolution. InSight Mars lander was able to take color pictures from the surface Elysium Planitia and sent them by radio signal back to Earth. During the descent sequence two additional items were jettisoned, the backshell with parachute, and heat shield, and they impacted in the vicinity of the lander.\n\n[3] Elysium Planitia: The largest craters in Elysium Planitia are Eddie, Lockyer, and Tombaugh. The planitia also has river valleys—one of which, Athabasca Valles may be one of the youngest on Mars. On the north east side is an elongated depression called Orcus Patera, and this and some of the eastern plains were imaged in the 1965 Mariner 4 flyby.\n\n[4] Elysium Planitia: Elysium Planitia, located in the Elysium and Aeolis quadrangles, is a broad plain that straddles the equator of Mars, centered at . It lies to the south of the volcanic province of Elysium, the second largest volcanic region on the planet, after Tharsis. Elysium contains the major volcanoes Elysium Mons, Albor Tholus and Hecates Tholus. Another more ancient shield volcano, Apollinaris Mons, is situated just to the south of eastern Elysium Planitia.\n\n[5] Hellas Planitia: Hellas Planitia is antipodal to Alba Patera. It and the somewhat smaller Isidis Planitia together are roughly antipodal to the Tharsis Bulge, with its enormous shield volcanoes, while Argyre Planitia is roughly antipodal to Elysium, the other major uplifted region of shield volcanoes on Mars. Whether the shield volcanoes were caused by antipodal impacts like that which produced Hellas, or if it is mere coincidence, is unknown.\n\n[6] Elysium (volcanic province): Elysium, located in the Elysium and Cebrenia quadrangles, is the second largest volcanic region on Mars, after Tharsis. The region includes the volcanoes (from north to south) Hecates Tholus, Elysium Mons and Albor Tholus. The province is centered roughly on Elysium Mons at . Elysium Planitia is a broad plain to the south of Elysium, centered at . Another large volcano, Apollinaris Mons, lies south of Elysium Planitia and is not part of the province. Besides having large volcanoes, Elysium has several areas with long trenches, called fossa or fossae (plural) on Mars. They include the Cerberus Fossae, Elysium Fossae, Galaxias Fossae, Hephaestus Fossae, Hyblaeus Fossae, Stygis Fossae and Zephyrus Fossae.\n\n[7] Avernus Colles: Avernus Colles is a region of fractured terrain on Mars on the southeast margin of Elysium Planitia, at 1.6°S, 171°E. It is fairly large, being 244 km (152 mi) in diameter. Avernus Colles can be found in the Elysium quadrangle. It was named in 1985 after a lake in Campania, Italy, which is believed by some to be an entrance to the underworld.\n\n[8] Elysium quadrangle: The name Elysium refers to a place of reward (Heaven), according to Homer in the Odyssey. The Elysium quadrangle covers the area 180° to 225° west longitude and 0° to 30° north latitude on Mars. Elysium Planitia is in the Elysium quadrangle. The Elysium quadrangle includes a part of Lucus Planum. A small part of the Medusae Fossae Formation lies in this quadrangle. The largest craters in this quadrangle are Eddie, Lockyer, and Tombaugh. Elysium contains major volcanoes named Elysium Mons and Albor Tholus and river valleys—one of which, Athabasca Valles may be one of the youngest on Mars. On the east side is an elongated depression called Orcus Patera. A large lake may once have existed in the south near Lethe Valles and Athabasca Valles.\n\n[9] Amazonis Planitia: Amazonis Planitia is one of the smoothest plains on Mars. It is located between the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces, to the west of Olympus Mons, in the Amazonis and Memnonia quadrangles, centered at . The plain's topography exhibits extremely smooth features at several different lengths of scale. A large part of the Medusae Fossae Formation lies in Amazonis Planitia.\n\n[10] Athabasca Valles: Some authors have proposed that a combination of mechanisms can satisfactorily explain the origin of the Athabasca Valles system - namely, the large-scale emplacement of low-viscosity lava flows on top of pre-existing glaciers. Apart from ice interactions, this large-scale low-viscosity volcanic efflux is thought to have formed up to a third of the modern Martian surface and has been analogized to Earth's large igneous provinces (LIPs). Individual periods of volcanic activity constituting the modern Elysium Planitia region are thought to have lasted up to 1 Myr, with the rock in the vicinity of Athabasca Valles being potentially deposited on a timescale of weeks or months. Given the obliquity of Mars during this part of the Amazonian, it has been hypothesized that glaciers were likely actively accumulating in this region of Elysium Planitia at the same time as this period of volcanism.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.

The Pacific typhoon season during 2010 was in fact less active than the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, the only such occurrence other than 2005. In the same year, the Pacific hurricane season broke the same record being the least active season on record. During the season no storms have made landfall in mainland Japan, the only second such occurrence since 1988. Also, all of the 14 named storms developed west of 150°E. Moreover, the season had an index total Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) of 115, which is the second lowest in the basin after 1999. It was also the fourth consecutive year with a below average ACE index.\n\n[2] 1994 Pacific typhoon season: The 1994 Pacific typhoon season was an extremely active season in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Western North Pacific, with a total of 32 tropical storms, where 19 of them reached typhoon strength, during the course of the season, much like the Pacific hurricane season. The season had no official bounds and it ran year-round in 1994, but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. Tropical storms that formed west of the date line were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The World Meteorological Organization-designated Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre for tropical cyclones for the region is the Japan Meteorological Agency. Tropical depressions that entered or formed in the Philippine area of responsibility were assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This resulted in some storms having two names.\n\n[3] 2017 Pacific typhoon season: The 2017 Pacific typhoon season was a below-average season in terms of Accumulated Cyclone Energy and the number of typhoons and super typhoons, and the first and latest since the 1977 season to not produce a Category 5-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The season produced a total of 27 named storms, 11 typhoons, and only two super typhoons, making it an average season in terms of storm numbers. It was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season runs throughout 2017, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Muifa, developed on April 25, while the season's last named storm, Tembin, dissipated on December 26. This season also featured the latest occurrence of the first typhoon of the year since 1998, with Noru reaching this intensity on July 23.\n\n[4] 1948 Pacific typhoon season: The 1948 Pacific typhoon season is an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season runs throughout 1948, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\n[5] 2015 Pacific typhoon season: The 2015 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly above average season that produced 27 tropical storms, 18 typhoons, and nine super typhoons. The season ran throughout 2015, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and November. The season's first named storm, Mekkhala, developed on January 15, while the season's last named storm, Melor, dissipated on December 17. The season saw at least one named tropical system forming in each of every month, the first time since 1965. Similar to the previous season, this season saw a high number of super typhoons. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) during 2015 was extremely high, the second highest since the 1970, and the 2015 ACE has been attributed in part to anthropogenic warming.\n\n[6] 1949 Pacific typhoon season: The 1949 Pacific typhoon season is an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season runs throughout 1949, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100°E and 180th meridian. Within the northwestern Pacific Ocean, there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph) anywhere in the basin, whilst the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N–25°N regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the JMA. Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center are given a number with a \"W\" suffix.\n\n[7] 2019 Pacific typhoon season: The 2019 Pacific typhoon season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season runs throughout 2019, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Pabuk, developed on January 1, becoming the earliest-forming tropical storm of the western Pacific Ocean on record.\n\n[8] 2002 Pacific typhoon season: The 2002 Pacific typhoon season was an active season, with many tropical cyclones affecting Japan and China. Every month had tropical activity, with most storms forming from July through October. Overall, there were 44 tropical depressions declared officially or unofficially, of which 26 became named storms; of those, there were 15 typhoons, which is the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, while 8 of the 15 typhoon intensified into super typhoons unofficially by the JTWC.\n\n[9] 2018 Pacific typhoon season: The 2018 Pacific typhoon season was an above-average season producing 29 storms, 13 typhoons and 7 super typhoons. It was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation, in which tropical cyclones form in the western Pacific Ocean. The season ran throughout 2018, though most tropical cyclones typically develop between May and October. The season's first named storm, Bolaven, developed on January 3, while the season's last named storm, Man-yi, dissipated on November 28. The season's first typhoon, Jelawat, reached typhoon status on March 29, and became the first super typhoon of the year on the next day.\n\n[10] 1998 Pacific typhoon season: The 1998 Pacific typhoon season was one of the least active seasons on record, behind 2010, spawning 16 tropical storms and 8 typhoons. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see 1998 Pacific hurricane season. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions in this basin have the \"W\" suffix added to their number. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWhat is the typical Pacific typhoon season?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if the question is answered in any of the contexts provided, or \"I don't know\" if the question is not answered in any of the contexts.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nConfidence: 99%", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context 1.\n\nThe typical Pacific typhoon season is from May to October.", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

He was sent to the High School in Edinburgh.\n\n[2] Robert John Kerr: Robert John Kerr was born into a Protestant family in Portadown, County Armagh, Northern Ireland in about 1943. He joined the loyalist paramilitary organisation, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), shortly after its formation in Belfast in September 1971. It was an umbrella organisation of local vigilante groups that were set up following the outbreak of violent religious and political conflict known as the Troubles in the late 1960s, ostensibly for the defence of Protestant communities from nationalist gangs.\n\n[3] Robert Kirk (pathologist): He was born on 26 January 1905 in Glasgow the son of the Rev Robert Lee Kirk, a Church of Scotland minister, and his wife Primrose Adair Martin, daughter of John Martin, a brewer. He was educated at Greenock Academy then studied Zoology and Medicine at Glasgow University, winning the Gairdner Medal in medicine in 1930. He graduated MB ChB in Medicine and BSc in Zoology. His zoological studies were under Prof John Graham Kerr.\n\n[4] Robert Kerr (missionary): Robert Kerr was born in Glasgow, Scotland (date unknown), into a Presbyterian family. Originally practicing medicine in Scotland and England, Kerr was called upon by the Presbyterian Church of England to serve as both a medical and religious missionary to the people of Morocco. Sharing Kerr’s passion for religious mission work and care for the underprivileged, his wife Miss Jeffrey joined him in Morocco along with his children.\n\n[5] William Kerr (British Army officer, died 1741): Kerr was born before 1682, the third son of Robert Ker, 3rd Earl of Roxburghe, and his wife Lady Margaret Hay, daughter of John Hay, 1st Marquess of Tweeddale. In 1704 and 1705 he travelled abroad in Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Austria. He served with reputation on the Continent under John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. In 1709 he was rewarded with the command of a regiment of dragoons (later the 7th Hussars). He highly distinguished himself at the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November 1715, where, according to contemporary accounts, he had three horses killed under him, was wounded in the thigh, and had his coat torn by a pistol bullet. The care and attention which he paid to the interests of his corps procured him the affection and esteem of the officers and soldiers.\n\n[6] Ralph Kerr: Kerr was born on 16 August 1891, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Russell Kerr, and his wife Lady Kerr, of Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire. He joined the Royal Navy on 15 May 1904, and after service as a cadet he rose through the ranks, being promoted to Lieutenant on 28 February 1914. He served in the First World War, spending most of the period aboard the battleship HMS \"Benbow\", the flagship of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. He was present at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and by 1918 he had been given his own command, that of the destroyer HMS \"Cossack\".\n\n[7] Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram: He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst, and entered public life as laird of Ancrum in Roxburghshire. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Key, younger of Cessford. He was cousin to Robert Carr, the favourite of James VI. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of Prince Henry. The household of that time was more splendid and consisted of more people than the present royal household. He subsequently was employed by Prince Charles, who became his patron through life. Charles mediated a match between Sir Robert and the Lady Anne Stanley, daughter of the Earl of Derby.\n\n[8] Robert Malcolm Kerr: Born in Glasgow, the son of John Kerr (1791-1853), a writer for \"The Signet\", and Elizabeth (née Malcolm), 'Commissioner Kerr' was educated at the University of Glasgow and then become an Advocate at the Faculty of Advocates in his native Scotland in 1843 before moving to London where he became a barrister in Lincoln's Inn in 1848. By 1851 Kerr was a Deputy County Court Judge on the Northern Circuit, and also lectured on Law for the Incorporated Law Society; he also edited an edition of Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\". In 1857 he was awarded the degree of LL.D by the University of Glasgow. In 1859 he was the last person to be elected by the Common Council of the City of London as a Judge of the Sheriff's Court of the City of London and then became a Judge at the Guildhall Court in the City of London for 43 years. He twice failed to get into Parliament, and despite being offered an extremely generous pension, he refused to retire from his position at the City of London Court.\n\n[9] Alexander Robert Kerr: Kerr was born in 1770, the son of Robert Kerr, a Royal Navy lieutenant. In 1781 was joined the navy himself as midshipman on board the frigate HMS \"Endymion\", commanded by Captain James Gambier and from there served in a number of other vessels, including a period on HMS \"Boreas\" under Captain Horatio Nelson. In 1790 he was promoted to lieutenant and joined first HMS \"Narcissus\" and then the frigate HMS \"Boston\" under Captain George Courtenay.\n\n[10] Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset: Robert Kerr was born in Wrington, Somerset, England, the younger son of Sir Thomas Kerr (Carr) of Ferniehurst, Scotland, by his second wife, Janet, sister of Walter Scott of Buccleuch. About the year 1601, while an obscure page to George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar, he met Thomas Overbury in Edinburgh. The two became friends and travelled to London together. Overbury soon became secretary to Carr. When the latter embarked on his career at court, Overbury took the position of mentor, secretary, and political advisor to his more charismatic friend, becoming the brains behind Carr's steady rise to prominence.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know where Sir John Robert Kerr was born?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "None of the contexts answer the question about Sir John Robert Kerr's birthplace directly.

(Nearly all farms in Ireland are family farms.) In Ireland, average family farm income was 25,483 euros in 2012. Analysis by Teagasc (Ireland’s Agriculture and Food Development Authority) estimates that 37 percent of Irish farms are economically viable and an additional 30 percent are sustainable due to income from off-farm sources; 33 percent meet neither criterion and are considered economically vulnerable.\n\n[2] Agriculture in Upper Canada: The average cultivated farm size was about 30 acres of cleared land, and it would take a farmer a lifetime to accomplish that. Clearing rates averaged between 1.47 and 3.18 acres per year.\n\n[3] Agriculture in Paraguay: Another striking element of the 1981 agricultural census was the great disparity between small and large landholdings. According to the census, 1 percent of the nation's more than 273,000 farms covered 79 percent of the nation's farmland in use. These large farms had an average landholding of almost 7,300 hectares. Many of the largest holdings were cattle farms in the Chaco Department. By contrast, the smallest farms, which made up 35 percent of all farms, covered only 1 percent of the land, making the average size of a minifundio 1.7 hectares, or less than was necessary for one family's subsistence. Still, the 1981 census figures were somewhat more encouraging than those in the 1956 census, which showed that 1 percent of farms covered 87 percent of the land, and 46 percent of farms covered only 1 percent of the farmland. Another encouraging trend that the census quantified was the declining number of farms under 5 hectares in size and the growth of small to medium-size farms (5 to 99.9 hectares).\n\n[4] Standard of living in China: In China, as in other countries, an important determinant of the affluence of a household was the dependency ratio - the number of nonworkers supported by each worker. In 1985 the average cost of living for one person in urban areas was ¥732 a year, and the average state enterprise worker, even with food allowance and other benefits added to the basic wage, had difficulty supporting one other person. Two average wage earners, however, could easily support one dependent. Families with several workers and few or no dependents had substantial surplus earnings, which they saved or used to buy nonessential goods. An important positive influence on the per capita consumption levels of urban families was a decline in the number of dependents per urban worker, from 2.4 in 1964 to 0.7 in 1985. In farm families the dependency ratio fell from 1.5 in 1978 to 0.7 in 1985. Farm incomes rose rapidly in the 1980s under the stimulus of the responsibility system but on average remained considerably lower than urban incomes. Household surveys found that in 1985 average net per capita income for rural residents was ¥398, less than half the average per capita urban income, which was ¥821. The value of goods farmers produced and consumed themselves accounted for 31 percent of rural income in 1985. The largest component of income in kind was food, 58 percent of which was self-produced.\n\n[5] Economy of Burundi: In an article titled \"The Blood Cries Out,\" \"Foreign Policy (FP)\" reported that the Burundian population growth rate is 2.5 percent per year, more than double the average global pace, and that a Burundian woman has on average 6.3 children, nearly triple the international fertility rate. \"FP\" further reported that \"The vast majority of Burundians rely on subsistence farming, but under the weight of a booming population and in the long-standing absence of coherent policies governing land ownership, many people barely have enough earth to sustain themselves.\" In 2014, the average size for a farm was about one acre. \"FP\" added that \"The consequence is remarkable scarcity: In the 2013 Global Hunger Index, Burundi had the severest hunger and malnourishment rates of all 120 countries ranked.\"\n\n[6] Standard of living in China: Farm family members on average consumed much less of most major kinds of goods than urban residents. For instance, a household survey found in 1985 that the average urban dweller consumed 148 kilograms of vegetables, 20 kilograms of meat, 2.6 kilograms of sugar, and 8 kilograms of liquor. At the same time, a survey of rural households found that the average rural resident consumed 131 kilograms of vegetables, 11 kilograms of meat, 1.5 kilograms of sugar, and 4 kilograms of liquor. Differences of a similar nature existed for consumer durables.\n\n[7] Bollinger County, Missouri: Like it is in many rural areas, agriculture and farming plays a critical role in the economy of Bollinger County. The average size of a farm in the county is . The average value of agricultural products sold per farm was $21,451 while the average total farm production expenses per farm was $19,413. The average market value of all machinery and equipment per farm was $36,801 and 31.69% of land in farms consisted of harvested croplands. In the county, 93.65% of all farms were operated by a family or one individual. The average age of the principal farm owner in the county was 56 years old. The average number of cattle and calves per of all land in farms in the county was 14.10 while 0.61% of all cattle and cows were used for milking. There were of land in orchards in Bollinger County. The most common crops are soybeans for beans with harvested, corn for grain with harvested, and all wheat for grain with harvested.\n\n[8] Corporate farming: In the US, the average size of a non-family corporate farm is 1078 acres, i.e. smaller than the average family corporate farm (1249 acres) and smaller than the average partnership farm (1131 acres).\n\n[9] Cashew production in Tanzania: More than eighty-five percent of the farmers are small holder farmers and have an average farm size of 1 hectare. Most farmers are the elderly and rely on manual labour rather than machinery. Most youth from the rural areas prefer to move to the urban areas as cashew farming is less appealing to them. The lack of new blood and new investment in the farms have caused the trees to age and the trees in most locations are very old and have been reducing in yield over the years.\n\n[10] Economy of China: China is the world's largest producer and consumer of agricultural products – and some 300 million Chinese farm workers are in the industry, mostly laboring on pieces of land about the size of U.S farms. Virtually all arable land is used for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is among the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish. Major non-food crops, including cotton, other fibers, and oilseeds, furnish China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high because of intensive cultivation, for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total, but China still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United States. China hopes to further increase agricultural production through improved plant stocks, fertilizers, and technology.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWhat is the average farm size in China?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat caused the Dust Bowl?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Dust Bowl: In many regions, more than 75% of the topsoil was blown away by the end of the 1930s. Land degradation varied widely. Aside from the short-term economic consequences caused by erosion, there were severe long-term economic consequences caused by the Dust Bowl.\n\n[2] Last Man Club: During the Dust Bowl, many farmers around Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle Area experienced the worst of the Depression. By the time the summer of 1936 hit, they had already been experiencing dust storms, winds that carried away all the precious topsoil and made it impossible to grow crops, plagues of Grasshoppers and starving jackrabbits that devoured anything left over in their fields, and terrible Dust Pneumonia, caused by the dust that had settled over everything. Many farmers, about a quarter of the population of the panhandle, packed up their few belongings and left for California, nicknamed the \"Peach Bowl\", in search of jobs as fruit harvesters. However, of the ones that did, few found the jobs they searched for, and even they had extremely low wages. These job-searchers were nicknamed \"Okies\", as so many of them were from Oklahoma.\n\n[3] Jet stream: Evidence suggests the jet stream was at least partly responsible for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.\n\n[4] Dust Bowl: The crisis was documented by photographers, musicians, and authors, many hired during the Great Depression by the federal government. For instance, the Farm Security Administration hired numerous photographers to document the crisis. Artists such as Dorothea Lange were aided by having salaried work during the Depression. She captured what have become classic images of the dust storms and migrant families. Among her most well-known photographs is \"Destitute Pea Pickers in California. Mother of Seven Children\", which depicted a gaunt-looking woman, Florence Owens Thompson, holding three of her children. This picture expressed the struggles of people caught by the Dust Bowl and raised awareness in other parts of the country of its reach and human cost. Decades later, Thompson disliked the boundless circulation of the photo and resented the fact she did not receive any money from its broadcast. Thompson felt it gave her the perception as a Dust Bowl \"Okie.\"\n\n[5] Pea-pickers: During the Great Depression, the American government, without due process, deported between 1 and 2 million American citizens and legal residents of Mexican descent. This mass deportation, known as the Mexican Repatriation, took place from 1929 to 1939 and was empowered by panic of an alarming low unemployment rate sweeping over the United States at this time. The Dust Bowl was the name given to the Great Plains region devastated by drought in 1930s depression-ridden America. This triggered the migration of men, women and children seeking work, food and shelter making their way to California, hoping to find opportunity and a better life. Most of the migrants moving west were not farmers, having lived either in a town or city doing some kind of blue-collar work. They headed west unaware of the poor living conditions and only seasonal work that largely depended on the weather. The Midwesterners impacted by both the Depression and Dust Bowl packed up their families and relocated in hopes of finding a chance at the American dream, having realized that the drought and dust storms would not end anytime soon. Some sold what they could not bring along and began to drive west on Route 66. The term pea-picker was used to describe these particular group migrant workers in a negative context. The workers who picked these peas before the Dust Bowl migration and Mexican Repatriation had taken place were mostly Mexicans, Filipinos, and single white males before the Depression. This new\n\n[6] Dust Bowl: The work of independent artists was also influenced by the crises of the Dust Bowl and the Depression. Author John Steinbeck, wrote \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (1939) about migrant workers and farm families displaced by the Dust Bowl. Babb's own novel about the lives of the migrant workers, \"Whose Names Are Unknown\", was written in 1939 but was eclipsed and shelved in response to the success of the Steinbeck's work, and was finally published in 2004. Many of the songs of folk singer Woody Guthrie, such as those on his 1940 album \"Dust Bowl Ballads\", are about his experiences in the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression when he traveled with displaced farmers from Oklahoma to California and learned their traditional folk and blues songs, earning him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\".\n\n[7] Droughts in the United States: The Dust Bowl or the Dirty Thirties was a period of severe dust storms causing major ecological and agricultural damage to American and Canadian prairie lands from 1930 to 1936 (in some areas until 1940). The phenomenon was caused by severe drought coupled with decades of extensive farming without crop rotation, fallow fields, cover crops or other techniques to prevent erosion. Deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains had displaced the natural grasses that normally kept the soil in place and trapped moisture even during periods of drought and high winds.\n\n[8] Dust Bowl: Some of the failure to shift to more productive agricultural products may be related to ignorance about the benefits of changing land use. A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states. Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production. In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the beginning to change their crops.\n\n[9] Dust Bowl: The 2014 science fiction film \"Interstellar\" features a ravaged 21st-century America which is again scoured by dust storms (caused by a worldwide pathogen affecting all crops). Along with inspiration from the 1930s crisis, director Christopher Nolan features interviews from the 2012 documentary \"The Dust Bowl\" to draw further parallels.\n\n[10] History of Kansas: The Dust Bowl was a series of dust storms caused by a massive drought that began in 1930 and lasted until 1941. The effect of the drought was overshadowed by the plunging wheat prices and the financial crisis of the Great Depression. Many local banks were forced to close. Some farmers left the land but even larger numbers of unemployed men left the cities to return to their family's farm.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat caused the Dust Bowl?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

This qualification is a common proxy for determining how many low-income students a given school enrolls. The same survey found that half of all charter school students fall into categories that are classified as 'at risk'.\"\n\n[2] Charter School (Massachusetts): Charter schools operate with considerably more independence than traditional public schools. However, Massachusetts has two kinds of charter schools - Commonwealth Charters and Horace Mann Charters. Horace Mann charter schools differ from Commonwealth charter schools as they must be located within a school district. Both kinds of charter schools are free to structure their curriculum and school environment; for instance, many charter schools fit more instructional hours into a year by running longer school days and providing instruction on weekends and during the summer. Because few charter schools are unionized, they can hire and fire teachers and administrative staff without regard to the collectively bargained seniority and tenure provisions that constrain such decisions in most public schools. Although charter students made up only 2.9 percent of U.S. public school enrollment in 2008–2009, charter enrollment has grown rapidly and seems likely to accelerate in the near future. The growth of charter schools is an important component of the contemporary education reform movement's pursuit of accountability and flexibility in public education. Proponents see charter schools' freedom from regulation as a source of educational innovation, with the added benefit of providing a source of competition that may prompt innovation and improvement in the rest of the public system. At the same time, charter schools are controversial because, after a transition period in which the state provides subsidies, they receive a tuition payment for each enrolled student paid by students' home district\n\n[3] Gülen movement: The \"Wall Street Journal\" reported in 2016 that around 150 U.S. charter schools were tied to the Gülen movement, \"ranging from networks in Texas, Illinois and Florida to stand-alone academies in Maryland\". The \"Journal\" noted that like other charter schools \"blacks and Hispanics in underserved neighborhoods\" made up the majority of the student body, with common themes including \"an emphasis on math and science education, Turkish language classes and sponsored trips to Turkey\". Hendrick noted that in the upheaval following the 2016 Turkish coup attempt, proposed new charter schools and charters up for renewal \"that are run by Turkish-Americans and are said to be connected with the cleric\" could run into increased opposition, as the Turkish government has sought \"to bring down Mr. Gulen through U.S. charter schools they claim are connected to him\".\n\n[4] Charter School Institute: The Colorado Charter School Institute is an independent agency of the Colorado Department of Education and is the only independent, statewide charter school authorizer in the U.S. state of Colorado. The Colorado Charter School Institute authorizes 39 Colorado charter schools. The Colorado Charter School Institute is committed to creating and sustaining a portfolio of high-quality public school options that meet the needs of all students. Schools authorized by CSI have the autonomy to choose the educational methods that best meet the needs of their students, while being held accountable to clear expectations for performance. Learn more: https://www.csi.state.co.us/\n\n[5] School choice: Charter schools are independent public schools which are exempt from many of the state and local regulations which govern most public schools. These exemptions grant charter schools some autonomy and flexibility with decision-making, such as teacher union contracts, hiring, and curriculum. In return, charter schools are subject to stricter accountability on spending and academic performance. The majority of states (and the District of Columbia) have charter school laws, though they vary in how charter schools are approved. Minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the United States, City Academy High School, opened in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1992. The prevalence of charter schools has increased with the support of the Obama Administration. Under the Administration, the Department of Education has provided funding incentives to states and school districts that increase the number of charter schools.\n\n[6] Charter schools in the United States: Whether the charter school model can be scaled up to the size of a public noncharter school system has been questioned, when teaching demands more from teachers and many noncharter teachers are apparently unable to teach in the way charters seek, as has been suggested by Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, Diane Ravitch, education historian and former assistant U.S. education secretary, Mark Roosevelt, former schools chief for Pittsburgh, Penn., U.S., and Dave Levin, of the KIPP charters However, some, such as Eva Moskowitz of Success Academy Charter Schools, believe that the work is hard but performable and compensable and that the model can be scaled up.\n\n[7] Pacific Collegiate School: In 2006 PCS was named California Charter School of the Year by the Charter School Association. The class of 2006 includes 8 National Merit Finalists, and all of the students in this class were accepted at colleges. In 2006, PCS's AP World History program (directed by teacher Tara Firenzi) won an award for being the best AP World History program in the nation. PCS's music program, currently led by Heather Calame, has produced many high-ranking musicians, such as the LeBoeuf brothers, and continues to win recognition at the Anaheim music festival. PCS was named the #3 high school overall in the nation (behind Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, VA and Oxford Academy in Cypress, CA) and the #1 charter school in the nation in the December 4, 2009, issue of U.S. News & World Report. P.C.S was #8 in the nation and the 2nd Charter School (as of January 2013). Pacific Collegiate School was named a 2017 California Gold Ribbon School by the California Department of Education, and ranked by U.S. News & World Report as the 2017 Top Public School in California and the No. 10 Public School in the nation.\n\n[8] Charter school: According to the Education Commission of the States, \"charter schools are semi-autonomous public schools that receive public funds. They operate under a written contract with a state, district or other entity (referred to as an authorizer or sponsor). This contract - or charter - details how the school will be organized and managed, what students will be expected to achieve, and how success will be measured. Many charters are exempt from a variety of laws and regulations affecting other public schools if they continue to meet the terms of their charters.\" Minnesota wrote the first charter school law in the United States in 1991. , Minnesota had 165 registered charter schools, with over 41,000 students attending. The first of these to be approved, Bluffview Montessori School in Winona, Minnesota, opened in 1992. The first charter to operate was City Academy in St. Paul. Some specialized Minnesota charter-schools include the Metro Deaf School (1993), Community of Peace Academy (1995), and the Mainstreet School of Performing Arts (2004).\n\n[9] Charter schools in the United States: One study states that charter schools increase racial segregation. A UCLA report points out that most charter schools are located in African-American neighborhoods. However, a recent statistical analysis of racial segregation and performance outcomes in U.S. charter schools notes that studies on race and charter schools often incorrectly confound the inter-dependent variables of race and family income (poverty). Moreover, the authors conclude: \"charter schools with a strong academic focus and \"no-excuses\" philosophy that serve poor black students in urban areas stand as contradictions to the general association between school-level poverty and academic achievement. These very high-poverty, high-minority schools produce achievement gains that are substantially greater than the traditional public schools in the same catchment areas.\"\n\n[10] Charter schools in the United States: The U.S. Department of Education's 1997 First Year Report, part of a four-year national study on charters, was based on interviews of 225 charter schools in 10 states. The report found charters tended to be small (fewer than 200 students) and represented primarily new schools, though some schools had converted to charter status. Charter schools often tended to exist in urban locations, rather than rural. This study also found enormous variation among states.

The show stars Emily Rose, Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour. On April 9, 2013, Syfy renewed \"Haven\" for a fourth season of thirteen episodes, which premiered on September 2013. Production began on May 8, 2013 with the premiere picking up six months after the events of the season 3 finale. Former \"Eureka\" actor Colin Ferguson joined the cast as William, a stranger whose secret agenda leads him to Audrey. Emma Lahana and former \"Dexter\" actor Christian Camargo were cast in recurring roles as Jennifer Mason and Wade Crocker respectively.\n\n[2] Will Haven: Will Haven is a noise metal band from Sacramento, California. Formed in 1995, the group issued albums through many labels and have toured with acts such as Deftones and Soulfly before going on a hiatus in 2002. They would regroup in 2005 and continue to record and tour since. Throughout their history, they have issued 6 full-length albums (the latest being \"Muerte\" in 2018) as well as 2 EPs and a live DVD. Their musical style has been noted to be a combination of many metal and hardcore subgenres.\n\n[3] Jim Dunn (writer): Jim Dunn is a television writer and producer best known for working on shows such as \"The Dead Zone\", \"Crisis\" and \"Hand of God\". He frequently collaborates with his writing partner Sam Ernst. In 2010, he and Ernst co-created the Syfy supernatural drama series \"Haven\", based upon the Stephen King short story \"The Colorado Kid\". Haven ran for 6 broadcast cycles in over 80 countries, completing 78 episodes. Although Dunn and Ernst had moved on to other shows after Season 3, they returned to write a time-travel episode exploring Haven's past for the show's final season.\n\n[4] Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation): Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He described the episode as \"painful to watch\" and one that where \"all the worst sci-fi TV show clichés are in evidence\". He criticised the out of date sexist values of the plot in which Troi would have been forced to leave the ship to be with Wyatt. He did praise the appearance of Majel Barett, describing her as \"ever-radiant\" and the \"saving grace of the episode\". He gave it a score of three out of ten. Zack Handlen watched the episode for \"The A.V. Club\" in April 2010. He described Majel Barrett as \"agonizing\" and the episode was \"full of lazy shoulder shrugs and half-finished ideas\". He gave the episode a grade of D.\n\n[5] Haven (season 2): The second season of the American television series \"Haven\" premiered on July 15, 2011, on Syfy. The season consisted of 13 episodes including a Christmas episode. The show stars Emily Rose, Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour. On October 7, 2010, Syfy announced that \"Haven\" would begin production on a thirteen-episode second season to begin airing July 15, 2011. On March 22, 2011, SyFy announced that they would air a Christmas special of \"Haven\" during season two.\n\n[6] Haven (season 1): In the season's final episode, Max Hanson, who once lived in Haven, is paroled from Shawshank State Prison and returns to the town. Nathan then discovers that he is adopted and that the man is really his father. He also learns that his adoptive father, Chief Wuornos, has been struggling for decades to psychically hold the town of Haven together. When Garland's control over the town begins to fail, he is killed in one final effort to save Haven. Nathan is initially angry at Audrey for not offering the older man comfort, but he later apologizes and reveals he can feel her touch. Nathan is there when another \"Audrey Parker\" arrives at the close of the episode.\n\n[7] List of Haven episodes: \"Haven\" is a supernatural drama television series developed for television by Sam Ernst and Jim Dunn based on the 2005 Stephen King novel \"The Colorado Kid\". The one-hour drama premiered on July 9, 2010 on Syfy, and concluded on December 17, 2015. \"Haven\" tells the story of Audrey Parker (Emily Rose), an FBI Agent with no past and no family, who is sent to the small town of Haven, Maine to investigate the murder of an ex-convict. Partnering with local police officer Nathan Wuornos (Lucas Bryant), Audrey soon discovers that the small town is a safe-haven for people with supernatural abilities and that the town itself may have a shocking connection to her long-missing past. The series is the first property to be produced for Syfy channels around the globe, excluding Canada and Scandinavia.\n\n[8] Haven (season 5): Showrunner and executive producer Gabrielle Stanton explained that the team was already prepared for the end after they filmed both parts of the fifth season in 2014 when \"Haven\"s cancellation was announced in August 2015, but promised that the final episode would satisfy fans. She also said that they looked at the remaining thirteen episodes as if it is indeed the last because they didn't want to leave it on a giant cliffhanger just in case \"Haven\" isn't coming back. However, a year prior to the cancellation, season five being the show's last was first hinted by Eric Balfour when he told TVLine that one of the producers was considering about shooting two different endings at the time production was still filming.\n\n[9] Haven (Star Trek: The Next Generation): Several reviewers re-watched the episode after the end of the series. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in May 2007, saying that \"this could have been an absolutely dreadful 'shotgun wedding' episode that was as predictable as it was tedious, but Tracy's script, aided by very good guest star casting and great acting from everyone involved, made it one of the better episodes in season one.\" He gave the episode a grade of B. James Hunt for the website Den of Geek, watched the episode in November 2012. While he was mostly negative of the episode, saying that \"Troi episodes tend to test the patience of even the most devoted \"Trek\" fan\", he said that \"Haven\" marked the first time that the series would \"properly execute the idea that TNG episodes can have an A and B plot which dovetail nicely in the final act\".\n\n[10] Haven (season 3): The third season of the American television series \"Haven\" premiered September 21, 2012 and consisted a total of 13 episodes. The show stars Emily Rose, Lucas Bryant and Eric Balfour. On October 12, 2011, Syfy picked up \"Haven\" for a thirteen-episode third season expected to air in 2012, with production beginning on April 18. As the last two seasons ended with a cliffhanger, this season picked up where season two left off.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please answer the question based on the provided contexts.\n\nDo you know how many episodes Haven had?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nSOFTWARE:\nDeveloped by a team of expert AI engineers.

In the end they settled on using a similar method to how they choose eastern teams; they gave the top seed to the Big Ten Champion, Michigan State, then picked the best remaining team as the second semifinalist. While Michigan Tech had split its series with North Dakota during the season they finished with a worse record. Denver, on the other hand, ended with a stellar 22-5-1 mark and possessed the best offense in the country. There was, however, a problem. While most teams had a relatively balanced schedule, Denver had played only five of its 26 games on the road. Additionally, three of those game came against Colorado College. This meant that during the entire season Denver left their state only once and when they did they lost both game against North Dakota. Because of Denver's rather sizable home ice advantage their schedule was seen as far less strenuous than the Fighting Sioux's. In the end it may have been UND's 3–1 record against the Pioneers that tipped the scales in their favor but in any event North Dakota was awarded the second western seed, much to the displeasure of the Denver faithful.\n\n[2] 2017 SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's soccer team: The Saturday night MAC match at Northern Illinois was the 21st all-time meeting between the two schools, but it was their first conference game since both were members of the Big Central Soccer Conference in 1987–89. After a mostly evenly played first half, the Cougars fairly well outplayed the Huskies in the second, outshooting the hosts 10–6 and on-goal 3–1, but, as on Wednesday, they were unable to put the ball in the net. In the 74th minute, Gonzalez and NIU's Smith battled hard for the ball near mid-field. Gonzalez was whistled for a foul, but Smith shoved him, and the two got into a shoving match. While players and the referee separated the two, another Huskie hit Gonzalez from behind, apparently without being seen by the officials. Gonzalez and Smith were both red-carded and sent off. When coach Sanchez and the Cougar players argued that the other offending NIU player should also be penalized, the SIUE bench received a yellow card. Regulation time ended with the score tied 0–0. In the 98th minute, McHugh took a corner kick that Jambga headed into the net for the ninth game-winning goal of his career. With three saves, Dal Santo got his seventh shutout of the season.\n\n[3] 1961–62 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team: Prior to the start of the 1961 season, the ACC experienced a point shaving scandal. Four N.C. State players were accused of altering the score of several games and one UNC player was found to be involved with a gambler. As a result of this, the Dixie Classic was abolished and William Friday, the President of the University of North Carolina system, also de-emphasized basketball by allowing only sixteen regular season games. Therefore, Smith was limited to only two games against out of conference opponents. Smith kept the two most challenging opponents on the schedule, Notre Dame and Indiana, both games which would be played in North Carolina, one in Greensboro and the other in Charlotte, respectively.\n\n[4] United States Academic Decathlon: Like an athletic decathlon, the Academic Decathlon has ten events: art, economics, essay, interview, language and literature, math, music, science, social science, and speech. Prior to 2013, the Super Quiz replaced one of the seven objective events each year; from 2003-2012, it alternated between replacing science and social science. USAD releases the topics and theme of the following year's competition in early March, giving students time to prepare for a competition season that runs from November to April. The curriculum is developed by a ten-member panel of former USAD coaches known as the USAD Curriculum Advisory Group. The group contracts with \"curriculum developers\", who must have at least a bachelor's degree in their respective subject, to create the subject area outlines, \"Resource Guides\", and Notebook Dividers. The \"Super Quiz Resource Guide\" was formed mostly from articles from peer reviewed journals, but also includes non-peer reviewed articles, which are looked over by a panel of five reviewers and then checked for accuracy by another reviewer. Use of this format was continued for the Science packet in the 2012-2013 season.\n\n[5] Early mainframe games: \"Hamurabi\" in particular is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as \"The Sumer Game\". Dyment created it as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding their people, and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in \"101 BASIC Computer Games\" as \"Hamurabi\", and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. \"Hamurabi\" influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.\n\n[6] First Four: Although analysts' initial reactions to the concept were skeptical, the first game, played on March 13, 2001, was a success, and few complaints were lodged. The games are prominent by attracting viewers on nights in which no other NCAA games are played. Prior to the proposal of expansion, Syracuse University coach Jim Boeheim had advocated for an expansion of the tournament from 64 to 76 teams, which would include four opening round games for all of the 16th and also added opening round games for the 14th and 15th seeded teams. The expansion of play in games faced logistical challenges and lukewarm acceptance from NCAA President Myles Brand and the corporate and media partners of the NCAA. However, on April 22, 2010, the NCAA announced, as part of a new 14-year, US$10.8 billion agreement between CBS Sports and Time Warner's Turner Sports division, that the tournament will include three more play-in games, which would come to be known as the \"First Four.\"\n\n[7] Scholastic Scrimmage: The final episode was an hour in length. In the first season, there were three extended-length rounds. In seasons 2 and 3, there were four rounds in the game (and two Fast Track rounds to each team starting in the third season, the second pair being back-to-back after the third round; see below). The chime signaled completion of the first three rounds, and, as always, the downward buzzer ended the game. Seasons 4 and 5 saw the teams play 5 rounds, with a Fast Track after each of the first four rounds (see below).In seasons 1 through 3, the tournament used the following format: An opening round was played with all the teams. Then, additional qualifying matches were played with the lowest-scoring winners if there were more than 64 teams, or with the highest-scoring non-winners if there were less. Either way, this would result in a 32-team elimination tournament that continued until there were two teams left, who would play off in the hour-long special.\n\n[8] San Diego State Aztecs football: Coryell coached a total 12 seasons with the Aztecs, using the philosophy of recruiting only junior college players. There, he compiled a record of 104 wins, 19 losses and 2 ties including a total of three undefeated seasons in 1966, 1968, and 1969. His teams had winning streaks of 31 and 25 games, and won three bowl games during his tenure. It was at SDSC that Coryell began to emphasize a passing offense and he recounted, \"We could only recruit a limited number of runners and linemen against schools like USC and UCLA. And there were a lot of kids in southern California passing and catching the ball. There seemed to be a deeper supply of quarterbacks and receivers. And the passing game was also open to some new ideas. Coryell adds, \"Finally we decided it's crazy that we can win games by throwing the ball without the best personnel. So we threw the hell out of the ball and won some games. When we started doing that, we were like 55–5–1. John Madden served as Coryell's defensive assistant at SDSC. Madden had first met Coryell attending a coaching clinic on the I formation led by McKay. \"We'd go to these clinics, and afterward, everyone would run up to talk to McKay\", said Madden. \"Coryell was there because he introduced (McKay). I was thinking, \n\n[9] Rhode Island School for the Deaf: RISD started fielding boys' soccer team during the late 1970s and competed in RIIL-sanctioned games as well as New England Schools for the Deaf (NESD) tournaments. RISD won 12 NESD soccer tournaments from 1980 through 2002, all under the leadership of Gerard Dandeneau, a long time RISD employee. RISD also came out victorious in two International Friendship Tournaments, held at New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y. which was at the time, a major soccer tournament for deaf schools.\n\n[10] Gwent: The Witcher Card Game: The Homecoming Update, which was released in conjunction with \"Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales\", changed the game in a number of ways. The leader is no longer a playable card; it now gives the player an ability, and dictates how many mulligans are available to the player throughout the course of a match. The limits on how many gold and silver cards can be in a deck has been removed. Deckbuilding now uses a Recruit Cost system. Decks have a Recruit Cap of 165, with each card in the game having a Recruit Cost associated with it. The update also removed the siege row from the play area, leaving only the melee row and the ranged row. A new card type, artifacts, was added to the game. These do not contribute points to your side of the board but offer varying abilities.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the question and the contexts you have in mind, so I can answer your question more accurately.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "No, answer is not present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

His first goal came after just 43 seconds, making it the fastest away goal scored at Old Trafford in Premier League history. On 27 April, he scored City's first goal of a 2–0 defeat of Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, closing the gap on league leaders Liverpool to three points with a game in hand.\n\n[2] Christian Eriksen: Eriksen broke the record for the most goals scored by a Danish player in the Premier League when he scored his 33rd goal in a 3–2 win over West Ham United on 23 September 2017, surpassing the record previously held by Nicklas Bendtner. On 9 December, he made his 200th career appearance for Tottenham and marked the occasion by scoring in a 5–1 Premier League win over Stoke City. The following month, he scored his 50th goal for the club when he netted after just 11 seconds in the 2–0 league win over Manchester United. Eriksen's goal was the third-fastest goal ever scored in the Premier League era, bettered only by Alan Shearer and former Spurs captain Ledley King. On 17 March 2018, Eriksen scored twice in an FA Cup fixture against Swansea to send Spurs to the semi-final for the second season running. On 1 April 2018, Ericksen scored a 25-yard goal in the away match against Chelsea, helping Tottenham to their first win in 28 years at Stamford Bridge in a match that finished 3–1. Later that month, in the reverse fixture against Stoke, Eriksen scored twice to earn Tottenham a 2–1 win. Following the match, however, teammate Harry Kane, who was challenging for the season's Golden Boot award, claimed to have made the last touch on the ball for the second goal. Tottenham appealed to the Premier League panel who agreed that the ball touched Kane's shoulder and awarded him the goal. On 14 April,\n\n[3] List of footballers with 100 or more Premier League goals: During the 1995–96 season, Alan Shearer became the first player to score 100 Premier League goals, and holds the record for the fewest games taken to reach 100, doing so in 124 appearances. He also holds the record for most goals scored in the Premier League. After Shearer, Harry Kane is the second-fastest to 100 goals, doing so in 141 games.\n\n[4] 2013–14 Premier League: Two teams (Manchester City and Liverpool) scored more than 100 goals for the first time in league history. The feat had only once been achieved before – by Chelsea in 2009–10. Luis Suárez won the golden boot for most goals with 31, ahead of teammate Daniel Sturridge who came second with 21 goals. Wojciech Szczęsny of Arsenal and Petr Čech of Chelsea led the league with 16 clean sheets each. In a game against Southampton, Asmir Begović became just the fifth goalkeeper in league history to score. Begovic's goal was also the fastest of the season, occurring just 12 seconds into the game. Mile Jedinak had the most tackles with 133. Chelsea manager José Mourinho lost a home game for the first time in his Premier League career, losing to Sunderland and ending a run of 77-straight home games unbeaten, stretching over two stints as Chelsea manager.\n\n[5] Sammy Ameobi: His second goal for the club came two years after his first, scoring in a 2–0 victory over Morecambe in the League Cup. His brother Shola scored Newcastle's other goal, making the pair the first brothers to score in the same match in the club's history. Ameobi scored his first senior league goal for Newcastle on 26 October 2014, within eight seconds of the start of second half against Tottenham Hotspur. The goal was the fastest goal scored by a substitute from open play in the history of the Premier League.\n\n[6] Jermain Defoe: Defoe scored five goals at White Hart Lane in a 9–1 thrashing of Wigan on 22 November 2009. This included the second-fastest hat-trick in Premier League history, which was scored in seven minutes. In doing so, Defoe became only the third player to score five goals in one Premier League match, after Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. Dimitar Berbatov and Sergio Agüero have subsequently equalled this feat. After the match, Harry Redknapp further asserted his belief that Defoe would go on to be the Premier League's top scorer in 2009–10. Redknapp later said that although Wayne Rooney is the best all-round attacking player, Defoe is the best finisher in England and should be a regular for the English national team. On 3 February, Defoe claimed his third hat-trick of the season in an FA Cup fourth round replay against Leeds United at Elland Road, with Spurs winning 3–1. His rich vein of form continued on 21 February with another goal in the Premier League, against Wigan. Defoe's next goal was a penalty in Tottenham's win against Chelsea, which itself followed a famous 2–1 win over Arsenal. This took his tally to 24 goals for the season.\n\n[7] Mike Newell (footballer): Newell scored the 1,000th goal of the Premier League era during Blackburn's 3–1 win at Nottingham Forest in April 1993. Newell also held the record for the fastest hat-trick in Champions League history after scoring three goals in nine minutes for Blackburn against Rosenborg BK in the 1995–96 season, until this was broken in the 2011–12 season by Bafétimbi Gomis of Lyon with three in seven minutes. His hat-trick also made history as the first by an English player in the newly-branded UEFA Champions League since its transformation from the five-round knockout format of the original European Cup.\n\n[8] Leicester City F.C.: Striker Arthur Chandler is currently the club's all-time record goal scorer, netting 273 in his 12 years at the club; he also found the net in 8 consecutive matches in the 1924–25 season. The most goals managed in a single season for the club is 44 by Arthur Rowley, in the 1956–57 season. The fastest goal in the club's history was scored by Matty Fryatt, when he netted after just nine seconds against Preston North End in April 2006.\n\n[9] Romelu Lukaku: On 12 September 2016, Lukaku scored his first goals of the 2016–17 season with all three goals in a 3–0 against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light. His goals were scored in 11 minutes and 37 seconds, making it the 12th-fastest hat-trick in Premier League history. On 4 February 2017, Lukaku scored four goals, the first of which was Everton's fastest ever Premier League goal, against Bournemouth in a 6–3 victory at Goodison Park. It was also the 300th hat-trick scored in the Premier League. On 25 February 2017, he equalled Duncan Ferguson's club record for Premier League goals, scoring his 60th EPL goal for the Toffees in a 2–0 victory over Sunderland at Goodison Park. On 5 March, he surpassed Ferguson to become the outright record holder, scoring in a 3–2 loss against Tottenham Hotspur away at White Hart Lane. In the next match, a 3–0 home win against West Brom, Lukaku scored to become the first Everton player since Bob Latchford to score 20 or more goals in all competitions for three consecutive seasons. A week later, during a 4–0 victory over Hull City, he scored twice to take his league goals tally to 21 for the season, thereby becoming the first Everton player since Gary Lineker 31 years previously to surpass 20 league goals in a season, as well as being the fourth player and first foreign player to score\n\n[10] Mohamed Salah: On 26 November, Salah scored the opener and refused to celebrate in a 1–1 home draw with his former team Chelsea out of respect for the club as well as victims of the North Sinai Mosque attack two days earlier. Salah hit the top of the Premier League goal scoring charts by scoring twice after coming on as a substitute away at Stoke City on 29 November in a 3–0 win. The following month, Salah netted in a 4–0 win over AFC Bournemouth; a result which saw Liverpool become the first team in Premier League history to win four consecutive away league matches by a margin of at least three goals. In the process, he also became the joint-second fastest player to reach 20 goals for Liverpool on his 26th appearance, only behind George Allan who reached the milestone in 19 appearances in 1895.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWho scored the fastest goal in Premier League history after just 7.69 seconds?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It was contested between the Boston Bruins and the St. Louis Blues, who appeares in their third straight finals. The Bruins were making their first appearance in the finals since . The Bruins won the series, four games to none, their first Stanley Cup victory in 29 years. Bobby Orr scored the Cup-winning goal on Glenn Hall, with an assist from Derek Sanderson, at forty seconds of overtime, and the subsequent image of Orr flying through the air, his arms raised in victory — he had been tripped by Blues' defenseman Noel Picard immediately after scoring the goal — is one of the most famous and recognized hockey images of all time. With the win, the Bruins became the first American team to win the Stanley Cup since the Chicago Blackhawks in . As of 2018, this remains the Blues' last appearance in a Stanley Cup Final, who had went to the Finals in their first three years but lost each time in four-game sweeps.\n\n[2] 1993 Stanley Cup Finals: The 1993 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 1992–93 season, and the culmination of the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs. It was contested between the Los Angeles Kings and the Montreal Canadiens. It was the first appearance in the Final for the Kings and the first appearance since the 1920 Final for a team based on the west coast of the United States. . It was also the 34th and (as of 2018) most recent appearance for Montreal, their first since the 1989 Final. The Canadiens won the series four games to one to win the team's 24th Stanley Cup. The year 1993 was the 100th anniversary of the first awarding of the Stanley Cup in 1893, and the first Finals to start in the month of June. The 1993 Canadiens are also the last Stanley Cup championship team to be composed solely of North American-born players. To date, this is the last Stanley Cup finals won by a Canadian team.\n\n[3] 1949 Stanley Cup Finals: The Maple Leafs became the first NHL team to win the Cup in three straight seasons. The Leafs also won nine straight Finals games (beating Montreal in game six of the Finals, plus consecutive sweeps of the Wings in and this year). By defeating Detroit, Toronto won the Stanley Cup with a losing record. The only other team to win the Stanley Cup after finishing the regular season with a losing record was the Chicago Black Hawks, who qualified for the 1938 playoffs with a losing record and ultimately beat Toronto in the Cup Finals three games to one.\n\n[4] National Hockey League: The NHL replaced the NHA as one of the leagues that competed for the Stanley Cup, which was an interleague competition back then. Toronto won the first NHL title, and then defeated the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) for the 1918 Stanley Cup. The Canadiens won the league title in 1919; however their Stanley Cup Final against the PCHA's Seattle Metropolitans was abandoned as a result of the Spanish Flu epidemic. Montreal in 1924 won their first Stanley Cup as a member of the NHL. The Hamilton Tigers, won the regular season title in 1924–25 but refused to play in the championship series unless they were given a C$200 bonus. The league refused and declared the Canadiens the league champion after they defeated the Toronto St. Patricks (formerly the Arenas) in the semi-final. Montreal was then defeated by the Victoria Cougars of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) for the 1925 Stanley Cup. It was the last time a non-NHL team won the trophy, as the Stanley Cup became the \"de facto\" NHL championship in 1926 after the WCHL ceased operation.\n\n[5] 1967 Stanley Cup Finals: The 1967 Stanley Cup Finals was a best-of-seven series played between the Montreal Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs ended up winning the series, four games to two. In doing this, they won their thirteenth Stanley Cup. To date, this is Toronto's most recent Stanley Cup championship, most recent appearance in the championship final, and is tied for the longest-active championship drought in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues (who have never won since joining the NHL in 1967) at 50 (not including 2004–05 lockout) seasons. The 1967 Stanley Cup Final was also the last Stanley Cup Final in the Original Six Era.\n\n[6] 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs: The Presidents' Trophy-winning Pittsburgh Penguins, who had won the Stanley Cup the previous two years, were the favourite to repeat. However, both conferences saw numerous upsets as the third place team in every division reached their respective conference finals. This was the first time since the 1979 NHL-WHA merger that the Edmonton Oilers had missed the playoffs. It was also the first time that longtime Oilers and then-New York Rangers captain Mark Messier had missed the playoffs in his career. This was the only year between 1984 and 1994 that the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens did not face each other in the playoffs. This was the last time that the New York Islanders won a playoff round before 2016. This was also the most recent time that a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup.\n\n[7] Kenora Thistles: Donated in 1892 by Lord Stanley of Preston, the Governor General of Canada, the Stanley Cup was originally awarded to the top amateur team in Canada, who would then accept challenges from the winners of other leagues. From its inception until 1912, the Cup was nearly always won by teams from Montreal, Winnipeg, and Ottawa. In 1903 Ottawa won the Cup, after finishing the season tied for first in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League with the Montreal Victorias. They played a two-game, total-goal series for the league championship. The Montreal Hockey Club, who had held the Cup, finished third in the league and therefore lost the right to keep it.\n\n[8] History of the National Hockey League: The Original Six era was a period of dynasties. The Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup five times between 1944–45 and 1950–51. In the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals, the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime. Beginning in 1948–49, the Red Wings won seven consecutive regular season titles, a feat that no other team has accomplished. During that time, the Wings won four Stanley Cups. It was during the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals that the Legend of the Octopus was created. Brothers Pete and Jerry Cusimano brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia for the fourth game of the finals. They hoped that the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth game victory. Detroit went on to defeat Montreal 3–0 and the tradition was born. The Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956. Detroit won the first two match-ups, but Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup, ending one dynasty and starting another. The Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960, a feat no other team has duplicated. The Original Six era ended with the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals between the two-time defending champion Canadiens, and the Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs finished the era by winning the Cup four times between 1962 and 1967, their 1967 championship\n\n[9] 1995 Stanley Cup Finals: Despite the fact that the regular season was cut severely short by the owners' lockout, both the season and the finals were saved at the eleventh hour–this would be the latest in June that the Stanley Cup was awarded (matched in ). The Devils won their first Stanley Cup, after 21 seasons and two franchise relocations. It was also the first of three for the Devils in less than a decade. The win was made more impressive by the fact that the Devils won it holding the lowest seed ever to win the Stanley Cup with the fifth seed, which remained the record until , another Final which not only involved the Devils, but also saw the Stanley Cup won by a team that did not have home ice advantage in any of the four rounds of the playoffs, as the Devils lost to the Los Angeles Kings. Their regular-season winning percentage was also the lowest since the Toronto Maple Leafs. They were the underdogs going in, winning their first two games on the road.\n\n[10] Stanley Cup winning players: This is a complete alphabetic list of all players who won the Stanley Cup ice hockey trophy with years and total wins. The Stanley Cup was first awarded in 1893, and since 1926 it has been the championship trophy of the National Hockey League (NHL). The list includes all known players from each winning team from 1893 to 1923. Since 1924, all players whose names were actually engraved on the Stanley Cup are listed. The list also includes any player who qualified but whose name was not engraved on the Stanley Cup, and any player who did not qualify but who dressed in the playoffs\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nWho won the first Stanley Cup?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Fabric was put on the market on 1 June 2010. On 24 June it was announced Fabric was no longer in administration and had been bought by Fabric Life Limited, \"a consortium who fully back [Fabric] founders Keith Reilly and Cameron Leslie's vision.\"\n\n[2] Musa al-Qarni: \"\"What role do the verses of jihad and of fighting play in our lives? Do we only deal with part of the Koran in our lives, disregarding the rest, or are we enjoined to act according to the Koran in its entirety? Therefore, I now have the right to ask - and I’m directing this question first of all to myself and to anybody interested in Muslim affairs - what role do these verses play in our lives today? Where are the Al-Anfal verses? Where are the Baraa verses? The Battle of Badr was recounted in the Al-Anfal sura. What is their connection to our lives today? Do we recite these verses only in order to remind ourselves what happened to the Prophet and his companions, and then sever them from our lives and separate them from our lives completely?\n\n[3] Born of Fire: The commercial tells the contemporary history of the city of Detroit, through the use of narrative (provided by Rockford, Michigan resident Kevin Yon) and crisp images, while juxtaposing the grimness of the city against the portrayed luxury of the car. American rapper Eminem, who is from the Detroit area, drives the Chrysler 200 through the city to the Fox Theatre, passing by several neighborhoods and landmarks. Upon arriving, he walks inside the theater to the stage, where the Selected of God choir is singing. Eminem then walks on the stage and says to the camera, \"This is the Motor City, and this is what we do.\" An instrumental version of his song, \"Lose Yourself\", plays in the background throughout much of the ad, with the aforementioned choir providing additional source music. It was created by Wieden + Kennedy and has been voted by the public and the media as one of the greatest commercials of all time—including more than 17 million views and more than 50,000 likes on YouTube.\n\n[4] Holocaust denial: According to James Najarian, Holocaust deniers working for the Institute for Historical Review are not trained in history and \"put out sham scholarly articles in the mock-academic publication, the \"Journal of Historical Review\"\". They appeal to \"our objectivity, our sense of fair play, and our distrust of figurative language\". Thus, they rely on facts to grab the readers' attention. These facts, however, are strung by what Najarian calls \"fabricated decorum\" and are re-interpreted for their use. For example, they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers.\n\n[5] Fabric (club): Fabric is a nightclub in Farringdon, London, England. Founded in 1999, it was closed down by authorities in 2016. Fabric began a campaign to save the club on 16 September 2016. Fabric was later allowed to be reopened under strict laws.\n\n[6] Joe Fresh: As a believer in \"vertical retailing,\" Mimran typically oversees every stage in the Joe Fresh design, production, sales and marketing process – in contrast to the traditional retailer, who buys wholesale and marks-up in order to make a profit. The end result is a product line branded under its own label, sold in its own retail outlets, and priced without reference to wholesale margins. Managing all aspects of the process not only allows Mimran to be competitive on pricing but also innovative in terms of design and manufacture: In addition to peppy, nicely made, current-but-not-runway-slavish sportswear, there are avant-garde signature pieces. The jewel of the fall collection is a bell-shaped neoprene coat—in orange, naturally—inspired by a vintage Balenciaga, which will retail for $99. Balenciaga, he explains, was able to achieve antigravity shapes through the use of expensive, double-weave fabrics that aren’t available anymore. \"We first showed it in wool, but the wool wasn't really capturing the shape. So I thought, why don't we try neoprene?\" he says. \"It's like an art piece and sculptural and at the same time, it's so brand correct.\" According to Mimran, it's not only a matter of bringing more value to the end product, \"you're also bringing an idea, a thumbprint to the consumer.\"\n\n[7] The Life (advertisement): The Life, also known as We Are ODST is a television and cinema advertisement launched in 2009 by Microsoft to promote the first person shooter \"\" in the United States. The 150-second piece follows a young soldier through enlistment, training, and battle as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST), analogous to a paratrooper that drops from space to a battlefield. \"The Life\" was created by advertising agency T.A.G., an offshoot of McCann Erickson. Production of the commercial itself was handled by production company Morton/Jankel/Zander (MJZ). It was directed by Rupert Sanders, and post-production was conducted by Asylum. It was filmed in Hungary, just outside Budapest in a coal mine and abandoned factories to give the sequence an \"Eastern Bloc\" aesthetic. The commercial and its associated campaign proved hugely successful; on the week of its launch, \"Halo 3: ODST\" became the top-selling game for the Xbox 360 worldwide, and over 2.5 million copies were sold within the first few weeks of release. \"The Life\" went on to win a number of honours from the advertising and entertainment industries, including two Clio Awards, a London International Advertising Award and several honours from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry.\n\n[8] Life is Good Company: In 1989, brothers Bert and John Jacobs, who grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, designed their first T-shirts. They began selling their designs in the streets of Boston and out of an old van at colleges and street fairs along the East Coast of the United States. In 1994, following a not-so-successful road trip, they returned to Boston, unsure of the future of their business. It was their common practice to gather friends at their apartment following such trips to share stories and to ask their friends to comment on drawings and sayings posted on their living room walls. On this occasion, one drawing received considerable favorable attention from their friends — the head of a beret-wearing, smiling stick figure and the phrase \"Life is good.\" The brothers named the character Jake and printed up 48 shirts bearing a smiling Jake and the words \"Life is good.\" At a street fair in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the shirts sold out in less than an hour.{} The brothers began to sell T-shirts and hats featuring Jake in local stores. Sales grew quickly and they hit the $100 million sales mark by 2007. Life is Good expanded its product lines from T-shirts and caps in the early years to a full line of apparel for men, women, and children, as well as an increasing number of accessories categories. They offer over 900 different items in 14 categories. Products are sold online via the company's website, in approximately 4,500 retail stores in the United States\n\n[9] Lease of Life: Lease of Life is a 1954 British film drama made by Ealing Studios and directed by Charles Frend. The film was designed as a star-vehicle for Robert Donat, representing his return to the screen after an absence of over three years during which he had been battling the chronic asthma which plagued his life and career. It was a prestige production which was generally respectfully, if not over-enthusiastically, received and gained Donat a nomination as 'Best British Actor' at the 1955 British Academy Film Awards. In common with a number of other Ealing films of the era, \"Lease of Life\" focuses on a specific English milieu – in this case a Yorkshire village and its nearby cathedral city – and examines the nuances, quirks and foibles of its day-to-day life. The film is unique in the Ealing canon in having religion as its dominant theme.\n\n[10] Stephan Thiemonds: The cover of the English edition shows a hard hat held upside down. On its front, also wrong way up, the logo of the machinery and plant engineering company Buss SMS Canzler GmbH is depicted. As is usual in the international industry sector, the logo on the front serves to identify the wearer’s company affiliation. Within the basket-resembling, for individual head circumference adjustable plastic holder of the helmet rests the earth, similar to a breakfast egg in an egg cup. On the Earth, apart from the northern part of the African continent, Europe and the Arctic, an industrial plant is perceivable as an independent continent, consisting of fractionating columns, spherical gas tanks, pipelines and a gas flare stack. It seems as though the observer would cast a future glance into the crystal ball of a clairvoyant, whereas this future reveals itself as a growing, globally expanding industrial world. The angle measurement of 359° preceding the book title \"Workadays Life Of An Industrial Gypsy\" is meant to express that no man-made workmanship will ever achieve perfection (the geometric unit of a turn). The subheading\"You’ll Never Work Alone\" is borrowed in slightly altered form from the song text \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". While the \"walk\" within the song text stands for \"walking\" (together through life), the \"work\" in the subheading concerns the (occupational) \"work\" – as a reminder that nobody ever accomplishes a\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhat is the fabric of our lives?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [5].\n\nIn context [5], the question is answered with \"Fabric is a nightclub in Farringdon, London, England.

Joining it in the Superleague is another team from Pristina, RTV 21. Sigal Prishtina has dominated national basketball since 2002 by being crowned champions of the national Superleague 8 times (2001/02, 2002/03, 2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11), champions of Kosovo National Cup 11 times (2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2016) and one-time champion of the Supercup of Kosovo in 2005. Apart from indoor basketball success, Che Bar streetball team from Pristina has been crowned champion of the Streetball Kosovo national championship in 2013. This victory coincided with Streetball Kosovo's acceptance in the FIBA. Dardan Berisha from KB Sigal Prishtina was the best male athlete of 2013 according to Grupi Koha, following the success he had with the club throughout the season.\n\n[2] Education in Pristina: Primary and lower-secondary education was based on the 5 + 4 years model since the academic year 2004/05. In Pristina, in the same academic year, there were 60 primary and lower-secondary schools that provide instruction only in the Albanian language. The total number of students was 32,370 out of which 15,583 were females and all of them were Albanian students.The average number of students per class in that academic year in Pristina was 26.71. In the academic year 2005/06 the number of primary and lower-secondary schools increased in 63 and two (2) schools would now offer instruction in other languages as well; however, in 2007/08, this number again decreased in 61 schools with only one of them having mixed languages of instruction. These schools were attended by 34,703 Albanian, 32 Bosnian students, 30 Ashkali, 1 Roma and 199 Turkish students.\n\n[3] Education in Pristina: Among the first schools known in Pristina were those opened during the Ottoman period—that is before 1912. Albanians were allowed to attend these schools, most of which were religious, with only few of them being secular. During 1913, in Pristina, few Serbian-language primary schools and gymnasiums were opened. The period that followed the Ottoman rule, between 1916 and 1918 was also important for the educational system in Kosovo. During this period, Pristina, along with other municipalities such as Ferizaj and Prizren, was occupied by Bulgaria. Bulgarian occupier did not allow Albanian-language schools, however because of the positive impact of the Austro-Hungarians in the Bulgarian area, some religious catholic schools were allowed in Pristina and other municipalities occupied by them. In 1916, the Bulgarian National Gymnasium was opened in Pristina. The situation in terms of education was worse in the region under the rule of Bulgaria compared to the region occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces where 300 Albanian-language schools were allowed to be opened.\n\n[4] Pristina: In the early Ottoman era, Islam was an urban phenomenon and only spread slowly with increasing urbanization. The travel writer Evliya Celebi, visiting Pristina in the 1660s was impressed with its fine gardens and vineyards. In those years, Pristina was part of the Vıçıtırın Sanjak and its 2,000 families enjoyed the peace and stability of the Ottoman era. Economic life was controlled by the guild system (\"esnafs\") with the tanners' and bakers' guild controlling prices, limiting unfair competition and acting as banks for their members. Religious life was dominated by religious charitable organizations often building mosques or fountains and providing charity to the poor. During the Austrian-Turkish War in the late 17th century, Pristina citizens under the leadership of the Catholic Albanian priest Pjetër Bogdani pledged loyalty to the Austrian army and supplied troops. He contributed a force of 6,000 Albanian soldiers to the Austrian army which had arrived in Pristina. Under Austrian occupation, the Fatih Mosque (\"Mbretit Mosque\") was briefly converted to a Jesuit church. Following the Austrian defeat in January 1690, Pristina's inhabitants were left at the mercy of Ottoman and Tatar troops who took revenge against the local population as punishment for their co-operation with the Austrians. A French officer traveling to Pristina noted soon afterwards that \"Pristina looked impressive from a\n\n[5] Education in Pristina: During 1919-1939 in Yugoslavia, all Albanian-language schools were closed and education was allowed only in Serbo-Croatian. Around four (4) percent of Yugoslav people attended secondary education, with rural areas being the regions with the lowest numbers of participants since access to schools was almost nonexistent. During this period, the most marginalized group who was deprived from attending schools were girls coming from Muslim families. During the World War II Kosovo joined with Albania under Italian occupation. This marked a positive turn in the educational system in Kosovo and Prishtina/Pristina in particular since schools in Albanian language were allowed to be opened. Besides hundreds of primary schools opened in Pristina, the first high school in the Albanian language in this municipality, Sami Frasheri, was also founded. After the World War II, Kosovo was again part of Yugoslavia. During this period, ethnic Albanians were recognized as a national minority and Albanian language was accepted and Albanian-language primary schools were allowed while higher levels of education were offered still only in Serbo-Croatian. In 1968, the constitution was amended to allow the opening of Albanian-language schools at all levels. After the WWII, education in Kosovo was provided in three languages: Serbian, Albanian, and Turkish, while after 1953 lessons in these three languages were offered in the same school. After 1968, the foundation of Albanian-language educational institutions continued.\n\n[6] Politics in Pristina: The support for the LDK in Pristina was always in high numbers. Even after the support for the LDK in other parts of Kosovo decreased dramatically, its electorate in Pristina remained a stable amount. On the other hand, the support of voters for the PDK in other parts of Kosovo never reflected in the capital city. The PDK failed to end LDK dominance in Pristina, forcing the elections into a runoff just once, in 2007. In the 2007 elections PDK candidate Fatmir Limaj, a war veteran and famous politician, became the first and the last PDK candidate to enter the runoff race in which he was defeated by Isa Mustafa. In 2009 the AKR candidate, the businessman Vegim Gashi won 20 percent of the voters putting the AKR in the political scene of Pristina with a solid electorate. Pristina governed the city from 2007 to 2013, also being selected as the head of the LDK in 2010. However the support of the LDK in Pristina got to a crucial point when the dissatisfied voters voted massively for Shpend Ahmeti, the candidate of VETËVENDOSJE! therefore ending the LDK governance in Pristina for the first time. A turnaround during the last elections in Pristina was made when Pristina gathered around 2000 votes less in the second round, than a month earlier in the first round. Partia e Fortë was formed upon satirical premises in 2013 and its leader Visar Arif\n\n[7] Pristina: Islam and Christianity are the most widely practiced religions among the people of Pristina. In the 2011 census, 97.3% of the population of the city was counted as Muslim and 0.8% as Christian including 0.59% as Roman Catholic and 0.24% as Eastern Orthodox. The remaining 1.9% of the population reported having no religion, or another religion, or did not provided an adequate answer. Pristina has centres of worship for a multitude of faiths for its population. The Cathedral of Pristina is perhaps the largest cathedral in Kosovo and is named in honour of the Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary, Mother Teresa. Some of the mosques of Pristina, among others the Imperial Mosque and Çarshi Mosque, are centuries old and were built during the Middle Ages by the Ottomans.\n\n[8] Universiteti i Prishtinës: The University of Pristina occupies the campus in Pristina, Kosovo, serving as the major university in the area of Kosovo. It is a member of the European University Association. It maintains contacts with Western European and American universities and institutions. University of Pristina is the highest-ranked Albanian-language university in Europe. Universiteti i Prishtinës is a non-profit public higher education institution located in the urban setting of the medium-sized city of Pristina (population range of 500,000-1,000,000 inhabitants), Republic of Kosovo. This institution has also branch campuses in the following location(s): Gjilan, Pejë, Prizren, Ferizaj, Gjakovë, Mitrovicë. Officially accredited and/or recognized by the Ministria e Arsimit, e Shkencës dhe e Teknologjisë, Republika e Kosovës (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Kosovo Republic), the University of Pristina is a coeducational higher education institution. The University of Pristina offers courses and programs leading to officially recognized higher education degrees such as bachelor degrees, master degrees, doctorate degrees in several areas of study.\n\n[9] Media in Pristina: Television in Pristina has its beginnings on 26 November 1975, Radio Television of Pristina or RTP (Albanian: Radio Televizioni i Prishtinës, Serbian: Радио-телевизија Приштина, Radio-televizija Priština) was the first Albanian television channel in Kosovo, and it was part of JRT and had its building in Kosovo's capital Pristina (then a Yugoslav Autonomous Province). Both radio and television transmitted in Albanian, Serbian and Turkish language. Television discontinued transmission on 10 June 1999 and was relocated to Central Serbia, later it was dissolved. After the Kosovo war, material and buildings of Radio Television Pristina are under the administration of Radio Television of Kosovo,and have been established two other television RTV21 and KTV .\n\n[10] Bazaar of Pristina: Bazaar was the most important trade and crafts center. It was famous for its annual trade fairs and goat hide and hair articles. Most notable traders were Jews, who were relatively educated and besides their own language also spoke Turkish, Serbo-Croatian, and Albanian. Bazaar of Pristina was also visited by other traders, mostly by Ragusans (from nowadays Dubrovnik), who became a vast colony. Being in such crossroads, Bazaar served as a linkage of local and other foreign craftsmen.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the dominant language in Pristina?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "The question is: What is the dominant language in Pristina?\n\nThe answer is: Yes, the dominant language in Pristina is Albanian.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nIn context [1], the answer to the question \"What is the dominate language in Pristina?\" is present.

This was his rocking wing method of lateral control, which consisted of a secondary smaller wing mounted above the main wing on an A-frame that could pivot about its longitudinal axis. Watson's method of lateral control was applied by him in three different aeroplanes; the first was built in late 1909, the second in July 1910 and his third in 1913.\n\n[2] Preston Callison: In the state House, Callison served at times on the Education, Public Works, and Ways and Means committees. In 1965, in his first year in the state legislature, Callison ran in a special election to fill South Carolina's 2nd congressional district seat, which was based in the state capital, Columbia and included Callison's home in Lexington. The position opened when second-term Democrat Albert Watson switched his registration to Republican, resigned his seat, and ran for the remainder of his term as a member of the GOP. Watson changed parties because the House Democratic Caucus stripped him of his seniority for having supported the 1964 Republican presidential nominee, Barry Goldwater of Arizona, rather than U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Watson said that he would not \"sit back and be bullied and browbeaten by the northern liberals.\"\n\n[3] Preston Watson: What actually happened to cause the Caudron to crash has never been fully explained; some hypothesised that the aircraft suffered structural failure, since a wing was found in an adjoining field. Engine failure was also suggested as a possible cause of the crash. Watson's RNAS casualty card offers no clues, merely stating the time and place he was killed. Buried on 5 July 1915 in Dundee's Western Cemetery, he was survived by a widow and two young children. What became of his aeroplanes and his research is not known.\n\n[4] Preston Watson: Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum and professional aviation researcher Charles Gibbs-Smith vigorously investigated the Watson claim. The presentation of Gibbs-Smith's findings to him eventually forced a change of tack from Watson the Younger. Published in the December 1955 issue of Aeronautics magazine titled A pioneer in Scotland, James changed his story from that published in the same magazine previously, stating that \"Preston's first aeroplane was without an engine\" and that \"trial flights were made at Errol in the summer of 1903\". In a letter to Gibbs-Smith, James also wrote, \"I make no claim that the 'machine' Preston used at Errol in 1903 was a powered machine.\"\n\n[5] Preston Watson: Although clearly a typographical error with regards to the location of \"the secluded little village of Forgendenny, Perthshire, near Preston\" and Watson’s name, this article seems to confirm a likely completion time period of his first full size aeroplane based on his rocking wing patent.\n\n[6] Kirk Watson: Kirk Preston Watson (born March 18, 1958) is an American attorney and Democratic politician from the capital city of Austin, Texas. He served as Austin mayor from 1997 to 2001. He ran unsuccessfully for Texas Attorney General in the 2002 election, when he was defeated by the Republican Greg Abbott, later governor of Texas. In 2006, Watson was elected to the Texas State Senate from District 14.\n\n[7] Preston Watson: Preston Watson is interred at Western Cemetery (on the Perth Road) in Dundee.\n\n[8] Preston Watson: Preston Watson's achievements have been clouded by erroneous claims of powered flight before the Wright Brothers. This originated from his younger brother James Watson, who brought to the public's greater attention in an article published in the Manchester Guardian newspaper in December 1953. There was an article in The Scots magazine in October 1953 released by one J.D. Leslie, but it is dismissed owing to inaccuracies. Since then, Preston's name has been associated with this false claim and his actual work in promoting aviation is often overlooked.\n\n[9] Preston Watson: On 16 March 1915, Watson gained his Royal Aero Club Certificate No. 1,117 (equivalent of a pilot's licence) with the London and Provincial School at the London Aerodrome, Hendon, having sought a commission with the Royal Naval Air Service with the outbreak of war in 1914. Sadly, on 30 June 1915 he lost his life when the Caudron G.3 aeroplane he was flying disintegrated in flight and crashed in Dunlye field, a few miles from the Cross-in-Hand Hotel, Sussex. Watson is buried in Dundee's Western Cemetery.\n\n[10] Preston Watson: This claim has been repeatedly proven to be false but the myth frequently reappears in Scottish newspaper articles and most recently in a book published in 2014 with the support of the Dundee Museum of Transport titled The Pioneer Flying Achievements of Preston Watson by Alistair W. Blair and Alistair Smith. Born in Dundee, Tayside, Scotland on 17 May 1880, the son of Mr Thomas Watson of Balgowan and his wife Jane, Preston Albert Watson was a pupil of the High School of Dundee and showed considerable interest in things mechanical from an early age. Young Preston possessed an analytical mind, and quite often, he, according to the Sunday, 27 October 1984 edition of The Courier and Advertiser newspaper;\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nPlease note that the answer is based on the information provided in the contexts.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhy is heavy metal called heavy metal?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Motörhead: Although Motörhead is often considered a heavy metal band, Lemmy always described Motörhead's music as simply \"rock and roll\". In 2011, he said: \"We were not heavy metal. We were a rock 'n' roll band. Still are. Everyone always describes us as heavy metal even when I tell them otherwise. Why won't people listen?\" In 2014, he reiterated to \"Der Spiegel\" that he did not particularly like heavy metal.\n\n[2] Heavy metal music: The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, \"Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates ... a party without limits ... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic.\" Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are \"clearly misguided\" as these critics have \"overlook[ed] the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise\". Music critic Robert Christgau called metal \"an expressive mode [that] it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat\".\n\n[3] Heavy metals: Physical and chemical characterisations of heavy metals need to be treated with caution, as the metals involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy metals tend to be less reactive than lighter metals and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy metals, such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter metals, and, lighter metals such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier metals.\n\n[4] Toxic heavy metal: Heavy metals enter plant, animal and human tissues via air inhalation, diet and manual handling. Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of airborne contaminants including arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, vanadium, zinc, platinum, palladium and rhodium. Water sources (groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers) can be polluted by heavy metals leaching from industrial and consumer waste; acid rain can exacerbate this process by releasing heavy metals trapped in soils. Plants are exposed to heavy metals through the uptake of water; animals eat these plants; ingestion of plant- and animal-based foods are the largest sources of heavy metals in humans. Absorption through skin contact, for example from contact with soil, or metal containing toys and jewelry, is another potential source of heavy metal contamination. Toxic heavy metals can bioaccumulate in organisms as they are hard to metabolize.\n\n[5] Heavy metals: An early use of the term \"heavy metal\" dates from 1817, when the German chemist Leopold Gmelin divided the elements into nonmetals, light metals, and heavy metals. Light metals had densities of 0.860–5.0 g/cm; heavy metals 5.308–22.000. The term later became associated with elements of high atomic weight or high atomic number. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"heavy element\". For example, in discussing the history of nuclear chemistry, Magee notes that the actinides were once thought to represent a new heavy element transition group whereas Seaborg and co-workers \"favoured ... a heavy metal rare-earth like series ...\". In astronomy, however, a heavy element is any element heavier than hydrogen and helium.\n\n[6] Nu metal: In addition to criticizing nu metal, many heavy metal musicians and fans of heavy metal music have rejected nu metal as a legitimate subgenre of heavy metal, saying it is not \"true heavy metal\". Some nu metal musicians have tried to distance themselves from being heavy metal at all. For example, Korn's Jonathan Davis rejected the \"heavy metal\" label. When talking with \"Vice\", Davis spoke about Korn being called a heavy metal band, saying, \"I never thought of us to be metal to begin with. Yeah, we're heavy and downtuned, but metal, to me, is like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. That's metal, man. I always thought of us as a funk band. That funky, groovy shit.\" Godsmack's vocalist Sully Erna also rejected the \"heavy metal\" label and said he views Godsmack as a hard rock band. Though he was originally more tolerant of the concept, Linkin Park's vocalist Chester Bennington later expressed some disagreement with his band being labeled a heavy metal group because he felt the term limited the scope of the band's actual style. He elaborated:\n\n[7] Priestess (band): The band have been variously labeled as hard rock, heavy metal, and even stoner rock, although the band do not try to define their style; Heppner once commented that \"all labels beyond rock are useless to [him],\" and also pointed out in 2005 that Cream were considered metal for their time, concluding that \"in this ancient way, [Priestess are] metal.\" Other bands that have influenced the group were also referred to as heavy metal in bygone decades. Watchorn only describes the band as hard rock, and argues that calling their music \"metal\" only limits the band's creative freedom. Drummer Vince Nudo has said that since the songs are not written to be \"heavy\", he does not understand the direct metal association. The band have opined that they are perhaps not \"heavy\" enough for heavy metal fans while they are too \"heavy\" for fans of softer rock, and have also denied that the music scene of Montreal has in any way defined, shaped, or helped them find their sound; Heppner once said, \"We might as well be from anywhere,\" and the band are close friends with fellow Montreal acts. The band's name itself has been part of the confusion; Heppner, speaking English during an interview with Canadian French-language newspaper \"La Presse\", stated that Priestess was \"just this heavy name\" and the reporter wrote, \"parce que ça sonne metal\" (which translates to \"because it sounds metal\").\n\n[8] Heavy metal lyrics: A study indicated that heavy metal is a positive influence on smart children and teens; it was called \"a comfort for the bright child\". As well, the study showed that \"...intelligent teenagers often listen to heavy metal music to cope with the pressures\" of being smart. The study found that metal listening is \"not\" associated with delinquency and poor academic achievement. The study indicated that teen metal listeners use metal to \"...help them deal with the stresses and strains of being gifted\" (highly intelligent), as it acts as a \"cathartic\" to enable the teens to deal with alienation and \"purge...negativity\".\n\n[9] Heavy metal music: As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as \"heavy metal\" or simply as \"hard rock\". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with \"High Voltage\" in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 \"Rolling Stone\" encyclopedia entry begins, \"Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC\". Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, \"Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today. ... [They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal\". The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band \"became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition\".\n\n[10] Deena Weinstein: Weinstein holds a PhD from Purdue University. She argues that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture. Her 1991 book \"Heavy Metal: A Cultural Sociology\" \"describes the heavy metal music culture, explains why it has prompted demands for censorship, and argues that the music deserves tolerance and respect.\" A review of the book calls it: A reasonable summary of most academic study so far, which indulges heavy metal as an extreme offshoot of rock in which rebellion is the prime goal and the fundamental ceremony is the live concert. These failings aside, there is very perceptive research here on the origins of heavy metal and the personalities within its culture. The latter is most informative of all aspects in this book and is Weinstein's strength as a writer.The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called her book \"Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture\" the definitive study of heavy metal culture, saying that it \"does for metal what Greil Marcus's \"\" did for the Sex Pistols.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWhy is heavy metal called heavy metal?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

He grew up in Breslau and was greatly inspired by his father to study science and to be an active Zionist. He studied medicine from 1927-1933 in the universities of Breslau, Freiburg and Berlin. Although he passed the Medical Board examination in 1933, and would have started work in a hospital in Berlin and in the Jewish hospital in Breslau, he was prohibited from practicing by the Nazi regime which came to power that same year. Together with his wife Ruth Aber Steinitz (1907-1995), a medical student as well, he left Germany in 1933 and immigrated to Palestine.\n\n[2] Heinz Steinitz: Steinitz received support and collaboration for his initiative from colleagues at other Israeli universities and research institutions, from the Israel Oceanographic and Limnology Research (IOLR) and from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The vision of Walter Steinitz was ultimately realized in 1968, five years after he died, when the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) of The Hebrew University near Eilat was inaugurated. Launching the laboratory was a peak in the career of Heinz Steinitz as an Israeli zoologist and as an internationally recognized senior marine biologist. He died in 1971 while being the first director of the laboratory; in his honor, the laboratory was renamed The Heinz Steinitz Marine Biology Laboratory.\n\n[3] Heinz Steinitz: Heinz Steinitz (April 26, 1909 – April 28, 1971, ) was a senior Israeli marine biologist and herpetologist, Professor and Chairman of the Department of zoology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He laid the foundation for research and teaching in marine biology and oceanography in Israel. In 1968 he founded the Marine Biology Laboratory of the Hebrew University near Eilat, serving as its first director. He also served as a founding member of the Zoological Society of Israel and a co-founder of the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel.\n\n[4] Heinz Steinitz: Unable to get in 1933 a permit from the British administration in Palestine to practice as a physician, Heinz Steinitz turned to earn his living in an agricultural research station located in Rehovot (and later in Petah Tikva). That work marked the moment he changed his path from medicine to zoology. His research on the control of citrus pests, under the supervision of Prof. F. S. Bodenheimer, eventually became the experimental basis for his doctoral thesis. In 1938, Steinitz was the first to obtain a Ph.D. degree in zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and he took his place in the founders and pioneers of zoology in Israel.\n\n[5] Heinz Steinitz: The fish collection of the Hebrew University was begun in the 1920s by Prof. Israel Aharoni and Prof. Georg Haas, soon after the opening of the Department of Zoology. Steinitz added specimens from the very beginning of his work in the department. During the 1950s, the collection of fish specimens was carried out also by Prof. Adam Ben-Tuvia from the Sea Fishery Research Station in Haifa, a former student of Steinitz. A considerable augmentation of the collection occurred with the harvest of the expeditions to Sinai in 1956 and the Israeli South Red Sea Expeditions in the 1960s, when over 3,000 lots of fish were deposited. The taxonomic and zoogeographic identification of specimens was often conducted by correspondence between Steinitz and ichthyologists and curators of research institutes and science museums around the world. As a consequence, the collection became recognized as having major international importance, serving as a reference collection for the international community of ichthyologists.\n\n[6] Heinz Steinitz: Doctor Walter Steinitz, father of Heinz Steinitz, published in 1919 his vision and proposal to establish a marine biology research station on the Mediterranean coast of Palestine. The Hebrew University, and scholars in Palestine and in other countries, supported the plans of the project, but attempts to raise funds for it failed. Inspired by his father's vision, Heinz Steinitz resumed the effort to carry out the concept. However, he decided in the 1950s that the station would be better situated if it were built on the coast of the Red Sea, in the Gulf of Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba). He had three reasons for this preferred location: (a) Being by that time knowledgeable about the marine life in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, Heinz Steinitz recognized the higher richness and the notable biodiversity of the latter, which still remained widely uninvestigated. (b) First reports about the presence of fishes of Indo-Pacific origin in the eastern Mediterranean Sea began to appear in the beginning of the twentieth century. Indo-Pacific fishes were also observed along the coast of Palestine for the first time by Walter Steinitz. The findings were indicative for intrusion of alien fishes into the eastern Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal that was constructed and opened only several decades prior to those first observations. Heinz Steinitz believed that a research base in the Golf of Eilat would be best placed to conduct \n\n[7] Walter Steinitz: His three sons were born, grew up and studied in Germany before they emigrated to Palestine. He inspired them to study sciences: Ernst Steinitz (1907-1980), was an internist in the private sector; Heinz Steinitz (1909-1971) was a professor of zoology and marine biology in the Department of Zoology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; and Gideon Steinitz (1911-1975) was a mathematician in his academic education, became a meteorologist in Palestine and eventually was head of the Israel Meteorology Service.\n\n[8] Heinz Steinitz: Three sons were born to Heinz Steinitz and Dr. Ruth Steinitz. Each turned to sciences: Raphael Steinitz, an astrophysicist, is a Professor Emeritus at the Department of Physics, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be’er Sheba; Gideon Steinitz, a senior geologist, was the former Head of the Geological Survey of Israel, Jerusalem; and Benjamin Steinitz, a plant scientist retired as a senior research scientist in the fields of plant physiology and horticulture at the Institute of Plant Sciences, Agricultural Research Organization, The Volcani Center, Rishon LeZion.\n\n[9] Heinz Steinitz: Heinz Steinitz was an ichthyologist, herpetologist, and marine biologist. He researched the ecology, distribution and evolution of amphibians and fresh water fish in the Middle East; the ecology, distribution and taxonomy of fish in the Red Sea; the ecology of the southeast Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. Other research interests included experimental embryology, neurohistology, and anatomical microscopy of the amphibian eye. Geographically, his studies were conducted along the Syrian-African Great Rift valley, from Lake Hula and Lake Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee) in the north of Israel, through the Dead Sea in the center of the country, down to the Gulf of Eilat and the Red Sea in the south. Other parts of his work were carried out in the south east Mediterranean Basin and along the coasts of the Sinai Peninsula. His research concerned taxonomy, anatomy, zoogeographic distribution and ecology of the fauna investigated.\n\n[10] Heinz Steinitz: Steinitz supervised masters and doctoral students, some of whom became senior scientists in fields of biology and environmental sciences in universities, research institutes, colleges and teacher colleges around the country. He believed in the importance of teaching and education at all levels, including preparing students to be school teachers. In this context, in the years 1957-1960 he was board member of the School of Education of the Hebrew University.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [2].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating).

It was actually a decision made by the film's distributor, Focus Features, to campaign Vikander for the Oscar and all other prizes in the supporting actress category, in which many lead actresses have been nominated and even won. She was intentionally not shortlisted in the best actress category as she would have been competing against Brie Larson for her role in \"Room\", which would have decreased her chances of winning while the supporting actress category had little competition. At both the Golden Globe Awards and the British Academy Awards, Vikander's performance in \"The Danish Girl\" was nominated for Best Actress and she was included in the Best Supporting Actress category for her work in \"Ex Machina\".The film has been banned in Qatar on grounds of moral depravity, and also in the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, and Malaysia.\n\n[2] Maggie Smith: On screen, Smith first drew praise for the crime film \"Nowhere to Go\" (1958), for which she received her first BAFTA Award nomination.

With eleven awards, \"Titanic\" tied with \"Ben-Hur\" for the most Academy Awards in Oscar history. It also became the first film to win Best Picture without a screenwriting nomination since 1965's \"The Sound of Music\".

Despite the expense, it is highly valued for its flavor, which author Frederic Rosengarten Jr. described in \"The Book of Spices\" as \"pure, spicy, and delicate\" and its complex floral aroma depicted as a \"peculiar bouquet.\" Despite its high cost, vanilla is widely used in both commercial and domestic baking, perfume manufacture and aromatherapy.\n\n[2] Cardamom production: Cardamom production employs plants of the genera \"Elettaria\" and \"Amomum\" in the ginger family Zingiberaceae. Cultivation of cardamom was introduced to Guatemala before World War I by Oscar Majus Kloeffer; today Guatemala is the world's biggest producer and exporter, followed by India and Sri Lanka; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are the leading importers of the spice. After saffron and vanilla, cardamom is the third most expensive spice by weight.\n\n[3] Birkin bag: \"The Philippine Star\" reported in March 2013, that a very high-end, 30-cm Shiny Rouge H Porosus Crocodile Birkin with 18K gold fittings and encrusted with diamonds fetched US$203,150 at an auction in Dallas, Texas. A 30 centimeter matte white Himalaya niloticus crocodile Birkin with 18-carat white gold and hardware bearing 245 diamonds was sold at a Christie's auction in Hong Kong for HK$2.94 million (US$377,261), creating a new record for the most expensive handbag in the world. A similar one had been sold by Christie's in spring 2016 for a then-world-record price of HK$2.33 million (US$300,000).\n\n[4] Brit Awards: Ginger Spice, Geri Halliwell, wore a Union Jack dress. Spicemania was at its height in the UK and the Spice Girls had just cracked the US as well, reaching number 1 with their debut single and album. Halliwell was originally going to wear an all-black dress, but she thought it was too boring so her sister sewed on a Union Jack tea towel, with a 'peace' sign on the back. The now iconic red, white and blue mini-dress was worn during the Spice Girls' performance of their number one song \"Who Do You Think You Are\". In 1998 she sold her dress in a charity auction to Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for a record £41,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold. This performance won the award for \"BRITs Hits 30 – Best Live Performance at The BRIT Awards\" at the 2010 BRIT Awards.\n\n[5] Incense offering in rabbinic literature: The first four spices (aromatic gum resin, operculum, galbanum and frankincense) comprised the greatest weight. Each consisted of seventy \"maneh\"-weight, for a combined weight of 280. After each spice was pounded separately, they were mixed together. To these were added myrrh, cassia, spikenard (valerian) and saffron, each consisting of sixteen \"maneh\"-weight for a total weight of sixty-four \"maneh\"s. These, too, were pounded separately before being mixed together. The combined weight now came to 344, although the first four spices were, in weight, more than the last four spices by a ratio of about 4 1/3 to 1. Costus was added unto these, being only twelve \"maneh\"-weight. The previous four spices mentioned were, in weight, more than the costus by a ratio of 1 1/3 to 1. The combined weight now came to 356. Unto these spices was added cinnamon; three \"maneh\"-weight. The previous spice named was, in weight, more than the cinnamon by a ratio of 4 to 1. The combined weight now came to 359. Finally, unto these spices was added nine \"maneh\"-weight of agarwood, which last spice was also more in weight than the cinnamon by a ratio of 3 to 1. The entire weight accruing therefrom was three-hundred and sixty-eight \"maneh\n\n[6] Dartz: Dartz's \"Prombron\" Monaco Red Diamond Edition was shown at the 2010 Top Marques in Monaco, with an expected price of €1,000,000 ($1.25 million), it would become the world's most expensive SUV. The features included white gold-ruby encrusted embedded badges as well as gold-plated, bullet-proof windows, an exhaust system made out of tungsten, diamond-ruby encrustedgauges, a Kevlar exterior coating, and leather made out of whale penises, though the latter was dropped. It also comes with three bottles of the world's most expensive vodka, \"RussoBaltique\".\n\n[7] Cardamom: Cardamom is the world's third-most expensive spice, surpassed in price per weight only by vanilla and saffron.\n\n[8] Moonshine by country: \"Samogon\" is one of the most popular alcoholic beverages in the country. It directly competes with vodka, which is more expensive (in part due to taxes on distilled alcohol), but contains fewer impurities. A 2002 study found that, among rural households in central Russia, \"samogon\" was the most common alcoholic beverage, its per capita consumption exceeding the consumption of vodka 4.8 to 1. The study estimated that, at the time, it was 4 to 5 times cheaper to manufacture homemade \"samogon\" from sugar than to buy an equivalent quantity of vodka. Since then, the price of vodka has been rising above the rate of inflation. As of 2011, typical cost of production of homemade \"samogon\" is on the order of 30 rubles (approx. 1 USD) per liter, mainly determined by the price of sugar. The breakeven cost of \"economy-class\" vodka is 100 rubles/liter, but federal taxes raise retail prices almost threefold, to 280 rubles/liter. Possibly due to rising taxes, per capita consumption of vodka in Russia has been falling since 2004. It has been largely replaced with \"samogon\" among marginal classes. Some analysts forecast that the trend will result in increased adoption of \"samogon\" among the middle class, and by 2014, \"samogon\" will overtake vodka as the most common alcoholic beverage nationwide.\n\n[9] Trade and use of saffron: Saffron is a key seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine in use for over three millennia. One of the world's most expensive spices by weight, saffron consists of stigmas plucked from the vegetatively propagated and sterile \"Crocus sativus\", known popularly as the saffron crocus. The resulting dried \"threads\" are distinguished by their bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes. The saffron crocus is unknown in the wild; its most likely precursor, \"Crocus cartwrightianus\", originated in Crete or Central Asia; The saffron crocus is native to Southwest Asia and was first cultivated in what is now Greece.\n\n[10] Spice: Spices were among the most demanded and expensive products available in Europe in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. Given medieval medicine's main theory of humorism, spices and herbs were indispensable to balance \"humors\" in food, a daily basis for good health at a time of recurrent pandemics. In addition to being desired by those using medieval medicine, the European elite also craved spices in the Middle Ages. An example of the European aristocracy's demand for spice comes from the King of Aragon, who invested substantial resources into bringing back spices to Spain in the 12th century. He was specifically looking for spices to put in wine, and was not alone among European monarchs at the time to have such a desire for spice.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhat is Russia's most expensive spice by weight?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It is attributed with being one of the first fully online payroll providers and has offices throughout the U.S. It has also been recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the fastest-growing publicly traded companies in the world and Forbes' magazine ranked it one of the top five fastest-growing publicly traded technology companies in its Fast Tech rankings. Founded in 1998, it reported annual revenue of $433.0 million for 2017, up from $329.1 million for 2016.\n\n[9] Kanata, Ontario: Kanata () is one of the largest suburbs of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is about west of the city's downtown. As of 2016, Kanata had a population of 90,806 (117,304 in the population centre) and is growing rapidly. Before it was amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001, it was one of the fastest growing cities in Canada and the fastest growing community in Eastern Ontario. Located just to the west of the National Capital Commission Greenbelt, it is one of the largest of several communities that surround central Ottawa. It is a planned community and an important high tech centre.\n\n[10] Smart city: Major technological, economic and environmental changes have generated interest in smart cities, including climate change, economic restructuring, the move to online retail and entertainment, ageing populations, urban population growth and pressures on public finances. The European Union (EU) has devoted constant efforts to devising a strategy for achieving 'smart' urban growth for its metropolitan city-regions. The EU has developed a range of programmes under 'Europe's Digital Agenda\". In 2010, it highlighted its focus on strengthening innovation and investment in ICT services for the purpose of improving public services and quality of life. Arup estimates that the global market for smart urban services will be $400 billion per annum by 2020. Examples of Smart City technologies and programs have been implemented in Singapore, Dubai, Milton Keynes, Southampton, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, China and New York.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhich city has the world's fastest-growing mature tech ecosystem since 2016?\n\nPlease answer with a \"Yes\" or \"I don", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

First was the real-life murderer Ed Gein, about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\", in 1962. (The story can be found in \"Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3\"). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of Lin Carter) and Chris Steinbrunner, as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of \"Castle of Frankenstein\".\n\n[2] Psycho (franchise): In 1959, the novel \"Psycho\" was published. The novel was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal Ed Gein. Author Robert Bloch lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of Norman Bates was very different in the novel from in the film version. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When Joseph Stefano adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable. In 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called \"Psycho II\" which had nothing to do with the 1983 film version. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film. In 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company Bloch wrote a third novel called \"Psycho House\". However, according to horror writer David J. Schow, when writing it Bloch originally called it \"Psycho 13\". In the novel, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as tourist attractions and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n[3] Psycho (1960 film): The screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel, with a few notable adaptations by Hitchcock and Stefano. Stefano found the character of Norman Bates—who, in the book, is middle-aged, overweight, and more overtly unstable—unsympathetic, but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins. Stefano eliminated Bates' drinking, which evidently necessitated removing Bates' \"becoming\" the Mother personality when in a drunken stupor. Also gone is Bates' interest in spiritualism, the occult and pornography. Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in Marion's life and not introduce Bates at all until 20 minutes into the film, rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does. Indeed, writer Joseph W. Smith notes that, \"Her story occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative\". He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion's murder. When Lila Crane is looking through Norman's room in the film she opens a book with a blank cover whose contents are unseen; in the novel these\n\n[4] Norma Bates (Psycho): Norma Bates is a main character in the A&E psychological horror drama television series \"Bates Motel\", a contemporary prequel to the 1960 film \"Psycho\", set in the present day. Norma is portrayed in the series by Vera Farmiga. She is extremely possessive and protective of her son Norman and does everything she can to keep him to herself. This, along with several other traumas Norman suffered as a child, results in his developing an alternate personality, \"Mother\", who kills anyone whom she believes poses a threat to him or gets in the way of their relationship.\n\n[5] Psycho (franchise): With the financial failure of \"Psycho III\", Universal decided to continue the \"Psycho\" franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the \"Friday the 13th\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" TV series. In this televised spin-off of \"Psycho\", Norman Bates is portrayed by Kurt Paul, who previously stood in as a stunt double for Anthony Perkins in \"Psycho II\" and \"Psycho III\". Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a pilot for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up. Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the 4th of July weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\n[6] Norma Bates (Psycho): The television spin-off movie and series pilot changes the backstory between Norman Bates' parents (here named Jake and Gloria Bates) prior to the events of \"Psycho\". In this continuity, Mrs. Bates killed her husband because she thought he was cheating on her. She then lost her mind and spent all her time staring out her bedroom window, wearing black funeral clothes while waiting for him to return. Twenty-seven years after the events of the original film, Norman (Kurt Paul) dies of old age in the asylum, leaving his motel and house to his friend and fellow inmate, Alex West (Bud Cort). Alex comes to believe that the motel is haunted by Mrs. Bates' ghost. He eventually discovers that the \"haunting\" is a ruse perpetrated by bank manager Tom Fuller (Gregg Henry), who is trying to scare Alex into selling him the motel so he can renovate it.\n\n[7] Norman Bates: Norman Bates is a fictional character created by American author Robert Bloch as the main antagonist in his 1959 thriller novel \"Psycho\"; portrayed by Anthony Perkins in the 1960 version of \"Psycho\" directed by Alfred Hitchcock and the \"Psycho\" franchise. He is also portrayed by Vince Vaughn in the 1998 version of \"Psycho\", and by Freddie Highmore in the television series \"Bates Motel\" (2013–2017). Unlike the franchise produced by Universal Studios, Norman is not the principal antagonist in Bloch's subsequent novels and is succeeded by copycat killers who assume Norman's identity after his death in 1982's \"Psycho II\". Despite wide-ranging assumptions, the character was not inspired by Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein. Bloch later revealed that he was nearly finished writing \"Psycho\" when he first became aware of Gein, and was struck by \"how closely the imaginary character I'd created resembled the real Ed Gein both in overt act and apparent motivation.\"\n\n[8] Psycho IV: The Beginning: Actress Olivia Hussey was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates. It was the intention of writer Joseph Stefano to make her at a young age as attractive as Norman had been in the first film. When Henry Thomas was cast as the young Norman Bates, Perkins wanted to meet with him and discuss the role. Thomas stated, in the documentary \"The Psycho Legacy:\" \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\" During filming, Perkins was diagnosed with HIV and had to receive treatment during production. Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made 'because it looks good,' and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That,\" Garris says, \"was gratifying.\"\n\n[9] Norman Bates: Norman Bates was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in Hitchcock's seminal 1960 film adaptation of Bloch's novel and its three sequels. Perkins hosted an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1976 in which he performed numerous sketches portraying Norman, including the instructional video \"The Norman Bates School of Motel Management\". He also portrayed Norman, albeit more lightheartedly, in a 1990 commercial for Oatmeal Crisp cereal. Vince Vaughn portrayed Norman in Gus Van Sant's 1998 version of \"Psycho\", while Kurt Paul, Perkins' \"Mother\" stunt double in \"Psycho II\" and \"Psycho III\", took on the role in the made-for-TV film spin-off \"Bates Motel\". Perkins' son Oz portrayed a younger version of Norman in \"Psycho II\". Henry Thomas played a younger version of the character in \"\". Freddie Highmore portrayed Norman in the TV series \"Bates Motel\". For his performance, Highmore was nominated twice for a Critic's Choice Award, a Saturn Award, and won a People's Choice Award in 2017.\n\n[10] Norma Bates (Psycho): In the film \"Psycho II\" (unrelated to Bloch's novel of the same name), twenty-two years later, Norman Bates, now supposedly cured, is released from the institution and returns home. He soon receives notes and phone calls supposedly from Mrs. Bates. Norman takes a job at a local diner and befriends Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar), the cook, and a waitress named Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly). Norman offers Mary a room in his house, and she reluctantly accepts. At about this time, a series of mysterious murders are committed by a woman with a knife to people who come to the motel and the house.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

After the overthrow of the Qing in 1911 and following Chinese Civil War, the Communists took refuge in Guizhou during the Long March (1934–1935). While the province was formally ruled by the Guomindang warlord Wang Jialie, the Zunyi Conference in Guizhou established Mao Zedong as the leader of the Communist Party. As the Second Sino-Japanese War pushed China's Nationalist Government to its southwest base of Chongqing, transportation infrastructure improved as Guizhou was linked with the Burma Road. After the end of the War, a 1949 Revolution swept Mao into power, who promoted the relocation of heavy industry into inland provinces such as Guizhou, to better protect them from Soviet and American attacks. After the Chinese economic reform began in 1978, geographical factors led Guizhou to become the poorest province in China, with a GDP growth average of 9 percent from 1978–1993.\n\n[2] Mao Zedong: Mao Zedong (; December 26, 1893September 9, 1976), also known as Chairman Mao, was a Chinese communist revolutionary who became the founding father of the People's Republic of China, which he ruled as the Chairman of the Communist Party of China from its establishment in 1949 until his death in 1976. His theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.\n\n[3] Cultural Revolution: The Cultural Revolution, formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement in China from 1966 until 1976. Launched by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve Chinese Communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought (known outside China simply as Maoism) as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked Mao's return to a position of power after the failures of his Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected both the economy and society of the country to a significant degree.\n\n[4] Human rights in China: Political abuse of psychiatry began in China during the 1950s, shortly after the establishment of the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong, and it continued in different forms from then until the late 1980s. Initially, under Mao Zedong, the practice of psychiatry in China saw legitimate improvements in the breadth and quality of treatments. However, as time passed under the direction of Mao Zedong and the campaign of ideological reform was implemented, psychiatric diagnoses became used as a way to control and incarcerate Chinese citizens who didn't subscribe to Maoist ideologies such as Marxism–Leninism. The main demographic of Chinese citizens being targeted and placed in mental asylums were academics, intellectuals, students, and religious groups for their capitalist tendencies and bourgeois worldview. The justification for placing those who didn't comply with Maoist principles in mental institutions was that non-Maoist political ideologies such as capitalism caused extreme individualism and selfishness, which contributed to mental disabilities such as schizophrenia and paranoid psychosis in the individual. Maoists supported this claim that anti-Communist beliefs caused mental imbalances with the positive correlation between the wealth and class of a group of people and the amount of \"mentally ill\" people within that group.\n\n[5] Ten Major Relationships: Though the trend of anti-personality cult was prevalent in the socialist camp after 1953, Shen argues that Mao only opposed the public use of Mao Zedong Thought, but not saw it as a problem itself. Hu Qiaomu explained that not mentioning Mao Zedong Thought was related to the Soviet Union who refused to accept the idea. And since China still relied on the Soviet Union in the early 1950s, so that was Mao's policy to downplay the idea. The Soviet-Yugoslavia conflict in 1948 had signaled that Stalin would not tolerate alternative socialist path and the Soviet Union remained dominant in the socialist world. After Stlain's death in 1953, however, the pressure from the Soviet Union lessened, yet Mao still had not put forward the use of Mao Zedong Though publicly because of the possible backlash due to the anti-personality cult in the Soviet Union. The development led to the concerns from top Chinese leaders. After the 20th Soviet party congress, personality cult had became an even more sensitive issue and invited the speculation of whether there was personality cult in China. At local level, cadres started to raise doubt about the excessive praise given to Mao and internationally socialist countries also became cautious about personality cult. Yet the personal worship of Mao within the party already began in the Yan’an era, so it had a long historical root in the party. Though the criticism of Stalin relieved Mao of the pressure from the Soviet Union, it\n\n[6] Poetry of Mao Zedong: Mao Zedong (1893–1976), the first Chairman of the Communist Party of China and leader of the People's Republic of China for nearly 30 years, wrote poetry, starting in the 1920s, during the Red Army's epic retreat during the Long March of 1934-1936, and after coming to power in 1949. In spite of Mao's political radicalism he was artistically conservative, opting to use traditional Chinese forms.\n\n[7] 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China: After Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, the Congress was deemed to have been \"incorrect ideologically, politically, and organizationally. The guiding directions of the congress were, on the whole, wrong.\" Part of the Long Live the Victory of Mao Zedong Thought statue includes a group of soldiers and civilians propagating the appeal of the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.\n\n[8] Red: The Communist Party of China, founded in 1920, adopted the red flag and hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union, which became the national symbols when the Party took power in China in 1949. Under Party leader Mao Zedong, the Party anthem became \"The East Is Red\", and Mao Zedong himself was sometimes referred to as a \"red sun\". During the Cultural Revolution in China, Party ideology was enforced by the Red Guards, and the sayings of Mao Zedong were published as a small red book in hundreds of millions of copies. Today the Communist Party of China claims to be the largest political party in the world, with eighty million members.\n\n[9] Mao Zedong: Though the Chinese Communist Party, which Mao led to power, has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao's ideology, it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao's reign: it controls the Chinese army, police, courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or local level, except in Hong Kong. Thus it is difficult to gauge the true extent of support for the Chinese Communist Party and Mao's legacy within mainland China. For its part, the Chinese government continues to officially regard Mao as a national hero. On December 25, 2008, China opened the Mao Zedong Square to visitors in his home town of central Hunan Province to mark the 115th anniversary of his birth.\n\n[10] History of communism: Mao Zedong and the Communist Party came to power in China in 1949, as the Nationalists fled to the island of Taiwan. In 1950–1953, China engaged in a large-scale but undeclared war with the United States, South Korea and United Nations forces in the Korean War. It ended in a military stalemate, but it gave Mao the opportunity to identify and purge elements in China that seemed supportive of capitalism. At first there was close cooperation with Stalin, who sent in technical experts to aid the industrialization process along the line of the Soviet model of the 1930s. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with Moscow soured—Mao thought Stalin's successors had betrayed the Communist ideal. Mao charged that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of a \"revisionist clique\" which had turned against Marxism and Leninism was now setting the stage for the restoration of capitalism. The two nations were at sword's point by 1960. Both began forging alliances with communist supporters around the globe, thereby splitting the worldwide movement into two hostile camps.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWho took power after Mao Zedong in China?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite, at the eastern edge of the Cordillera de San Buenaventura. Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic–trachyandesitic volcanites 9–7 mya old and an igneous-metamorphic granitic basement containing orthogneiss, quartz of Neoproterozoic-early Paleozoic age, containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions. The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies. This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc.\n\n[2] Cerro Blanco (volcano): The caldera floor has been subsiding in the 1990s according to satellite images. The diameter of the deformation region is less than and the deformation occurs at depths of less than . The deflation speed has been decreasing from more than between 1992 and 1997 over between 1996 and 2000 and between 2003 and 2007 to between 2005 and 2010. This deformation is centered between the Robledo and Cerro Blanco calderas and is accompanied by an uplift to the northwest. The deflation has been interpreted to depend on a magma chamber with a diameter of but is unlikely to be caused by magma withdrawal or tectonic expansion. It may be linked to hydrothermal effects however. A seismic swarm was noted at depth in 2007 and 2009.\n\n[3] Cerro Blanco (volcano): Nevado Tres Cruces lies to the west and Nevado Ojos del Salado lies to the southwest of the Cerro Blanco centre. East-northeast running fault systems are controlled by local tectonics and may be responsible for the formation of the Cordillera de San Buenaventura. The 4-3.7 mya Laguna Amarga west of Cerro Blanco erupted rhyolites, unlike Cerro Blanco's ignimbrites. The better known Cerro Galán caldera lies northeast of Cerro Blanco. It forms a southwest-northeast volcanic line with Cerro Blanco and Incapillo. This line was active less than 2.5 mya ago. Another trend is defined by the Culampaja line running from Sierra Nevada over Cerro Cóndor and Cerro Peinado to Blanco. Other volcanic centres in the region are the Miocene-Pliocene ignimbrites Las Juntas and Las Papas. Minor bimodal–mafic volcanic centres during the Pleistocene–Holocene include volcanoes in the Pasto Ventura, Salar de Carachi Pampa and Volcán Negro Peinado areals. Felsic centres include Chascón and Cueros de Purulla. Cerro Purulla lies north-northwest of Cerro Blanco and the La Hoyada volcanic complex lies directly west. Cueros de Purulla and Chascón are major sources of obsidian in the Puna of Catamarca region.\n\n[4] Cerro Blanco (volcano): The Aguada Alumbrera Ignimbrite is a white-rosa ignimbrite composed from two units, 7.14 mya and 13.57 mya . The Blanquecina unit is of white to white-rosa colour and contains amphibole, biotite and quartz crystals. It contains lithic fragments of dacitic composition. The groundmass of the ignimbrite is grey in colour and contains glass and phenocrysts. Next to Laguna Aguada Alumbrera it is thick. The ignimbrite is unconformably overlaid by ignimbrites from La Hoyada volcano and overlies the basement. There are fluvial deposits contained within the Blanquecina ignimbrite, suggesting that sedimentation occurred between the eruptions. The other subunit Rojiza is of white colour and is rich in biotite and quartz. It is mostly buried by other deposits; south of Aguada Alumbrera the principal deposit is thick. This ignimbrite crops out south of Cerro Blanco.\n\n[5] Cerro Azul, Panama: Cerro Azul (\"Blue Mountains\") is a mountainous part of Panama Province. There is a well marked road leading to Cerro Azul from the 24 de Diciembre town of the Panama District of Panama City. The mountains reach an altitude of 950 meters (Cerro Jefe). Cerro Azul includes several villages including Rancho Cafe, Buena Vista, Las Vistas, Las Nubes and Los Altos. There is a lake on the main route to Cerro Azul where alligators have been spotted. The climate of Cerro Azul is pretty cool and it is a preferred weekend retreat for wealthy city dwellers wanting to escape the heat. Cerro Azul is an important poultry farming area, the Panamanian chicken and egg producer MELO has its production headquarters in Cerro Azul. Las Nubes and Los Altos de Cerro Azul have notable expatriate communities of mainly North American origin. Cerro Azul has gotten global media coverage after the \"Cerro Azul monster\" discovery.\n\n[6] Cerro Blanco (volcano): The Cerro Blanco complex is formed from pyroclastic flows extending from nested calderas. The Robledo caldera is heavily eroded and has assumed a semicircular shape. The rim of the Cerro Blanco caldera proper is well-preserved, with ash and block flows filling the interior. Another theory holds that the northern Cerro Blanco and the southern Robledo calderas are part of one caldera with a minimum subsidence of and a dimension of . The Cerro Blanco caldera is wide. On its southern rim, surrounded by ashfall deposits, lies the Holocene Cerro Blanco del Robledo lava dome (). Some sources call the whole volcano Robledo and use Cerro Blanco to refer to the lava dome. A third caldera north of Cerro Blanco is known as El Niño caldera The whole volcanic complex is formed from lava domes, ignimbrites, ash and block flows and unconsolidated deposits. Cerro Blanco is the largest lava dome and has a debris collapse deposit on its northern side. A hydrothermally altered area in the middle of the caldera has been linked to phreatomagmatic activity. The El Escondido crater northeast of the caldera is wide and deep. It shows a dark colour and semiannular shape in satellite images and has been interpreted as a phreatic crater. Other such craters are located within the caldera. Aside from craters and calderas, there are about seven lava domes west of the caldera\n\n[7] Cerro Blanco (volcano): 2,300 ± 160 BCE a large Plinian eruption occurred at Cerro Blanco. Rhyolites with a volume of generated ashfalls and ignimbrites, forming the largest known eruption in the Central Andes during the Holocene and one of the largest in the world during the Holocene. Ash from this eruption covered an area of or over . These Purulla/El Médano ignimbrites () cover an area of with a volume of volcanic material and are dated to have occurred less than 12,200 years ago on the basis of radiocarbon analysis of organic material contained between various ignimbrite layers. One layer in La Hoyada is dated between 8,830 and 5,480 BP. Other data attribute the Purulla ignimbrites to 22,000 years ago. The date of the major Holocene eruption is constrained to between 5,500 and 4,000 years ago. Based on stratigraphic relationships, the Cerro Blanco caldera formed during this eruption. The location of the vent did not change during the course of the eruption, indicating that the annular fractures around the caldera were possibly uninvolved in the process. Ash falls occurred at distances of over and valleys were filled by pyroclastic flows as far as from the vent. The low population density in the Fiambalá valley south of the volcano during the 10,000–3,000 B.P interval is ascribed to this eruption, which affected the valley with ignimbrites and pyroclastic fall\n\n[8] Cerro Blanco (volcano): A lava dome () formed 7.3 ± 0.5 mya and red ignimbrite 8.1 ± 0.5 mya. 2.3–1.3 mya an east-northeast chain of andesitic lava domes was formed, with the youngest dome () being 1.3 ± 0.4 mya old and located next to Cerro Blanco. 0.8 mya mafic andesite was erupted south and west of Carachipampa () and Laguna de Purulla (). The Cueros de Purulla obsidian lava dome () formed 0.4 ± 0.1 mya.\n\n[9] Cerro Blanco (volcano): The Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is an area between 14–28° southern latitude where volcanic activity dates to the Eocene. Ignimbritic activity has occurred over the whole area, particularly north of 25° southern latitude where the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex is situated. Ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate shoshonite. The more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content. With the exception of the Luingo caldera and Cerro Galán, most volcanism south of 25° southern latitude is of low volume. After a phase of pyroclastic activity in the Antofalla area during the Eocene, a number of volcanoes formed from calc-alkaline magmas during the Miocene. Changes in subduction geometry including the removal of continental crust from the boundary 8-3 mya have caused a thickening of the crust as well as an eastward shift of the volcanic front. Huaynaputina volcano in Peru is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and had a major eruption in 1600.\n\n[10] Cerro Blanco (volcano): The volcano is also known for giant ripple marks that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures. These ripple marks have heights up to and are separated by distances up to . Unlike dunes, they do not migrate with the wind and are stationary. These ripple marks are among the most extreme on Earth and have been compared to Martian ripple marks by geologists.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the answer to the question \"How wide is Cerro Blanco?\" based on the given contexts.\n\nNote: Please answer \"I don't know\" if the information is not available in any of the given contexts", "llama-2-7b-chat": "No, answer is not present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

As a result of good sales in Atlanta, and a desire to decentralize production, Ford established a combined assembly, sales, service and administration facility on Ponce de Leon Avenue, selling a peak of 22,000 vehicles per year. The assembly plant produced Model Ts, Model As and V-8s until 1942, when the plant was sold to the War Department and a new plant was opened in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville.\n\n[2] Ford Motor Company: In 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company Hyundai, and at the new factory in Ulsan, South Korea, built the European Ford Cortina until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new Hyundai Pony in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer Kia which built vehicles co-engineered with Mazda, later selling the Ford Festiva from 1988–1993, and the Ford Aspire from 1994–1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer Mazda in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's Familia and Capella as the Ford Laser and Telstar throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998, Hyundai Motor Company acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986. After subsequent divestments, Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.\n\n[3] Ford Piquette Avenue Plant: In 1905, Ford Motor Company was the fourth-largest car producer in the United States, behind Cadillac, Rambler, and Oldsmobile. In the company's early years, most major components in its cars were manufactured by outside companies, including the \"running gear\" (the chassis, engine, transmission, drive shaft, and axles), which was supplied by the Dodge Brothers Company. That began to change in early 1906, when the Ford Manufacturing Company, a new, separate company created by Henry Ford and some Ford Motor Company stockholders, started to make engines and transmissions for the upcoming Ford Model N. The Ford Manufacturing Company was located at the Bellevue Avenue Plant, a leased factory off of Bellevue Avenue in Detroit. The Bellevue Avenue Plant was used until 1908, by which time almost all manufacturing of major components for Ford Motor Company cars was taking place at the Piquette Avenue Plant. Model N production began at the Piquette Avenue Plant in July 1906. That same month, Henry Ford bought the Ford Motor Company shares owned by fellow company co-founder Alexander Malcomson. While Malcomson was with the company, he and Henry Ford disagreed over the type of car that the company should produce. Malcomson preferred expensive cars, like the Ford Model K; Henry Ford favored inexpensive cars, like the Model N. Once Malcomson was no longer part of the company, Henry Ford, now with uncontested control, focused the company's efforts towards making cheap cars exclusively. The success of the Model N made\n\n[4] Technological and industrial history of 20th-century Canada: The Ford Motor Company of Canada, founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. It manufactured cars in that city and was the first company to use the assembly line manufacturing technique in Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first internal combustion engines built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. A number of different types, all based on US designs, were manufactured including, the Ford Model-A, Ford Model-C, Ford Model-K, Ford Model-N and Ford Model-T. During WWII, the Canadian Military Pattern Truck, was built there. Following the war, the Ford Meteor was assembled until production moved to the new Ford plant in Oakville in 1953, where production has continued until this day.\n\n[5] Ford Motor Company - Columbus Assembly Plant: Ford Motor Company relied on a network of sales agencies-dealers which agreed to sell Model T cars, stock parts, and provide mechanics' services. Ford initially manufactured fully assembled cars in Detroit and then \"knocked them down\" (took off the wheels and otherwise prepared them for shipment) and shipped them to dealers. The agents in distant cities reassembled the knocked-down cars before sale. To better serve the network of sales dealerships. Ford took direct control of agencies in New York and Philadelphia in 1905 and the following year established company-owned branches in Boston, Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City, initially in leased buildings. Ford branches also sold Ford cars in addition to assembling vehicles for delivery to dealerships. Ford sold over 200,000 autos in 1914, with 80 percent of sales originating from the company's twenty-nine branches. As Ford sales continued to increase, the company built additional branch assembly plants in company-owned buildings, most of which were designed by Architect Albert Kahn.\n\n[6] History of Ford Motor Company: Ford Motor Company is an American automaker and the world's fifth largest automaker based on worldwide vehicle sales. Based in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, the automaker was founded by Henry Ford, on June 16, 1903. Ford Motor Company would go on to become one of the largest and most profitable companies in the world, as well as being one of the few to survive the Great Depression. The largest family-controlled company in the world, the Ford Motor Company has been in continuous family control for over 110 years. Ford now encompasses two brands: Ford and Lincoln. Ford once owned 5 other luxury brands: Volvo, Land Rover, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Mercury. Over time, those brands were sold to other companies and Mercury was discontinued.\n\n[7] Ford Motor Company Philippines: Ford's history in the Philippines can be traced back to 1913 with the local assembly of the Ford Model T. In 1929, Henry Ford established Pilipinas Ford Car Works, Inc. (PFCW). In 1967, Ford Philippines, Inc. (FPI) was established as a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company and began production operations on May 3, 1968, located at Sucat, Parañaque. In 1976, FPI inaugurated a body stamping plant in Mariveles, Bataan. On March 20, 1984, FPI formally and unexpectedly announced it would cease its operations in the Philippines by August 1984, in accordance with a decision reached by the management of Ford Motor Company.\n\n[8] Ford Germany: Until 27 January 1950 all Ford's European operations other than in the USSR were run from Dagenham and owned by Ford Motor Company Limited, Dearborn's 55% owned subsidiary. In Ford Motor Company Limited's published reports to their British shareholders Germany and the other Ford European interests were referred to as 'the associated companies'. These associate companies had been established in order to allow for substantial holdings by local shareholders. On the outbreak of the second world war those shares in Ford Motor Company AG not belonging to German shareholders were placed under the control of the German Commissioner for dealing with enemy property.\n\n[9] Ford Germany: At the end of 1924 the US Ford Motor Company established a sales office in Berlin which at the start of 1925 received a permit to import 1,000 tractors. In 1920 the government had imposed a tariff so high that it amounted to a prohibition against importing foreign automobiles, but this was reversed in October 1925. The move had evidently been anticipated by Ford, since on 18 August 1925 the \"Ford Motor Company Aktiengesellschaft\" had been entered in the Berlin Companies Register.\n\n[10] Ford Motor Company of Canada: The Ford Motor Company of Canada was not a subsidiary or a branch plant of Ford Motor Company – rather, it was a separate organization and had its own distinct group of shareholders. At its formation, Ford Motor Company was not a shareholder of Ford Canada, but its twelve founding shareholders directly held 51% of Ford Canada's shares, and Henry Ford himself owned 13% of the new company. The Company had gained all Ford patent rights and selling privileges to all parts of the British Empire, except Great Britain and Ireland. It eventually established and managed the following subsidiaries:The Model C, the first car to be produced in Canada, rolled out of the factory in late September 1904. The Company could produce two cars at a time and in its first full year of production, the Company was able to produce 117 automobiles. The Company's first export sales were to Calcutta, India. Ford is still an important manufacturing enterprise in Windsor.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was Ford Motor Company established?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Two years later, on 14 October 2007, voters of the Democratic Party were called to choose the party leader among a list of six, their representatives to the Constituent Assembly and the local leaders. The primary was a success, involving more than 3,500,000 people across Italy, and gave to the winner Walter Veltroni momentum in a difficult period for the government and the centre-left coalition. The centre-right (see House of Freedoms, The People of Freedom, centre-right coalition and Forza Italia) has never held a primary at the national level, but held some experiments at the very local level.\n\n[2] 2014 European Parliament election in Italy: The governing Democratic Party (PD) won the election with 40.8% of the vote and 31 seats, followed by the Five Star Movement (21.2% and 17 seats) and Forza Italia (16.8% and 13 seats). As a result, the PD was the second largest national party in the European Parliament by number of seats after the German CDU/CSU and the largest among the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. The PD's score was also the best result for an Italian party in a nationwide election since the 1958 general election, when the Christian Democracy won 42.4% of the vote.\n\n[3] 2019 European Parliament election in Italy: In 2014 the governing Democratic Party (PD) of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi won the election with 40.8% of the vote and 31 seats, followed by the Five Star Movement (21.2% and 17 seats) and Forza Italia (16.8% and 13 seats). As a result, the PD was the second largest national party in the European Parliament by number of seats after the German CDU/CSU and the largest among the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats. The PD's score was also the best result for an Italian party in a nationwide election since the 1958 general election, when the Christian Democracy won 42.4% of the vote.\n\n[4] 2019 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election: The elected provincial delegates will take part in the Provincial Conventions in a date set between 29 or 30 January, to elect the delegates for the National Convention, each linked to a national candidate. Just like the Circle Conventions, the number of the delegates elected for every province are fixed by the National Committee, half on the basis of the result of the party in the latest election and half on the average membership of the province between 2016 and 2017. The National Convention will take place on 2 February; it's composed of 1,000 delegates, and it will announce the results of the votes that will be held in the Circle Conventions and will list the candidates admitted to the open primary and the National Assembly, according to one of these conditions:\n\n[5] 2019 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election: With the official resignation presented by Secretary Maurizio Martina on 30 October, the President must gather the members of the National Assembly within a month, which was held on 17 November on Rome after the convocation of the President, Matteo Orfini, officially starting the primaries. In the same day, the National Assembly elects the members of the “National Committee for the Congress” (which will act in place of the elected bodies until the end of the leadership election), that the National Assembly has to follow, through the approval of the “Rules of the Primaries” where are stated the rules, the dates and the procedure that the party must perform for the process of the leadership election. The National Committee also handle the internal disputes and appeals during the primary election.\n\n[6] 2017 United Nations Security Council election: The 2017 United Nations Security Council election was held on 2 June 2017 during the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly, held at United Nations Headquarters in New York City. In addition to the regular elections for five of the non-permanent seats on the UN Security Council, there was by-election for a sixth seat held by Italy who relinquished its seat at the end of the year as part of a term splitting agreement with the Netherlands. The regular elections are for two-year mandates commencing on 1 January 2018; the by-election is for the remainder of Italy's term. In accordance with the Security Council's rotation rules, whereby the ten non-permanent UNSC seats rotate among the various regional blocs into which UN member states traditionally divide themselves for voting and representation purposes, the five regularly available seats are allocated as follows:The six elected members began their two-year terms on the 1st of January, 2018 , and will continue to serve on the Security Council until the end of 2019.\n\n[7] 2019 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election: After the assignment of the National Committee, their members elect a President to coordinate the activities, and they write the rules and the dates and propose them to the National Board. The election must take place within four months following the presentation of the resignation of the Secretary. On 28 November, the National Board unanimously approved the proposals made by the National Committee, setting the date of the leadership election on 3 March.\n\n[8] 2019 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election: In the next day of the Democratic National Committee meeting on 23 November, member of the Chamber of Deputies Lia Quartapelle launched a petition to move up the date of the primary election to January instead of 3 March. The proposal met the support of the former Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, Marianna Madia, Carlo Calenda Debora Serracchiani, Pierfrancesco Majorino and the Mayor of Bergamo, Giorgio Gori. Even the candidates Maurizio Martina and Matteo Richetti welcomed the proposal, while Francesco Boccia strongly rejected the idea.\n\n[9] Brothers of Italy: In November 2018, in the run-up of the next European Parliament election, the party agreed to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament, opening the way for a pact with other minor conservative parties in Italy, notably including Raffaele Fitto's Direction Italy.\n\n[10] 2017 Democratic Party (Italy) leadership election: The candidates who will run in an open primary will be declared at the national convention, which will take place on 30 April. Voters will also elect the national assembly of the party and the regional secretaries and assemblies. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, a run-off between the two candidates with the most votes will take place in the national assembly, scheduled within two weeks after the primary election.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen are the next national elections in Italy?\n\nPlease select one of the following options:\n\nA) 2018\nB) 2019\nC) 2", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know when the next national elections in Italy will be held?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nI don't know in context [2].\nI don't know in context [3].\nYes, answer is present in context [4].\nI don't know in", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

In 1979 he voiced Mr. Tumnus in the USA dubbed version of the 1979 animated adaptation of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" as well as voice directing for the film. Later he voiced arch villain Texas Pete in the popular S4C animated TV series \"SuperTed\" (1982–84) and narrated several \"Fireman Sam\" audiobooks. In 1992, he voiced the King of the Rats in the British children's animated programme \"Tales of the Tooth Fairies\" (in the episode The Stolen Present) on BBC, produced by Welsh animation company Calon (formerly Siriol Productions. In 1995 he appeared in an episode of \"Bottom\" with Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson as Audrey the Maitre d'. Spinetti also starred in \"Boobs in the Wood\" with Jim Davidson, filmed for DVD in 1999.\n\n[2] The Biggest Loser (season 7): In the temptation challenge, each contestant is put in a room with piles of tempting foods for five minutes. Their at-home partners each face a similar temptation. The team that consumes the most calories wins a visit home for the partner on the ranch, with the team's trainer making the trip as well. Mandi eats one slice of pizza (380 calories). Sione (blue, at-home) eats two slices of pizza and one taco (960 calories total) because he wants to see his trainer again. Carla (silver, at-home) eats 3 slices of pizza, 5 chicken nuggets, 1 taco, and 2 cup cakes, for a total of 2710 calories, winning the challenge. None of the other players are shown consuming any food. Filipe says that Joelle does not deserve this, and that Mandi should have won because she wanted to see her sons. The Orange team does not participate in the temptation. While the reason is not mentioned in the episode, it was indicated later that Dan was off campus for additional medical testing at the time.\n\n[3] Heaton Chapel: A large biscuit works was opened in 1918 by McVitie and Price, later McVitie's, part of United Biscuits. In this location chocolate covered biscuits such as Penguin biscuits and Jaffa Cakes are manufactured.\n\n[4] Jaffa Crvenka: Jaffa Crvenka is a Serbian food company based in Crvenka, specializing in confectionery products. Its most well-known product is its Jaffa Cakes, sharing the same name as the original McVitie's biscuits.\n\n[5] Jaffa Cakes: McVitie's entire line of Jaffa cakes are produced in the United Kingdom at the McVitie's factory in Stockport. The Jaffa cake production area covers an acre () and includes a production line over a mile () long which sits on the Stockport side of the site's boundary with Manchester. Because of the nature of the product – having multiple components of cake, chocolate covering and jam – special hardware accelerators were devised to allow rapid computer inspection of 20 products per second, taking place under four symmetrically placed lights.\n\n[6] McVitie's: The best-selling biscuit manufacturer in the United Kingdom, McVitie’s produces chocolate digestives, Hobnobs and Rich tea (ranked the three favourite biscuits to dunk into tea), and Jaffa Cakes (the best selling cake in the UK).\n\n[7] Jaffa Cakes: Jaffa Cakes are biscuit-sized cakes introduced by McVitie and Price in the UK in 1927 and named after Jaffa oranges. The most common form of Jaffa cakes are circular, in diameter and have three layers: a Genoise sponge base, a layer of orange flavoured jam and a coating of chocolate. Jaffa cakes are also available as bars or in small packs, and in larger and smaller sizes. The original Jaffa Cakes come in packs of 12, 24 or 36.\n\n[8] Jaffa Cakes: Because McVitie's did not trademark the name \"Jaffa Cakes\", other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name. The product's classification as a cake or biscuit was part of a VAT tribunal in 1991, with the court finding in McVitie's favour that the Jaffa cake should be considered a cake for tax purposes. In 2012 they were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the United Kingdom.\n\n[9] Jaffa Cakes: In the United Kingdom, value added tax is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, but not on chocolate-covered cakes. McVities defended its classification of Jaffa Cakes as cakes at a VAT tribunal in 1991, against the ruling that Jaffa cakes were biscuits due to their size and shape, and the fact that they were often eaten in place of biscuits. McVities insisted that the product was a cake, and allegedly produced a giant Jaffa cake in court to illustrate its point. The product was assessed on the following criteria:The court found in favour of McVitie's and ruled that the product should be considered a cake, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa cakes in the United Kingdom.\n\n[10] McVitie's: The McVitie's Chocolate Homewheat Digestive was created in 1925. Over 71 million packets of McVitie's chocolate digestives are eaten in the United Kingdom each year, equating to 52 biscuits per second. HobNobs were launched in 1985 and a milk chocolate variant followed in 1987. Launched in 1927, Jaffa Cakes were ranked the best selling cake or biscuit in the UK in 2012.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nHow many calories in a McVitie’s Jaffa Cake?\n\nPlease answer with a \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The bill also stipulates formation of a new body, the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI).\n\n[2] University Grants Commission (Bangladesh): The University Grants Commission (UGC) ( \"Biśbobidyālaẏ mañjurī komiśan\") of Bangladesh was established on 16 December 1972. It was created according to the Presidential Order (P.O. No 10 of 1973) of the Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh. In 2010, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) announced bringing out reforms in University Grants Commission (UGC) and decided to change UGC into Higher Education Commission of Bangladesh (HEC).\n\n[3] University Grants Commission (India): Accreditation for higher learning over Universities under the aegis of University Grants Commission is overseen by following fifteen autonomous statutory institutions :In 2009, the Union Minister of Human Resource Development, Kapil Sibal made known the government of India's plans to consider the closing down of the UGC and the related body All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), in favour of a higher regulatory body with more sweeping powers. This goal, proposed by the Higher Education and Research (HE&R) Bill, 2011, intends to replace the UGC with a \"National Commission for Higher Education & Research (NCHER)\" \"for determination, coordination, maintenance and continued enhancement of standards of higher education and research\". The bill proposes absorbing the UGC and other academic agencies into this new organisation. Those agencies involved in medicine and law would be exempt from this merger \"to set minimum standards for medical and legal education leading to professional practice\". The bill has received opposition from the local governments of the Indian states of Bihar, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, but has received general support.\n\n[4] Malcolm Grant: Grant was appointed as chair of the newly formed NHS Commissioning Board in 2011 by the Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley. He was previously the ninth President and Provost of University College London – the head as well as principal academic and administrative officer of the university – for over a decade from 2003 until 2013. He is the current Chancellor of the University of York.\n\n[5] Higher Education Commission (Pakistan): Preceded by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2002 by promulgation of the Higher Education Commission Ordinance 2002, the universities were formerly accredited by the UGC established in 1947; the institution was revised 1974 and came its modern form in 2002 under the leadership of Atta-ur-Rahman its founding Chairman, with additional executive reforms granted by the constitution. It operates directly under the Prime Minister and is not subservient to the Ministry of Education. Under a new and revised reforms, the HEC is made responsible for formulating higher education policy and quality assurance to meet the international standards as well as providing accrediting academic degrees, development of new institutions, and uplift of existing institutions in Pakistan. The major developments in the higher education sector occurred under the leadership of Atta-ur-Rahman, the founding Chairman, during 2002-2008. The remarkable transformation in the higher education sector was acknowledged in an article in the world's leading science journal, Nature, in which Rahman was called a \"force of nature\" After Prof. Atta-ur-Rahman resigned in protest in 2008 due to the suspension of scholarships of thousands of students abroad by the PPP government, the university development programmes slowed down due to cut in budget and introduction of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures.\n\n[6] University Grants Commission (India): The University Grants Commission of India (UGC India) is a statutory body set up by the Indian Union government in accordance to the UGC Act 1956 under Ministry of Human Resource Development, and is charged with coordination, determination and maintenance of standards of higher education. It provides recognition to universities in India, and disbursements of funds to such recognised universities and colleges. Its headquarters is in New Delhi, and has six regional centres in Pune, Bhopal, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Guwahati and Bangalore.\n\n[7] Yash Pal: Yash Pal's administrative assignments at the government-level and beyond began with his appointment as the Secretary General of the Second United Nations Conference on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (1981–82). He held the posts of Chief Consultant, Planning Commission (1983–84) and Secretary, Department of Science and Technology (1984–1986), after which he was appointed chairman, University Grants Commission (UGC) (1986–91). During his tenure as UGC chairman, he advocated the setting up of Inter-University Centres funded by the UGC, on the model of the Nuclear Science Centre (now Inter-University Accelerator Centre), New Delhi. Institutions such as the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) emerged from this vision.\n\n[8] University Grants Committee (Hong Kong): UGC-funded universities are:The Quality Assurance Council (QAC), established in April 2007, is a semi-autonomous non-statutory body operating under the purview of the Committee to facilitate quality assurance of all programmes at the levels of sub-degree, first degree and above (however funded), offered by UGC-funded universities.\n\n[9] University Grants Committee (United Kingdom): In the early 1980s the chairman was Edward Parkes, who oversaw cuts in university funding. Parkes was succeeded by Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, under whose chairmanship the UGC conducted its first \"Research Selectivity Exercise\" in 1986. This decided the disbursement of funds for University research, and was a precursor to the Research Assessment Exercise and the Research Excellence Framework.\n\n[10] University Grants Commission (India): In December 2017 D.P. Singh, former director of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), was appointed chairman for a period of five years, replacing UGC member Virander Singh Chauhan, who officiated the position since the retirement of Ved Prakash in April 2017.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWho has been appointed as the new Chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2022?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes,", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know who the new Chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) in 2022 is?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nContexts:\n\n[1] No\n[2] No\n[3] No\n[4] No\n[5] No\n[6] No\n[7] No\n[8] No\n[9] No", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl created two epic propaganda films, \"Der Sieg des Glaubens\" or \"Victory of Faith\" (1933) and \"Triumph des Willens\" or \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935) that depicted the fervent Nazi multitudes in the 1930s Nuremberg Rallies.\n\n[2] Triumph of the Will: Triumph of the Will () is a 1935 Nazi propaganda film directed, produced, edited, and co-written by Leni Riefenstahl. It chronicles the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, which was attended by more than 700,000 Nazi supporters. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Adolf Hitler, Rudolf Hess and Julius Streicher, interspersed with footage of massed Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) troops and public reaction. Hitler commissioned the film and served as an unofficial executive producer; his name appears in the opening titles. The film's overriding theme is the return of Germany as a great power, with Hitler as the leader who will bring glory to the nation. Because the film was made after the 1934 Night of the Long Knives (on 30 June), many prominent Sturmabteilung (SA) members are absent—they were murdered in that Party purge, organised and orchestrated by Hitler to replace the SA with the Schutzstaffel (SS) as his main paramilitary force.\n\n[3] Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda: As the central office of Nazi propaganda, it comprehensively supervised and regulated the culture and mass media of Nazi Germany. A major focus of the propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality. Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work. An example of the latter would be the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. Hitler was the focus and his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film \"Triumph of the Will\", one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival. Goebbels and his ministry were involved in both the rally and the film production.\n\n[4] Propaganda in Nazi Germany: \"Triumph des Willens\" (\"Triumph of the Will\", 1935) by film-maker Leni Riefenstahl chronicled the Nazi Party Congress of 1934 in Nuremberg. It followed an earlier film of the 1933 Nuremberg Rally produced by Riefenstahl, \"Der Sieg des Glaubens\". \"Triumph of the Will\" features footage of uniformed party members (though relatively few German soldiers), who are marching and drilling to militaristic tunes. The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress, including Adolf Hitler. Frank Capra used scenes from the film, which he described partially as \"the ominous prelude of Hitler's holocaust of hate\", in many parts of the United States government's \"Why We Fight\" anti-Axis seven film series, to demonstrate what the personnel of the American military would be facing in World War II, and why the Axis had to be defeated.\n\n[5] Triumph of the Will: \"Triumph of the Will\" premiered on 28 March 1935 at the Berlin Ufa Palace Theater and was an instant success. Within two months the film had earned 815,000 Reichsmark, and Ufa considered it one of the three most profitable films of that year. Hitler praised the film as being an \"incomparable glorification of the power and beauty of our Movement.\" For her efforts, Riefenstahl was rewarded with the German Film Prize (\"Deutscher Filmpreis\"), a gold medal at the 1935 Venice Biennale, and the Grand Prix at the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris. However, there were few claims that the film would result in a mass influx of \"converts\" to fascism and the Nazis apparently did not make a serious effort to promote the film outside of Germany. Film historian Richard Taylor also said that \"Triumph of the Will\" was not generally used for propaganda purposes inside the Third Reich. \"The Independent\" wrote in 2003: \"\"Triumph of the Will\" seduced many wise men and women, persuaded them to admire rather than to despise, and undoubtedly won the Nazis friends and allies all over the world.\"\n\n[6] Joseph Goebbels: A major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a cult of personality. Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work. Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film \"Triumph of the Will\", one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by Leni Riefenstahl. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 Venice Film Festival. At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"\n\n[7] Leni Riefenstahl: In the 1930s, she directed \"Triumph des Willens\" (\"Triumph of the Will\") and \"Olympia\", resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim. The movies are widely considered two of the most effective, and technically innovative, propaganda films ever made. Her involvement in \"Triumph des Willens\", however, significantly damaged her career and reputation after the war. The exact nature of her relationship with Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler remains a matter of debate. However, Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films, and a closer friendship is claimed to have existed. When in 2000 Jodie Foster was planning a biographical drama on Riefenstahl, war-crime documenters warned against a revisionist view that glorified the director. They stated that publicly Riefenstahl seemed \"quite infatuated\" with Hitler and was in fact the last surviving member of his \"inner circle\". Others go further, arguing that Riefenstahl's visions were essential to the success of the Holocaust. After the war, Riefenstahl was arrested, but classified as being a \"fellow traveler\" or \"Nazi sympathiser\" only and was not associated with war crimes. Throughout her life, she denied having known about the Holocaust. Besides directing, Riefenstahl released an autobiography and wrote several books on the Nuba people.\n\n[8] The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl: Riefenstahl was best known for her documentary film \"Olympia\" (1938), on the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin and her Nazi propaganda films, \"Der Sieg des Glaubens\" (1933), \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935), and \"Tag der Freiheit\" (1935), which are regarded by historians as among the greatest propaganda films of all time.\n\n[9] Gladiator (2000 film): The film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda film \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the iconography of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. \"Gladiator\" reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred in Adolf Hitler's procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his chariot. The first thing to appear in \"Triumph of the Will\" is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene) leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.\n\n[10] Triumph of the Will: \"Triumph of the Will\" was released in 1935 and became a major example of film used as propaganda. Riefenstahl's techniques—such as moving cameras, aerial photography, the use of long focus lenses to create a distorted perspective, and the revolutionary approach to the use of music and cinematography—have earned \"Triumph of the Will\" recognition as one of the greatest propaganda films in history. Riefenstahl helped to stage the scenes, directing and rehearsing some of them at least fifty times. Riefenstahl won several awards, not only in Germany but also in the United States, France, Sweden and other countries. The film was popular in the Third Reich, and has continued to influence films, documentaries and commercials to this day. In Germany, the film is not censored but the courts commonly classify it as Nazi propaganda which requires an educational context to public screenings.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

At a meeting in November 2007 the Campaign reiterated its policy as formulated in the appeal.\n\n[2] Shankill Road bombing: At Begley's wake, a British soldier fired upon a group of mourners standing outside Begley's home. The soldier fired twenty shots from a passing Land Rover. Among those wounded was republican activist Eddie Copeland, who needed extensive surgery. The court heard that the soldiers had been shown a photograph of Copeland before being sent on patrol. The soldier who fired the shots, Trooper Andrew Clarke, was jailed for ten years for attempted murder. Begley was given a well-attended republican funeral in west Belfast. Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Féin, used \"unusually strong language\" in condemning the bombing, saying it was wrong and could not be excused. However, he was criticised for being a pall-bearer at Begley's funeral. David McKittrick and Eamonn Mallie wrote that if Adams had shunned the funeral it would have been \"the end of him as a republican leader\". They explain that it would have severely damaged his credibility within the republican movement and made it difficult for him to secure an IRA ceasefire. Others, such as Taoiseach Albert Reynolds and RUC Chief Constable Hugh Annesley, agreed with this view.\n\n[3] Q&amp;A (Australian talk show): On 25 October 2010, former Prime Minister John Howard had a pair of shoes thrown at him from a member of the audience due to responses on his attitude to the Iraq War. The shoe-thrower was subsequently removed from the audience. Although Howard seemed indifferent to the incident, it was criticised by both Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott, among other members of Parliament from both the Government and the Opposition. The shoe-thrower, environmental activist Peter Gray, died of cancer six months later; before he died, however, he asked the ABC to auction his shoes and the money to be donated to the Red Cross. Tony Jones announced the auction on the show on 9 May 2011, saying: \"Before he died he asked that the shoes, which we kept, be auctioned for charity and the money given to the International Committee for the Red Cross for its work in Iraq. Former Prime Minister John Howard has expressed sorrow at Mr Gray's death and endorsed this idea. So the shoes, which symbolise the their disagreement over Iraq, will now be used to provide practical help to people in Iraq.\" The auction was won by Volley for $3,650.\n\n[4] List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by age: Not all prime ministers live to become the oldest of their time. Of the 49 deceased prime ministers, 30 eventually became the oldest of their lifetime, while 19 did not (including 4 of the 7 prime ministers who died in office, Earl of Wilmington, Henry Pelham, and Viscount Palmerston being the only exceptions). Henry Addington became the oldest living prime minister when Duke of Grafton died in 1811 and remained so until his death in 1844, for a record of almost 33 years. Edward Heath became the oldest living prime minister after the death of James Callaghan, but he survived Callaghan by only 113 days. On two occasions the oldest living prime minister lost this distinction not by his death, but due to the appointment of a prime minister who was older. Robert Walpole lost this distinction when Earl of Wilmington was appointed, then a year later when Wilmington died in office Walpole regained it again until his own death in 1745 for a total period of 22 years, and 207 days. Earl of Rosebery lost it when Henry Campbell-Bannerman was appointed, but regained it again when Campbell-Bannerman died. Consequently, Rosebery too was the oldest living prime minister twice: first from 1903 to 1905 (after the death of Lord Salisbury), and a second time after Campbell-Bannerman's death in 1908 until his own death in 1929 for a total period of 23 years, and 134 days. Edward\n\n[5] Robert F. Kennedy: George Plimpton, former decathlete Rafer Johnson, and former professional football player Rosey Grier are credited with wrestling Sirhan to the ground after he shot the senator. As Kennedy lay mortally wounded, Juan Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, \"Is everybody OK?\", and Romero responded, \"Yes, everybody's OK.\" Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, \"Everything's going to be OK.\" After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted the senator onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, \"Don't lift me\", which were his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. He was rushed first to Los Angeles' Central Receiving Hospital, and then to the city's Good Samaritan Hospital. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. (PDT) on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting.\n\n[6] Prime Minister of Australia: Ben Chifley lived the least of all former prime ministers, as he died one year and six months after his term as prime minister. All other deceased former prime ministers have lived at least another 10 years, with the longest surviving former prime minister being Gough Whitlam, who lived 38 years and 11 months after office, surpassing Stanley Bruce's previous record of 37 years and 10 months.\n\n[7] Emily Chang (journalist): During her time in China, Chang reported on prominent stories including the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China's economic transformation and its environmental consequences, the 2008 floods of South China, the aftermath of the Sichuan earthquake, North Korea's nuclear ambitions and President Obama's historic visit to Asia. During Obama's visit to Shanghai, Chang was briefly detained by the police for her coverage of the banned \"Oba-mao\" T-shirt, which depicted the American President dressed in iconic Red Army attire. In London, Chang covered European and international events including the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. She had a one-on-one interview with Benazir Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan, weeks before her assassination.\n\n[8] Sharad Pawar: During the course of the 1991 election campaign, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. There were reports in the media that Pawar's name was being considered for the prime minister's post, along with those of P.V. Narasimha Rao and N.D. Tiwari, in the event of a Congress victory. However the Congress Parliamentary Party (party MPs) elected P.V. Narasimha Rao as its leader and he was sworn in as prime minister on 21 June 1991. Rao named Pawar as Defence Minister. On 26 June 1991, Pawar took over that portfolio, continuing till March 1993. After Pawar's successor in Maharashtra, Sudhakarrao Naik, stepped down, Rao sent Pawar back as chief minister of the state.\n\n[9] Prime Minister of the Netherlands: , there are three Prime Ministers of the Netherlands currently living, the oldest being Dries van Agt. The most recent former Prime Minister to die was Wim Kok who served 1994–2002 and died on 20 October 2018 at the age of .\n\n[10] Francisco Blake Mora: Blake Mora's last Twitter post before his death recalled the previous death of the former Secretary of Interior, Juan Camilo Mouriño:The question of whether this incident was a mere coincidence or a conspiracy has been discussed in numerous newspapers, blogs, and other internet sites. However, President Calderón has tried to quell any suggestions of sabotage, saying Blake Mora's helicopter \"was always under guard\" in the hangar of Mexico's equivalent of the Secret Service and that it had recently undergone maintenance. Before Blake Mora, Juan Camilo Mouriño, who was also head of the Interior, was killed in an airplane accident on November 4, 2008 with the presidential security adviser Jose Luis Vasconcelos and six other officials. And in September 21, 2005, Ramón Martín Huerta, the former Public Security Secretary, also died in a helicopter accident with José Antonio Bernal, who worked for the Human Rights Commission, Tomás Valencia, head chief of the Federal Police in Mexico, and six other officials. Although not proven, these high-profile deaths have fueled speculations on whether they were foul plays by the drug cartels.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease select one of the following contexts to answer the question:\n\n[1] Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly\n\n[2] Shankill Road bombing\n\n[3]", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Similar to the original \"Xenoblade\", the title was announced as \"Xenoblade 2\" in Japan, but had \"Chronicles\" added to its name in English speaking regions. The game was also a part of Nintendo's presentation at E3 2017, where it was reconfirmed for release by the end of 2017. Like the original \"Xenoblade Chronicles\", Nintendo's European division took up the reins for the English localization, who regularly communicated with Nintendo's Japanese and American divisions about decisions that could prove controversial, something that was previously an issue with \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". The game had a simultaneous worldwide launch on December 1, 2017, as the localization process took place during development rather than after it, unlike the first two games.\n\n[2] Xeno (series): Near the release date of \"Xenoblade Chronicles X,\" Takahashi stated that, if he were given the opportunity to make another game in the \"Xenoblade\" series, he would hope to create another traditional JRPG-style video game similar to \"Xenoblade Chronicles\". He stated that he hoped to continue the series by exploring many different settings instead of being confined to a specific genre. He also stated that he would like to use the core system set up in \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" to further expand on the story and thematic elements for their next project. Two years later, \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" was released which returned to the story-driven JRPG style found in \"Xenoblade Chronicles\".\n\n[3] Xeno (series): Xenoblade Chronicles currently spans three games: the original game (2010), spiritual successor \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" (2015), \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" (2017), and DLC \"\" (2018). The games employ an action-based battle system, incorporating cooldown abilities and quick-time commands. \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" also incorporates traversal using giant mechs known as Skells. While \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" adopts a story-driven design, \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" uses a non-linear structure within an open world. No direct story connection exist between \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" and \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". The Skells were also a deliberate callback to the Gears of \"Xenogears\". The \"Xenoblade\" series is owned by Nintendo.\n\n[4] Xenoblade Chronicles X: \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" was developed by Japanese development company Monolith Soft, with Tetsuya Takahashi forming the original concept and serving as the game's executive director. Following the completion of \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" for the Wii in 2011, Takahashi approached Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami and asked if he could develop a new science fiction-themed role-playing game built upon the systems of \"Xenoblade Chronicles\". Yamagami and Nintendo were willing, and talks turned towards what Takahashi and Monolith Soft could do on Nintendo's Wii U console. \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" directors Genki Yokota of Nintendo and Koh Kojima of Monolith Soft returning in their original roles. The producers were Shingo Kawabata of Monolith Soft and Hitoshi Yamagami of Nintendo. Discussions about how to realize \"Xenoblade Chronicle X\" went on for around six months. While planned for release early in the Wii U's life cycle, the planned release date was pushed forward due to development issues. They later commented that it was a challenge fitting the entire game onto a single Wii U game disc, with Kawabata commenting that the game \"barely fits\" onto the 32 gigabyte disc. \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" was Monolith Soft's first high-definition video game. To help cope with this first, the team decided against using cutting-edge technology when designing the game. The team used the lessons\n\n[5] Xenoblade Chronicles 2: The game is the third title in Monolith Soft's \"Xenoblade\" metaseries, following the original \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" and \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". Plans for the game began as early as July 2014, during the latter half of development of \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\", out of the negative fan reaction from changes implemented in the title. While the original \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" followed the typical structure of a general story-driven JRPG, \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" received far less emphasis on story, and was organized in more of a mission-based structure, focused primarily on exploring the game's open world. The development grew impatient upon hearing the fanbase complain about the changes, and started work on another story-driven title. Because the gameplay was more of a continuation of the first title, they decided to title it \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\". Initial work on the game was difficult because the technical specifications of the Nintendo Switch were not yet finalized or known yet, but once it was finalized, the game featured a shorter development period compared to the prior titles, with executive director Tetsuya Takahashi citing being able to use the technological foundation established in \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" as a means of speeding up development time. Another motivating factor was the agreement made by the team with Nintendo specifically to deliver the game \n\n[6] Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Development of \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" began shortly before the launch of \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". Several key people from previous \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" games returned including executive director and scenario writer Tetsuya Takahashi and directors Koh Kojima and Genki Yokota. Using their experience from \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\", the team wanted to develop a story-driven game in the style of the original \"Xenoblade Chronicles\". The soundtrack was composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, ACE, Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota. The main characters were drawn by Masatsugu Saito, best known for his work in \"Expelled from Paradise\" while Tetsuya Nomura designed the Tornan characters.\n\n[7] Xenoblade Chronicles: \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" sold nearly 200,000 units in Japan by the end of 2013. In a later interview, the game sold better in the west than it did in Japan. As of December 2015, \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" sold roughly 377,000 units between Japan, France, and the United States. \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" sold 1.42 million copies as of June 2018, which became the best-selling title ever developed by Monolith Soft. Its sales performance exceeded the company's expectations in western territories. \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country\" was also noted for surpassing their sales expectations in Japan as well.\n\n[8] Monolith Soft: During the last development stages of \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\", Monolith Soft began work on a new \"Xenoblade\" title for the Nintendo Switch. Titled \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\", the game returned to the story-driven structure of \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" while building upon the gameplay and technology of \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". One of the game's story prototypes was later turned into an expansion titled \"\", released in 2018. In addition to this, Monolith Soft also began development of a new fantasy-themed IP, hiring new staff for the project. The company opened new studios in Nakameguro and Iidabashi during 2017 and 2018. The 1st Production team, known for their work on the \"Xenoblade Chronicles\" series, started hiring staff for development of a new RPG project.\n\n[9] Xenoblade Chronicles X: The foundation work for \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\" provided a base architecture upon which the staff were able to build for the next \"Xeno\" game for the Nintendo Switch, resulting in a far shorter development time than previous \"Xenoblade\" titles. The next game, titled \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" and released worldwide on December 1, 2017, acts as a thematic sequel to \"Xenoblade Chronicles\", shifting back to a story-driven approach after the focus on gameplay for \"Xenoblade Chronicles X\". Elma was released as a \"Blade\" or sentient weapon for the expansion pass of \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\".\n\n[10] Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country: Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna – The Golden Country is an expansion pack released for the 2017 action role-playing video game \"Xenoblade Chronicles 2\" released in September 2018 by Monolith Soft.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [5].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The battle was one of the first engagements between the two forces during the war and occurred when A Company, 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) struck a Viet Cong bunker system defended by Company 238 in the Gang Toi Hills, in northern Bien Hoa Province. It occurred during a major joint US-Australian operation codenamed Operation Hump, involving the US 173rd Airborne Brigade, to which 1 RAR was attached. During the latter part of the operation an Australian rifle company clashed with an entrenched company-sized Viet Cong force in well-prepared defensive positions. Meanwhile, an American paratroop battalion was also heavily engaged in fighting on the other side of the Song Dong Nai.\n\n[2] Battle of Yancheng: Contemporary Song Dynasty historian and expert Wang Cengyu (王曾瑜) notes that: “The great battles of Yancheng and Yinchang took place during the wet months of June and July in the Central Plains area. Here the Jin cavalry showed off their speed and skill making the few victories achieved difficult for Yue Fei and his army.” and “Comparative evidence from the \"Zhuzi yulei\" regarding the battle at Zhu Xian shows that “Two separate parts of Yue Fei’s army marched from the approximate locations of Linying and Yingchang to Xiangbian Du (向汴都), when there is the strong probability that they attacked and slaughtered the Jin army at Zhuxian.”\n\n[3] Battle of Jiulianshan: Due to the previous loss of supplies in the November last year, the nationalists were forced to re-supply. On January 8, 1949, 5 infantry companies and one artillery companies of the nationalist 13th Security Regiment totaling 600 troops organized another convoy consisted of three boats of supplies went upstream again in Dongjiang River. The communist guerilla concentrated its 3rd Regiment, 5th Regiment, 7th Regiment and Independent 5th Group totaling 1,000 to ambush the convoy was when the nationalists were stopping at the riverbank. On January 11, 1949, after a nine-hour-long fierce battle that lasted from noon till 9:00 PM, the nationalists managed to successfully breakout, but all of the suppliers had lost to the enemy in addition to suffering over 190 fatalities. After this setback, the nationalists cancelled any further plans to eradicate the communist guerrilla and withdrew all of its deployed forces.\n\n[4] Battle of Chosin Reservoir: The Battle of Chosin Reservoir, also known as the Chosin Reservoir Campaign or the Battle of Jangjin Lake () was a battle in the Korean War. The name \"Chosin\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation \"\"Chōshin\"\", instead of the Korean pronunciation.\n\n[5] Jinzhou Operation: By the evening of December 31, 1931, the Japanese advance guard was fifteen kilometers from Jinzhou on the banks of the Taling river. General Tamon halted briefly to bring up the rest of his 2nd Division, for the final drive on Jinzhou. The Japanese War Office announced in a radio broadcast \"The Battle of the Taling River\", setting up microphones behind the Japanese lines, arranging an elaborate hookup to broadcast the sound of firing to Tokyo, but then had to call off the broadcast when the Chinese retreated without giving combat.\n\n[6] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[7] Royal Ulster Rifles: The Battle of the Imjin River began on 22 April 1951 with the goal of taking Seoul. By 25 April 1951, the Brigade was ordered to withdraw as the Communist forces were threatening to encircle it. With virtually no cover and seriously outnumbered, the Royal Ulster Rifles came under heavy fire as they withdrew to a blocking position. The Brigade was able to hold its position, despite fierce fighting, and neutralized the effectiveness of the Sixty-fourth Chinese Communist Army. Although the enemy's offensive had come within 5 miles of Seoul, the capital had been saved. At the time, the Times reported the Battle of Imjin River concluding with: \"The fighting 5th wearing St George and the Dragon and the Irish Giants with the Harp and Crown have histories that they would exchange with no one. As pride, sobered by mourning for fallen observes how well these young men have acquitted themselves in remotest Asia. The parts taken by the regiments may be seen as a whole. The motto of the Royal Ulster Rifles may have the last word Quis Separabit\" (who shall separate us).\n\n[8] History of gunpowder: Guns as well as other gunpowder weapons were used in abundance during the famous Battle of Lake Poyang which lasted from 30 August to 4 October 1363. There were at least a hundred vessels and approximately 500,000 combatants altogether involved, although traditional numbers have gone even higher. Poyang Lake was situated on a strategic location connecting the Yangtze with other river basins and in the early 1360s Zhu Yuanzhang held key garrisons on the lake, which he administered from Nanjing 560 kilometers downriver. Upstream was the state of Han (大漢; Pinyin: \"Dahan\", \"Great Han\") under Chen Youliang, who set out to wrest control of the lake from Zhu Yuanzhang. Chen's force consisted of \"tower ships\" designed for depositing soldiers on riverside city walls rather than waterborne combat, and the purpose of these ships was to capture the city of Nanchang, which guarded Lake Poyang from the south. This proved futile as the city defenders simply moved the walls back, and Chen was forced to personally lead an assault on the city gates, which was met with a counterattack with huochong (early Ming guns), and they were driven back. After this failure, Chen set up a blockade, determined to starve out the defenders, but a small fishing boat managed to slip out and reached Nanjing in time to warn Zhu Yuanzhang.\n\n[9] Battle of the Imjin River: The British Embassy in Seoul organises a service, officially called the Gloster Valley Memorial Service, for veterans on every anniversary of the battle. In 2008, it took place on 19 April as part of formal commemoration ceremonies that were held during 14–20 April. The outline of the commemorations in 2008 encompassed a service of commemoration, including the laying of wreaths and the presentations of Gloster Valley Scholarships – financial assistance to deserving children in the area where the battle took place – as well as a picnic lunch that offered visitors the opportunity to mingle with veterans. About 70 British veterans and the British ambassador to South Korea took part in the event. In the Battle of the Imjin River two Victoria Crosses and one George Cross were awarded to soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment:In addition, several soldiers were awarded the Distinguished Service Order:\n\n[10] Battle of Chinkiang: The Battle of Chinkiang was fought between British and Chinese forces in Chinkiang (Zhenjiang), Jiangsu province, China, on 21July 1842 during the First Opium War. It was the last major battle of the war. The Chinese force consisted of a garrison of Manchu and Mongol Bannermen. In command of the British forces was Sir Hugh Gough. Leading one brigade was future British field marshal Sir Colin Campbell. The British capture of this stronghold allowed them to proceed to Nanking. Fought near the confluence of the Grand Canal and Yangtze River, the battle effectively blocked operation of the Caoyun system, a transport network vital for the movement of grain throughout the empire. As a result, the Daoguang Emperor decided to sue for peace and agreed to sign the Treaty of Nanking, which brought hostilities to an end. Mass suicide was committed by the Manchu Bannermen who were defending the city.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease select one of the contexts and let me know which one you have chosen.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

African-American halfback Mel Groomes joined the Lions in 1948, as did African-American end Bob Mann. Mann and Greene, both University of Michigan alumni, led the Lions' receiving corps. Mann caught 33 passes for 560 yards in 1948, only 35 yards behind Greene. Wallace Triplett, an African-American player who joined the Lions in 1949, praised Greene for his leadership in welcoming the African-American players. Triplett recalled: \"I want to say 'thank you' to John because what we have now in the NFL would not have been possible had it not been for him and others like Bill Dudley. John was a star and a captain for the Lions. So, when he and Bill came over to me in the locker room, shook my hand and welcomed me to the Lions, it made a huge impact in my acceptance on the team and in the League. I will always appreciate what John and Bill did for me.\"\n\n[2] History of the Detroit Lions: After the season ended the Lions played a team of NFL All Stars in an exhibition game on January 1, 1936 and won in a 33–0 shutout. They also played 3 more exhibition games, a 67–14 win over the Westwood Clubs Los Angeles on January 13, a 42–7 win over the Los Angeles All Stars on January 20 and a 10–3 victory over the Green Bay Packers. Over the next two years Detroit finished a solid 8–4 and 7–4 but finished in 3rd in the Western Conference both years, again to the Bears and Packers. After falling one game short of the Packers in 1938 both Dutch Clark and Ernie Caddel decided to retire from professional football. Clark was later inducted into the Detroit Lions hall of fame and had his jersey number retired by the club.\n\n[3] Detroit Lions Cheerleaders: Since moving to Detroit from Portsmouth, Ohio in 1934, the Detroit Lions have only had one official cheerleading squad before the current one. The Detroit Lions original cheerleading squad formed in 1963 and continued until 1974. Promoters of cheer squads had contacted the team's front office several times only to be met with rejections. In August 2010, a group formed the Detroit Pride, which became the unofficial cheerleaders for the team.\n\n[4] History of the Detroit Lions: A 3–8–1 season in 1959 meant the Lions closed out their most successful decade in disappointing fashion and going into the 1960s the Lions decided to go with a new rebuild this time centered around defense. Detroit started by trading defensive end Gerry Perry to the St. Louis Cardinals for cornerback Dick \"Night Train\" Lane. Lions hall of famer Joe Schmidt later called it \"One of the greatest trades that will ever be made in any sport\". This was a good move as Lane made three Pro Bowls and four All Pro selections as a Lion. Detroit also drafted star defensive tackle Roger Brown to pair with Alex Karras, Sam Williams and Darris McCord, forming one of the most fierce defensive lines in pro football history. The Lions also still had 50's stars Joe Schmidt and Yale Lary as well as cornerback Dick LeBeau who the team signed in 1959. Despite a 0-3 start in 1960 This defense helped the Lions put together a 7–2 record to end the year at 7–5 overall. Detroit finished 2nd in the Western Conference and earned a trip to the Playoff Bowl against their rivals the Cleveland Browns who finished 2nd in the Eastern Conference.\n\n[5] History of the Detroit Lions: Detroit improved on that record in 1945 finishing 7–3, 2nd in the Western Division behind the Cleveland Rams. The Lions were less successful in the latter half of the decade; in 1946 Detroit only managed 1 win all year long and in 1947 only won 3. The Lions fortunes began turning around in 1948. With the 6th overall pick in the 1948 NFL Draft the Lions drafted quarterback Y.A. Tittle however he never signed with the team instead joining the San Francisco 49ers. In the same draft, three picks before the Lions drafted Tittle, the Chicago Bears drafted Bobby Layne, who built a hall of fame career in Detroit just three years later, and later Detroit picked up tackle Les Bingaman and defensive back Don Doll who became Pro Bowlers.\n\n[6] 1974 Detroit Lions season: The 1974 Detroit Lions season was the 45th season in franchise history. It was the Lions' final season playing at Tiger Stadium; the team moved to the Pontiac Silverdome the following season and played home games there until the end of their 2001 season. Prior to the start of training camp, tragedy would strike the Lions, as Head Coach Don McCafferty died of a fatal heart attack at age 53. He would later be replaced by Lions assistant Rick Forzano, who would guide the Lions to a 7–7 record in their final season at Tiger Stadium. This would also be the last season until 2011 when Monday Night Football would air in the city of Detroit as a result of the Lions playing in Pontiac from 1975 to 2001, following by sub par seasons while playing home games at Ford Field during its first eight years.\n\n[7] 1952 Detroit Lions season: The 1951 Lions had compiled a 7–4–1 record and finished in a tie for second place in the NFL National Conference. The 1952 team was a veteran group, including quarterback Bobby Layne (fifth year in NFL, third in Detroit), fullback Pat Harder (seventh year in NFL, second in Detroit), halfbacks Doak Walker (third year in NFL, all in Detroit) and Bob Hoernschemeyer (seventh year in NFL, third in Detroit), ends Cloyce Box (third year in NFL, all in Detroit) and Leon Hart (third year in NFL, all in Detroit), defensive linemen Les Bingaman (fifth year in NFL, all in Detroit), John Prchlik (fourth year in NFL, all in Detroit), Thurman \"Fum\" McGraw (third year in NFL, all in Detroit), and defensive backs Don Doll (fourth year in NFL, all in Detroit), Jack Christiansen (second year in NFL, both in Detroit), and Bob Smith (fifth year in pro ball, fourth in Detroit).\n\n[8] 1952 Detroit Lions season: The Detroit Lions season resulted in the Lions winning their second National Football League (NFL) championship, having won their first championship 17 years earlier in 1935. The team's co-captains were halfback Bob Hoernschemeyer and defensive tackle John Prchlik, and defensive end Jim Doran was selected as the team's most valuable player. In their third year under head coach Buddy Parker, the 1952 Lions compiled a 9–3 record during the regular season, finished in a tie with the Los Angeles Rams for first place in the NFL's National Conference, defeated the Rams in a tiebreaker game, and defeated the Cleveland Browns, 17–7, in the 1952 NFL Championship Game at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland.\n\n[9] History of the Detroit Lions: At the start of the 1933 season the Lions added star runningback Ernie Caddel to the roster but despite a strong 5-1 start the team fell apart in the second half of the season finishing 1–4 for a final record of 6-5 which was only good for the second spot in the Western Conference. After the season the financially struggling Spartans were purchased by a group led by Detroit radio executive George Richards for $7,952.08 and moved to Detroit where they were renamed the Detroit Lions. Richards chose the name as a nod to the Detroit Tigers and because he said the Lion is the monarch of the jungle and he wanted his team to be the monarch of the NFL.\n\n[10] History of the Detroit Lions: In the mid-1960s, the Lions served as the backdrop for the sports literature of George Plimpton, who spent time in the Lions training camp masquerading as a player. This was the basic material for his book \"Paper Lion\", later made into a movie starring Alan Alda plus a number of actual Lions players, including Alex Karras. On November 22, 1963, William Clay Ford, Sr. purchased a controlling interest in the team for $4.5 million. During Ford's ownership tenure which extended to his death in 2014, the Lions won just a single playoff game. Detroit's luck came to an end in 1963 as the team fell apart finishing 5–8–1 a betting scandal involving Alex Karras and Packers runningback Paul Hornung led to both players being suspended for the 1963 season and also played a part in the Lions collapse. The Lions improved the next year finishing 7–5–2 but missed the playoffs.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat year was the Detroit Lions team formed?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

To the north of Issaquah is Lake Sammamish. Cougar and Squak Mountains are home to sizable neighborhoods, though the bulk of all three mountains are preserved in public ownership as Squak Mountain State Park, Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park, West Tiger Mountain NRCA, and Tiger Mountain State Forest. Geologists have noted the chemical and geological content of these three mountains to be much different than that of the Cascade Range, simply because they are not volcanic in origin, while the entire Cascade Range is postulated to have formed from volcanic action. They believe that these three mountains are the remains of a much older mountain range long since eroded by earthquakes, volcanic action, and shifting plates.\n\n[2] Issaquah Alps Trails Club: The IATC has had a few setbacks from developers (notably Grand Ridge on the Sammamish Plateau) but overall they have been greatly instrumental in getting King County and local communities to set aside much of the Alps for recreational use. The club is now working with the Snoqualmie Valley Trails Club to advocate land management for the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway.Manning, Harvey. \"The Authoritative Guide to the Hiking Trails of Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park and Surrounds (Foreword).\" Issaquah Alps Trails Club, Issaquah, Washington, 2000.\n\n[3] Shannon Phillips: On January 5, 2019, following alleged bullying and intimidation of the proposed Bighorn Wildland Provincial Park supporters, Minister Phillips issued a statement announcing that public consultations that were planned for Drayton Valley, Edmonton, Red Deer, and Sundre, would be cancelled and with announcements of alternative consultations. The Bighorn Wildland Provincial Park is a proposed provincial park that would be situated near Rocky Mountain House. The proposed area to be set is \"about the size of Rhode Island\" and is the largest of four proposals for \"new or expanded\" parks. The proposed region, situated between Banff National Park and Jasper National Park , would provide a vast and critical wildlife corridor for numerous wildlife species, including sensitive species, such as bull trout—Alberta’s provincial fish, wolverine, and grizzly bears, that would extend from Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming in the south to the Yukon in Northern Canada. According to a January 7, 2019 article in \"The Globe and Mail\", some residents of Rocky Mountain House, a town of 7,000, led by United Conservative Party (UCP) Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta (MLA) for Rimbey-Rocky Mountain House-Sundre, Jason Nixon, oppose the creation of the park. Nixon has made unfounded claims that the plan is a \"foreign-funded plot to wall off the back country to Albertans who call the region home\".\n\n[4] Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park: The park is bordered on the north by the Lakemont neighborhood in the city of Bellevue and on the northeast by the city of Issaquah. The park is bounded on the east by the 260-acre Talus Open Space. State Route 900 forms the southeastern border. Neighboring Squak Mountain looms to the southeast and the farms of May Creek valley lie to the south. To the southwest is the city of Renton. The city of Newcastle, ranging over the Newport Hills occupies the western portion of Cougar Mountain, with several smaller parcels designated the China Creek Open Space abutting the park on the west and housing surrounding the Newcastle Golf Club directly to the west. To the northwest of the Red Town Trailhead is the deep gully of Coal Creek, with its own separate park, the Coal Creek Natural Area managed by the City of Bellevue which divides Newcastle from Bellevue. A 4-1/2 mile trail through the latter continues down to I-405. The park is fully within the Mountains to Sound Greenway.The hilltops of Cougar Mountain form a rough horseshoe-shape around the Klondike Marsh headwaters of Coal Creek, which runs northwest to Lake Washington through Coal Creek Park. Long Marsh Creek, Far Country Creek, Cabbage Creek, and Wilderness Creek are tributaries of May Creek, draining the south side of Cougar Mountain to Lake Washington.

It is located near the border of the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park. The zoo focuses on endangered species including lemurs from Madagascar, Bengal tigers, and endangered birds from various parts of the world. It was founded in 1972 by Peter and Marcie Rittler who operated it admission-free for its first 15 years. In 1990, the founders donated it to the Zoological Society of Washington which assumed the zoo's management and fundraising endeavors. As of 2009, Peter Rittler continued in the zoo's management.\n\n[6] Alberta Environment and Parks: The Bighorn Wildland Provincial Park is a proposed provincial park that would be situated near Rocky Mountain House.

All that is left from that era are a few concrete pads, landscaping features, a deteriorating chain-link fence, and an interpretive sign. Current amenities include restrooms, picnic tables, a playfield, wildlife interpretive signs, and access to the great trail system. The radar site supporting these missiles was located on Anti-Aircraft Peak one mile to the northeast where another interpretive sign provides more history of the site.\n\n[8] Cougar Mountain: Cougar Mountain is a peak in the Issaquah Alps in King County, Washington. It is part of the highlands in the Eastside suburbs of Seattle, and is the lowest and westernmost of the Alps. About two-thirds of Cougar Mountain has experienced residential development, and is home to many neighborhood communities such as Lakemont, but the forested heart of the hill was officially preserved by King County in June 1983 as Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park. Cougar Mountain is also home to the Cougar Mountain Zoo.\n\n[9] Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park: Among other smaller trailheads which provide on-street parking and access directly or via connecting trails to the park trail system are the following:\n\n[10] Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park: Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park is a regional park in King County, Washington, near the towns of Bellevue and Issaquah.

Its articles included “The White House Staff vs. the Cabinet,” “What Happens to a Senator’s Day,” and “The Data Game.” Among the authors were such journalists as David Broder, Murray Kempton, Russell Baker, and Calvin Trillin, as well as people who had worked in government, such as Peters, former White House aide Bill Moyers, and former U.S. Senate aide James Boyd. A similar mix of authors would continue to write for the magazine, but beginning in 1970, the magazine became largely the product of young unknowns, who would typically serve as writer-editors for two years. Among them were Taylor Branch, Suzannah Lessard, James Fallows, Walter Shapiro, Michael Kinsley, David Ignatius, Nicholas Lemann, Gregg Easterbrook, Mickey Kaus, Joe Nocera, Jonathan Alter, Timothy Noah, Steve Waldman, Matt Cooper, Jason DeParle, James Bennet, Katherine Boo, and Jon Meacham. One author characterizes Peters and the magazine as important influences on radical centrist political thought.\n\n[2] Disc (magazine): In 1966, it was incorporated with \"Music Echo\" magazine, which had itself previously taken over \"Mersey Beat\". The new magazine was known as \"Disc and Music Echo\" (with the name \"Disc\" shown more prominently on the masthead), from 23 April 1966. Unlike the other weekly magazines of the time, it featured colour photos on its front and back pages. According to journalist Jon Savage, it featured \"bang-up-to-the-minute news stories on the front page, race-track-style chart rundowns ... a contentious readers' postbag... and incisive singles reviews by the great Penny Valentine\". In June 1966, it was the first magazine to feature, in colour, the notorious \"butcher\" cover for the Beatles' US album \"Yesterday and Today\", under the headline \"Beatles: What a Carve-up!\"\n\n[3] Chicago: What would become the influential \"Poetry\" magazine was founded in 1912 by Harriet Monroe, who was working as an art critic for the \"Chicago Tribune\". The magazine discovered such poets as Gwendolyn Brooks, James Merrill, and John Ashbery. T. S. Eliot's first professionally published poem, \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", was first published by \"Poetry\". Contributors have included Ezra Pound, William Butler Yeats, William Carlos Williams, Langston Hughes, and Carl Sandburg, among others. The magazine was instrumental in launching the Imagist and Objectivist poetic movements. From the 1950s through 1970s, American poetry continued to evolve in Chicago. In the 1980s, a modern form of poetry performance began in Chicago, the Poetry Slam.\n\n[4] Sunday magazine: In 1869, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" published what is regarded as the first Sunday magazine, and the \"Chicago Inter Ocean\" added color to its supplement. \"The New York Times Magazine\" was published on September 6, 1896, and it contained the first photographs ever printed in that newspaper. During the 1890s, publications were inserted into Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" and William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\". Hearst had the eight-page \"Women's Home Journal\" and the 16-page \"Sunday American Magazine\", which later became \"The American Weekly\". In November 1896, Morrill Goddard, editor of the \"New York Journal\" from 1896 to 1937, launched Hearst's Sunday magazine, later commenting, \"Nothing is so stale as yesterday's newspaper, but \"The American Weekly\" may be around the house for days or weeks and lose none of its interest.\"\n\n[5] Astronomy (magazine): \"Astronomy\" was founded in 1973 by Stephen A. Walther, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point and amateur astronomer. The first issue, August 1973, consisted of 48 pages with five feature articles and information about what to see in the sky that month. Issues contained astrophotos and illustrations created by astronomical artists. Walther had worked part time as a planetarium lecturer at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and developed an interest in photographing constellations at an early age. Although even in childhood he was interested to obsession in Astronomy, he did so poorly in mathematics that his mother despaired that he would ever be able to earn a living. However he graduated in Journalism from the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, and as a senior class project he created a business plan for a magazine for amateur astronomers. With the help of his brother David, he was able to bring the magazine to fruition.. He died in 1977.\n\n[6] Dig (magazine): \"Dig\" was founded in 1999. It had its headquarters in Peterborough, New Hampshire. In 2001 the magazine was acquired by Cobblestone Publishing. The magazine was published several times per year. Each issue is 48 pages, and most of the issues were theme-based, on archaeological finds from various countries. It illustrated what archaeologists have found, and also explored the cultural, scientific, and architectural accomplishments of the societies that left these artifacts. Themes included \"Who Were the First Americans?\" in April 2007, and \"Australia: Land of the Unknown\" (April 2006), and \"Machu Piccu\" (Nov. 2005). In other issues, the theme might be a broad cultural constant between several ancient civilizations. Examples of this included \"For the Love of Money\" in March 2007, \"Disaster\" in Feb. 2007, and \"High Fashion\" in May 2006.\n\n[7] Thomas Paine: Before Paine's arrival in America, sixteen magazines had been founded in the colonies and ultimately failed, each featuring substantial content and reprints from England. In late 1774, Philadelphia printer Robert Aitken announced his plan to create what he called an \"American Magazine\" with content derived from the colonies. Paine contributed two pieces to the magazine's inaugural issue in February 1775, and Aitken hired Paine as the Magazine's editor one month later. Under Paine's leadership, the magazine's readership rapidly expanded, achieving a greater circulation in the colonies than any American magazine up until that point. While Aiken had conceived of the magazine as nonpolitical, Paine brought a strong political perspective to its content, writing in its first issue that \"every heart and hand seem to be engaged in the interesting struggle for \"American Liberty.\"\"\n\n[8] Open science: The first popular science periodical of its kind was published in 1872, under a suggestive name that is still a modern portal for the offering science journalism: Popular Science. The magazine claims to have documented the invention of the telephone, the phonograph, the electric light and the onset of automobile technology. The magazine goes so far as to claim that the \"history of Popular Science is a true reflection of humankind's progress over the past 129+ years\". Discussions of popular science writing most often contend their arguments around some type of \"Science Boom\". A recent historiographic account of popular science traces mentions of the term \"science boom\" to Daniel Greenberg's Science and Government Reports in 1979 which posited that \"Scientific magazines are bursting out all over. Similarly, this account discusses the publication Time, and its cover story of Carl Sagan in 1980 as propagating the claim that popular science has \"turned into enthusiasm\". Crucially, this secondary accounts asks the important question as to what was considered as popular \"science\" to begin with. The paper claims that any account of how popular science writing bridged the gap between the informed masses and the expert scientists must first consider who was considered a scientist to begin with.\n\n[9] First Statement: What began as a mimeographed publication of a few stapled sheets grew within three years into a larger magazine of tentatively national significance (it had editorial representatives in Vancouver although its core circulation was small—about 75 copies per issue). A year into its history, Canadian poets Louis Dudek and Irving Layton joined the magazines editorial board; both would go on to become major figures in Canadian literature. The so-called First Statement Group aligned itself with the cosmopolitan aesthetic in Canadian poetry, drawing inspiration from such \"avant-garde\" American poets as Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. This placed the editorial policy of \"First Statement\" somewhat in opposition with that of \"Preview\", which tended to favour such British anti-modernists as W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas. Despite these differences, the rivalry between the two magazines was never strong, and A. M. Klein, F. R. Scott, and other important poets published in both periodicals.\n\n[10] History of removal of leg and underarm hair in the United States: The Delineator, first published in 1873, was the first women's magazine. Five others appeared soon after, comprising what became known as the \"Big Six\": Ladies' Home Journal, Woman's Home Companion, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, and Pictorial Review. The publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, Cyrus Curtis, told advertisers that the purpose of the magazine was to give manufacturers a way to market their products to women, not for the benefit of American women. The goal of advertisers was to not only fulfill women's needs; it was to create new ones. The amount of advertising for toiletries and beauty services were second only to advertisements for food. Estimated advertising spends between 1890 and 1914 grew from $190 million to $682 million.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\n\nNo answer is present in the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The first ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun was obtained in 1946, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962. An orbiting solar telescope was launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of the Ariel space program, and in 1966 NASA launched the first Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) mission. OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by OAO-2, which carried out ultraviolet observations of stars and galaxies from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.\n\n[2] Sun: One of the most important solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by the European Space Agency and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun. All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.\n\n[3] SOLAR (ISS): SOLAR is an ESA science observatory on the Columbus Laboratory, which is part of the International Space Station. SOLAR was launched with Columbus on February 2008 aboard STS-122. It was externally mounted to Columbus with the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF). SOLAR has three main space science instruments: SOVIM, SOLSPEC and SOL-ACES. Together they provide detailed measurements of the Sun's spectral irradiance. The SOLAR platform and its instruments are controlled from the Belgian User Support and Operations Centre (B.USOC), located at the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BISA) in Uccle, Belgium.The mission was originally planned for a 2003 launch, but was delayed following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Some other components are also planned to be mounted externally on Columbus on future missions, including the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES). Another name for SOLAR may be Solar Monitoring Observatory or SMO.\n\n[4] Coronal loop: Many strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, MLSO, in Hawaii) and eclipse observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the Earth's atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) Aerobee rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, spectrograms measured solar EUV and Lyman-α emissions. Basic X-ray observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The British Skylark rocket missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray spectrometer data. Although successful, the rocket missions were very limited in lifetime and payload. During the period of 1962–1975, the satellite series Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-1 to OSO-8) were able to gain extended EUV and X-ray spectrometer observations. Then, in 1973, Skylab was launched and began a new multi-wavelength campaign that typified future observatories. This mission lasted only a year and was superseded by the Solar Maximum Mission, which became the first observatory to last the majority of a solar cycle (from 1980 to 1989). A wealth of data was accumulated across the whole range of emission.\n\n[5] Argentina: Space research has also become increasingly active in Argentina. Argentine built satellites include LUSAT-1 (1990), Víctor-1 (1996), PEHUENSAT-1 (2007), and those developed by CONAE, the Argentine space agency, of the SAC series. Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company INVAP, which provides several countries with nuclear reactors. Established in 1991, the CONAE has since launched two satellites successfully and, in June 2009, secured an agreement with the European Space Agency for the installation of a 35-m diameter antenna and other mission support facilities at the Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's foremost cosmic ray observatory. The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock\n\n[6] Vostochny Cosmodrome: The new cosmodrome is to enable Russia to launch most missions from its own land, and to reduce Russia's dependency on the Baikonur Cosmodrome which is leased from the government of Kazakhstan. Currently, Baikonur is the only launch site operated by Russia with the capability to launch crewed missions to ISS or elsewhere. The Russian government pays a yearly rent of $115 million to Kazakhstan for its usage. Satellites bound for geostationary orbit and high inclination orbits can be currently launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia. The new site is intended mostly for civilian launches. Roscosmos plans to move 45% of Russia's space launches to Vostochny by 2020, while Baikonur's share will drop from 65% to 11%, and Plesetsk will account for 44 percent. In 2012, the share of space launches from Russia's territory stood at 25%. By 2030 this figure is projected to increase to 90%. A more recent related opinion piece from Ars Technica pointed out that while Russia had roughly half of the commercial launch market in 2015, SpaceX launched more commercial payloads in 2017 than Russia. The author further speculated that the track record of SpaceX in cutting launch costs and continually improving rocket designs may make future Russian rockets uneconomical in spite of efforts at new designs.\n\n[7] Comparison of Asian national space programs: China has a space program with an independent human spaceflight capability. It has developed a sizable family of successful Long March rockets. It has launched two lunar orbiters, Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2. On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with Chang'e 3 Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so. It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned space station, starting with the launch of Tiangong 1 and followed by Tiangong 2 in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter (Yinghuo-1) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the 2020 Chinese Mars Mission with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020. China has collaborative projects with Russia, ESA, and Brazil, and has launched commercial satellites for other countries. Some analysts suggest that the Chinese space program is linked to the nation's efforts at developing advanced military technology.\n\n[8] Chinese space program: According to the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) presentation at the 2015 International Space Development Congress in Toronto, Canada, Chinese interest in space-based solar power began in the period 1990–1995. By 2011 there was a proposal for a national program, with advocates such as Pioneer Professor Wang Xiji stating in an article for the Ministry of Science and technology that \"China had built up a solid industrial foundation, acquired sufficient technology and had enough money to carry out the most ambitious space project in history. Once completed, the solar station, with a capacity of 100MW, would span at least one square kilometre, dwarfing the International Space Station and becoming the biggest man-made object in space\" and \"warned that if it did not act quickly, China would let other countries, in particular the US and Japan, take the lead and occupy strategically important locations in space.\" Global Security cites a 2011-01 Journal of Rocket propulsion that articulates the need for 620+ launches of their Long March-9 (CZ-9) heavy lift system for the construction of an orbital solar power plant with 10,000 MW capacity massing 50,000 tonnes.\n\n[9] Solar and Heliospheric Observatory: The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is a spacecraft built by a European industrial consortium led by Matra Marconi Space (now Astrium) that was launched on a Lockheed Martin Atlas II AS launch vehicle on December 2, 1995 to study the Sun. SOHO has also discovered over 3,000 comets. It began normal operations in May 1996. It is a joint project of international cooperation between the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. Originally planned as a two-year mission, \"SOHO\" continues to operate after over 20 years in space: the mission is extended until the end of 2020 with a likely extension until 2022.\n\n[10] Marshall Space Flight Center: Shortly after NASA was formed, the Orbiting Solar Observatory was launched, and was followed by the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) that carried out ultraviolet observations of stars between 1968 and 1972. These showed the value of space-based astronomy, and led to the planning of the Large Space Telescope (LST) that would be launched and maintained from the forthcoming space shuttle. Budget limitations almost killed the LST, but the astronomy community – especially Lyman Spitzer – and the National Science Foundation pressed for a major program in this area. Congress finally funded LST in 1978, with an intended launch date of 1983.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhich country has planned to launch a new space-based solar observatory?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "No, answer is not present.

On his mother's side were three noteworthy singers, two pipers, and a village bard. Of especial note was MacLean's paternal grandmother, Mary Matheson, whose family had been evicted from Lochalsh in the 18th century. Until her death in 1923, she lived with the family and taught MacLean many traditional songs from Kintail and Lochalsh, as well as Skye. As a child, MacLean enjoyed fishing trips with his aunt Peigi, who taught him other songs. Unlike other members of his family, MacLean could not sing, a fact that he connected with his impetus to write poetry.\n\n[2] Sorley MacLean: Before he went to university, MacLean was writing in both English and Gaelic. After writing a Gaelic poem, \"A' Chorra-ghritheach\" (\"The Heron\"), in 1932, he decided to write only in Gaelic and burned his earlier poems. MacLean later said, \"I was not one who could write poetry if it did not come to me in spite of myself, and if it came, it had to come in Gaelic\". However, it is also clear from his correspondence with MacDiarmid that his choice was also motivated by his determination to preserve and develop the Gaelic language. The Gaelic language had been in decline for several centuries; the 1931 census registered 136,135 Gaelic speakers in Scotland, only 3% of the Scottish population. Despite his decision to write in the language, at times MacLean doubted that Gaelic would survive and his poetry would be appreciated.\n\n[3] Sorley MacLean: In 1956, MacLean was offered the position of head teacher of Plockton High School in Wester Ross, not far from where his paternal grandmother's family had lived. It was a difficult assignment as the remote location was not attractive to teacher candidates, and MacLean frequently had to teach himself due to vacancies. While at Plockton, he promoted the use of Scottish Gaelic in formal education and campaigned for a Highers exam for learners of Gaelic. Before 1968, there was no separate exam for Gaelic learners, who had to compete with native speakers if they took Gaelic Highers. MacLean felt that this unfair policy discouraged many students from studying Gaelic, although he encouraged his students to take the exam even if they were not native speakers. In 1966, he presented a paper to the Gaelic Society of Inverness outlining the practical issues in Gaelic education. MacLean pointed out that in continental Europe, it was not uncommon to study three or four languages in school. According to MacLean, Scottish children would benefit from studying three languages in school alongside English, and \"surely it is not expecting too much of Gaelic patriotism to demand that Gaelic should be one of the three?\" MacLean set high academic expectations for his students and also promoted shinty; in 1965, the Plockton team won the cup for Ross and Cromarty.\n\n[4] Sorley MacLean: He was educated at Raasay Primary School and Portree Secondary School. In 1929, he left home to attend the University of Edinburgh. For economic reasons, he chose to study English instead of Celtic. He disliked the head of the English department, Herbert Grierson, who favoured different poets than MacLean; MacLean felt that Grierson imposed his aesthetic preferences on the department. MacLean's academic work has been described as merely \"dutiful\". While at Edinburgh, MacLean also took classes in the Celtic department, then under William J. Watson. He was involved in left-wing politics, literary circles, and the university shinty team. MacLean later described an occasion in which he had demonstrated against Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. According to Celtic scholar Emma Dymock, MacLean's education at Edinburgh broadened his horizons and the city itself was significant in his life. While in Edinburgh, he observed urban poverty, slums, and overcrowding, especially severe due to the Great Depression. After his graduation in 1933 with a first-class degree, rather than pursuing postgraduate studies he remained in Edinburgh and spent a year at Moray House Teachers' Training College, where he met Hugh MacDiarmid.\n\n[5] Dàin do Eimhir: Because of his socialist convictions, Sorley MacLean wanted to fight in the Spanish Civil War, but was prevented by family circumstances. In 1937, MacLean, then working as an English teacher at Portree High School, met and fell in love with Nessa O’Shea, an Irish woman whom he believed to be romantically involved with a friend; MacLean did not approach her and she later married someone else. She inspired the poem \"An Roghainn\" (Dàin do Eimhir XXII) in which the narrator chooses between a love interest and going to fight in Spain. Later, he went to teach on Mull, where the devastation from nineteenth-century clearances—in which many MacLeans had been evicted—had a profound effect on him. MacLean later said that \"I believe Mull had much to do with my poetry: its physical beauty, so different from Skye’s, with the terrible imprint of the clearances on it, made it almost intolerable for a Gael.\" This period of his life has been described as \"an immensely creative anguish\", because it led to the writing of the Eimhir cycle and \"An Cuilthionn\". He wrote most of the poetry that would become \"Dàin do Eimhir\" while teaching at Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, and in Hawick between 1939 and 1941.\n\n[6] Sorley MacLean: MacLean returned to Britain for convalescence in March 1943. He was discharged from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in August 1943 and released from the army in September. In the fall of 1943, he resumed teaching at Boroughmuir, where he met Renee Cameron in 1944. They married on 24 July 1946 in Inverness and had three daughters and six grandchildren. According to friends, their marriage was happy and peaceful, as they complemented each other well, and MacLean \"mellowed\" with age and family life. He had never been a member of the Communist Party, and the Soviet occupation of Poland after the war caused MacLean to become disillusioned with the Soviet Union and Stalinism. He retained his socialist world-view and strong belief in social justice. During this period, he frequently reviewed poetry and continued to make friends in literary circles, including younger poets such as Iain Crichton Smith and George Mackay Brown. He became particularly close to Sydney Goodsir Smith, who shared a flat with MacLean and his family for more than a year. In 1947 he was promoted to Principal Teacher of English at Boroughmuir, but MacLean wanted to return to the western Highlands.\n\n[7] Sorley MacLean: MacLean's many friends and visitors commented on his prodigious knowledge and deep interest in genealogy and local history. He continued to participate in left-wing politics, eventually joining the Scottish Labour Party. During his later years, he published few poems due to his \"concern with quality and authenticity over quantity\"; his family responsibilities and career left him little spare time to write. MacLean said that he had burned his poetry instead of publishing it because of his \"long years of grinding school-teaching and [his] addiction to an impossible lyric ideal\". After his retirement in 1972, MacLean moved to his great-grandmother's house at Peinnachorrain in Braes on Skye, with views over the Sound of Raasay, where he entertained frequently. Following the English publication of his poetry, he began be in demand internationally for poetry readings, for which he traveled to such places as Rotterdam, Baddeck Cape Breton, and Berlin. MacLean was writer in residence at the University of Edinburgh from 1973 to 1975, where he reportedly kept an open door and warm welcome for aspiring Gaelic poets. Later, he was the first \"filidh\" at the recently founded Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Gaelic-medium university on Skye, from 1975 to 1976. He was involved in founding the institution and also served on its board. In 1993, his daughter Catrìona died at the age of 41; MacLean and his wife helped to raise\n\n[8] Sorley MacLean: Sorley MacLean was born at Òsgaig on the island of Raasay on 26 October 1911; Scottish Gaelic was his first language. Before he went to school at the age of six, he spoke very little English. He was the second of five sons born to Malcolm (1880–1951) and Christina MacLean (1886–1974). The family owend a small croft and ran a tailoring business, but they later gave up the croft to move to a better house, which proved detrimental to their finances when the Great Depression took a high toll on the tailoring business. His brothers were John Maclean (1910–1970), a schoolteacher and later rector of Oban High School, who was also a piper; Calum Maclean (1915–1960), a noted folklorist and ethnographer; and Alasdair (1918–1999) and Norman (c.1917–c.1980), who became general practitioners. Sorley's two younger sisters, Isobel and Mary, were also schoolteachers. His patronymic was Somhairle mac Chaluim 'ic Chaluim 'ic Iain 'ic Tharmaid 'ic Iain 'ic Tharmaid; he could not trace his genealogy with certainty to the eighth generation.\n\n[9] Sorley MacLean: In 1934, he returned to Skye to teach English at Portree High School. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, he considered volunteering to fight in the International Brigades; according to his daughter, he would have gone if not for family responsibilities. At the time, his mother was seriously ill and his father's business was failing. In January 1938, MacLean accepted a teaching position at Tobermory High School on Mull, where he stayed until December. The year he spent on Mull had a profound effect on him, because Mull was still devastated from nineteenth-century clearances in which many MacLeans had been evicted. MacLean later said, \"I believe Mull had much to do with my poetry: its physical beauty, so different from Skye’s, with the terrible imprint of the clearances on it, made it almost intolerable for a Gael.\" He believed that fascism was likely to emerge victorious in Europe, and was further dismayed by the continuing decline of the Gaelic language.\n\n[10] Sorley MacLean: He was raised in a strict Presbyterian family on the island of Raasay, immersed in Gaelic culture and literature from birth, but abandoned religion for socialism. In the late 1930s, he befriended many Scottish Renaissance figures, such as Hugh MacDiarmid and Douglas Young. He was wounded three times while serving with the British Army during the Second World War. MacLean published little after the war, due to his perfectionism. In 1956, he became head teacher at Plockton High School, where he advocated for the use of the Gaelic language in formal education.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhere did Sorley MacLean go to school?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

In 2008, 10% of births were to teenage girls, and 14% were to women ages 35 and older. In the United States, a study found that the average woman spends 5 years working and building a career before having children, and mothers working non-salary jobs began having children at age 27, compared to mothers with salary positions, who became pregnant at age 31. The study shows that the difference in age of child birth is related to education, since the longer a woman has been in school, the older she will be when she enters the workforce.\n\n[2] Child marriage: As with the United States, underage cohabitation is observed in the United Kingdom. According to a 2005 study, 4.1% of all girls in the 15–19 age group in the UK were cohabiting (living in an informal union), while 8.9% of all girls in that age group admitted to having been in a cohabitation relation (child marriage per UNICEF definition), before the age of 18. Over 4% of all underage girls in the UK were teenage mothers.\n\n[3] National Insurance number: People born and resident in the UK are assigned a Child Reference Number shortly after birth when a claim is made for Child Benefit. At age 15 years 9 months HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) notifies each child of their NI number.\n\n[4] Child marriage: Lower legally allowed marriage age does not necessarily cause high rates of child marriages. However, there is a correlation between restrictions placed by laws and the average age of first marriage. In the United States, per 1960 Census data, 3.5% of girls married before the age of 16, while an additional 11.9% married between 16 and 18. States with lower marriage age limits saw higher percentages of child marriages. This correlation between higher age of marriage in civil law and observed frequency of child marriages breaks down in countries with Islam as the state religion. In Islamic nations, many countries do not allow child marriage of girls under their civil code of laws. But, the state recognized Sharia religious laws and courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code, and often do. UNICEF reports that the top five nations in the world with highest observed child marriage rates – Niger (75%), Chad (72%), Mali (71%), Bangladesh (64%), Guinea (63%) – are Islamic majority countries.\n\n[5] British Iron Age: Population estimates vary but the number of people in Iron Age Great Britain could have been three or four million by the first century BC, with most concentrated densely in the agricultural lands of the South. Settlement density and a land shortage may have contributed to rising tensions during the period. The average life expectancy at birth would have been around 25, but at the age of five it would have been around 30. These figures would be slightly lower for women, and slightly higher for men throughout the Middle Iron Age in most areas, on account of the high mortality rate of young women during childbirth; however, the average age for the two sexes would be roughly equal for the Late Iron Age. This interpretation depends on the view that warfare and social strife increased in the Late Iron Age, which seems to be fairly well attested in the archaeological record, for Southern Britain at least.\n\n[6] Advanced maternal age: In the USA, the average age at which women bore their first child advanced from 21.4 years old in 1970 to 26.6 in 2016.\n\n[7] Virginity: Some studies suggest that people commence sexual activity at an earlier age than previous generations. However, the 2005 Durex Global sex survey found that people worldwide are having sex for the first time at an average age of 17.3, ranging from 15.6 in Iceland to 19.8 in India (though evidence has shown that the average age is not a good indicator of sexual initiation, and that percentages of sexually initiated youth at each age are preferred). A 2008 survey of UK teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17 (conducted by YouGov for Channel 4), showed that only 6% of these teenagers intended to wait until marriage before having sex. According to a 2011 CDC study, in the 15-to-19-year-old age group 43 percent of males and 48 percent of females in the United States reported never having an opposite-sex partner.\n\n[8] WAVE Trust: The charity's reports and articles particularly emphasise the importance of warm, nurturing, loving parenting in the first 18 months of life when the emotional brain is largely created, and juxtaposes this with statistics showing that age 0-1 is the peak age for physical abuse in the UK. The people most likely to die a violent death are babies under 1 year old, who are four times more likely to be killed than the average person in England and Wales.\n\n[9] Age of consent reform in the United Kingdom: According to a recent British research conducted by the Centre for Family and Household Research, \"an increasing proportion of young people are sexually active below the age of consent\". Additionally, the UK's first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL), which collected data up to 1990, found that a high proportion of young people engage in other forms of sexual activity prohibited by the law, including mutual masturbation and oral sex, beginning on average at the age of 14.\n\n[10] Marriage: The average age of marriage for most of Northwestern Europe from 1500 to 1800 was around 25 years of age; as the Church dictated that both parties had to be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their parents, the bride and groom were roughly the same age, with most brides in their early twenties and most grooms two or three years older, and a substantial number of women married for the first time in their thirties and forties, particularly in urban areas, with the average age at first marriage rising and falling as circumstances dictated. In better times, more people could afford to marry earlier and thus fertility rose and conversely marriages were delayed or forgone when times were bad, thus restricting family size; after the Black Death, the greater availability of profitable jobs allowed more people to marry young and have more children, but the stabilization of the population in the 16th century meant fewer job opportunities and thus more people delaying marriages.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWhat is the average age that people have their first child in the UK?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the average age that people have their first child in the UK?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\nThe average age that people have their first child in the UK is 25.1 years old.", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

The name Glanville came from nearby Glanville Hall, residence of John Hart (1809–1873) thrice Premier of South Australia. Hart had named the house after his mother's maiden name (Mary Glanville).\n\n[2] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: Fort Glanville Conservation Park is one of South Australia's most important heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register, the former Register of the National Estate\n\n[3] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: Fort Glanville Historical Association operates the park under license and conducts open days in the park, recreating the past operation of the fort including military drill and the firing of period weapons. The Association, park service, other volunteers and various grants have all helped ensure the fort is presented in close to original condition. It is the most complete 19th Century fort in Australia, and one of very few in the world that remains in original condition. Connecting the fort to Semaphore jetty is the \"Semaphore and Fort Glanville Tourist Railway\", a gauge passenger steam train operated by volunteers from the National Railway Museum.\n\n[4] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: A significant change in the fort's conservation and preservation outlook was its declaration as a Historic Relic under the \"Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965\" on 25 May 1972. Up to then there had been growing awareness of the significance of the site in terms of the state's colonial heritage. Control of the park was moved to the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), and the fort and surrounds became designated as \"Fort Glanville Conservation Park\". The National Estate Grants Program provided funds in 1975 for conservation work; NPWS began this work in the same year and the caravan park boundary was moved southwards. Though the site had long been neglected, there was minimal permanent damage to its structure. During the 1970s reconstruction, much of the stockade was replaced. The replaced timbers are visibly different as they have shrunk significantly with large gaps that are not evident in the original timber. Adelaide City Council agreed to return the 64-pounder guns and new wheels were made; replacing those rotted over half a century before. In a ceremony on 2 October 1980, the 100th anniversary of the guns first firing, one of the 64-pounders was fired again; later a commemoration plaque was added to the fort's flagpole's base. Shortly after this firing the Fort Glanville Historical Association was formed, and was incorporated in 1981. Fort Glanville was opened for public visitation in 1981.\n\n[5] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: Work began in 1882 on Fort Glanville's northern sister Fort Largs—then known as the Port Adelaide battery—to the same specification as Fort Glanville; its barracks and rear defence wall were finished in 1885. Though guns had already been purchased specially, plans for the third fort at Glenelg were not proceeded with. South Australia was experiencing a depression in 1886 and that coupled with a report by General James Bevan Edwards scuttled plans for the third coastal fort. As early as 1888 the emphasis for defence of the Adelaide coast had already shifted to Fort Largs; a fact cited as part of the reason for abandonment of the Glenelg fortifications.\n\n[6] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: Connecting the fort to Semaphore jetty is the \"Semaphore and Fort Glanville Tourist Railway\", a gauge steam train operated by volunteers from the National Railway Museum. The railway opened in December 1992 and, as of 2002, carried over 16,000 passengers annually.\n\n[7] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: From this point Fort Glanville's significance declined rapidly. Fort Largs was equipped in 1889 with two 6 inch breech-loading disappearing guns which outranged Glanville's armament. The decline was also linked to changes in Port Adelaide's maritime facilities and the consequent northward movement of anchored and berthed vessels. During the 1880s the Port River was deepened enabling large ships to sail up and berth, rather than the former practice of anchoring off-shore.\n\n[8] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: The conservation park is in the suburb of Semaphore Park at the southern end of the Lefevre Peninsula. It covers approximately and is bounded by Bower and Military roads, the Point Malcolm Reserve and Semaphore beach. The land is entirely crown land and is administered by the DEWNR. It is divided into roughly two halves with the northern containing the fort and the southern half containing a caravan park. While it is managed by the DEWNR, the Fort Glanville Consultative Committee and Fort Glanville Historical Association are heavily involved. The committee is appointed by the Minister for Environment and Planning and acts to advise the Minister and liaise with the community. As of 1988, the fort hosted approximately 7,000 visitors annually, and is used as an event venue including the annual City of Charles Sturt citizenship ceremony.\n\n[9] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: Fort Glanville Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia located in Semaphore Park, a seaside suburb of Adelaide consisting of a functional 19th century fort listed on the South Australian Heritage Register and some adjoining land used as a caravan park. The fort was built after more than 40 years of indecision over the defence of South Australia. It was the first colonial fortification in the state and is the best preserved and most functional in Australia. Fort Glanville was designed by Governor Major General Sir William Jervois and Lieutenant Colonel Peter Scratchley, both important figures in early Australian colonial defence. When built it was designed to defend both Semaphore's anchorage and shipping entering the Port River from naval attack.\n\n[10] Fort Glanville Conservation Park: After the war, the State Government negotiated with its federal counterpart to gain control of Fort Glanville. This eventuated in the 1951 sale of the site, which was subsequently administered by the State Tourist Department as a caravan and camping park. The park occupied the muster ground outside the fort and the fort's barracks building was used as a manager's residence. The caravan park has had various managers since establishment: Until 1981 it was managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), by Woodville Council until 1986 and subsequently by a private operator under a long-term lease.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" to the following question:\n\nWhen was the Fort Glanville Conservation Park established?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The original barrier to the completion of the highway concerned the crossing of the Winnipeg River at two locations. The single span arch bridges are among the longest of their type in North America.\n\n[2] British Columbia: There are only five major routes to the rest of Canada. From south to north they are: BC Highway 3 through the Crowsnest Pass, the Vermilion Pass (Highway 93 in both British Columbia and Alberta), the Kicking Horse Pass, the latter being used by the Trans-Canada Highway entering Alberta through Banff National Park, the Yellowhead Highway (16) through Jasper National Park, and Highway 2 through Dawson Creek. There are also several highway crossings to the adjoining American states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. The longest highway is Highway 97, running from the British Columbia-Washington border at Osoyoos north to Watson Lake, Yukon and which includes the British Columbia portion of the Alaska Highway.\n\n[3] Nova Scotia Highway 102: The original portion of the highway from Bayers Road to Fall River was opened in October 1958, the bicentennial year of the First General Assembly of Nova Scotia (1758); as such, it is the oldest section of controlled access highway in Atlantic Canada. This portion of the highway was officially named Bicentennial Drive, but it has become known as the \"Bicentennial Highway\", often shortened to \"Bi-Hi\", even in official documents.\n\n[4] Great River Road: The Great River Road formerly continued north into Canada. There were two routes, one from Bemidji into Ontario and the other from Lake Itasca into Manitoba. The former followed US 71 to the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge, then Highway 71 to Longbow Corners on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 17) east of Kenora. Some sources indicate that it continued east on Highway 17 to Dryden or north on Highway 596 to Minaki. The other route followed MN 200 west from Lake Itasca to Zerkel, then ran north on MN 92 to Clearbrook, County 5 and BIA 3 to the shore of Lower Red Lake, MN 89 to Roseau, and east on MN 11 to Warroad. Crossing into Manitoba on MN 313, the Great River Road then followed Highway 12 north to near Ste. Anne, Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) to Winnipeg, and Highway 59 to near Victoria Beach, where it turned southeast on Highway 11 to near Seven Sisters Falls, Provincial Road 307 to near Rennie, Highway 44 to near West Hawk Lake, and finally east on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highways 1 and 17) to join the Ontario branch at Kenora.\n\n[5] Trans-Canada Highway: From the New Brunswick border, the main Trans-Canada Highway route continues east into Nova Scotia at Amherst, where it follows the designation of provincial Highway 104. Southeast of Amherst, near Thomson Station, the highway traverses the Cobequid Pass, a 45 kilometre (28 mi) tolled section ending at Masstown, before passing by Truro, where it links with Highway 102 to Halifax, east of the New Brunswick border. Halifax, like Toronto, is a provincial capital not serviced by a Trans-Canada Highway. Beyond Truro, the highway continues east for to New Glasgow where it meets Highway 106 before continuing to the Canso Causeway which crosses the Strait of Canso to Cape Breton Island near Port Hawkesbury. From the Canso Causeway, the highway continues east, now designated as Highway 105 on Cape Breton Island until reaching the Marine Atlantic ferry terminal at North Sydney.\n\n[6] Alberta Highway 2: Originally numbered as Highway 1, Highway 2 is the oldest major highway in Alberta and the first to stretch north into the Peace Country. It was historically known as the Calgary and Edmonton Trail, Sunshine Trail, and the Blue Trail. Major changes include the construction of a divided freeway between Calgary and Edmonton in the 1960s, realignment along Deerfoot Trail in the 1980s, and twinning south of Calgary in the 1990s. A Highway 43 realignment in 1998 shortened Highway 2 by nearly to its current northern terminus in Grande Prairie; it previously extended west to British Columbia Highway 2 at the border. Several projects including median widening and interchange upgrades have been undertaken in the 2010s to increase the safety of the highway's busier sections, with further improvements either under construction or awaiting funding. Bypasses of Fort Macleod, Claresholm, and Nanton are planned as part of Alberta's effort to make its portion of the CANAMEX Corridor free-flowing from border to border. Highway 2 is a core route in the National Highway System of Canada. The speed limit along most parts of the highway between Fort Macleod and Morinville is and in urban areas, such as through Claresholm, Nanton, Calgary and Edmonton, it ranges from to . During the winter, accidents are common on the stretch of the highway between Calgary and Edmonton as the weather can change rapidly and drivers underestimate\n\n[7] Geography of toll roads: Most tolled roadways in Canada are bridges to the United States, although a few domestic bridges in some provinces have tolls. In Vancouver, tolls were set up to pay for the construction of the new Port Mann Bridge which connects the Trans Canada Highway from Surrey to Coquitlam over the Fraser River. Toll highways disappeared, for the most part, in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, political pressure dropped the new tolls on an upgraded section of the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick. Highway 407 in the Greater Toronto Area is a modern \"toll route\" and does not have collection booths but an overhead sensor. It's heavily criticized as the government leased it for 99 years with the company having unlimited control of the highway and tolls so it is expensive, but still a necessity for gridlocked Toronto. Nova Scotia has a toll highway on the Trans Canada Highway between Debert and Oxford.\n\n[8] Gouin Boulevard: What is now Gouin Boulevard was first started in 1731, as part of the Chemin du Roy, the oldest highway in Canada. It first opened between 1734 and 1777, serving settlements that had started to be established at the end of the 17th century. In 1910, the portion of the Chemin du Roy on Montreal Island was renamed to \"Gouin\" in honour of politician Lomer Gouin (1861-1929), a premier of Quebec, by the District and County of Montreal.\n\n[9] Ontario Highway 12: The oldest portion of Highway 12 was originally known as the Coldwater Portage and later the Coldwater Road, connecting the modern sites of Orillia and Coldwater by a trail. Upper Canada Governor John Colborne surveyed the portage in 1830 and ordered it to be widened for wagon use. As the area was settled and an increasing need for land connection with the south arose, a new road was proposed from Whitby to Sturgeon Bay (near Waubaushene). In February 1843, the residents formally petitioned the government to construct the route. The Sturgeon Bay Road, from Coldwater to Sturgeon Bay, was opened as a rough wagon road in 1844. The Atherley Narrows, separating Lake Simcoe from Lake Couchiching, were surveyed in the early 1840s and the first causeway and bridge constructed in the years that followed. The portion of the route between Whitby and Orillia, however, was still under construction during the second half of the decade.\n\n[10] Trans-Canada Highway: From Ottawa, the Trans-Canada Highway proceeds east to Montreal, as Highway 417 in Ontario (and the Queensway in Ottawa) and in Quebec. The Trans-Canada assumes the name (also known as \"The Met\" or \"Metropolitan Boulevard\") as it traverses Montreal as an elevated highway. This is the busiest section of the highway. At the Laurentian interchange, in Montreal, the Abitibi route (Highway 66, Route 117, A-15) rejoins the main TCH line. The TCH then follows Autoroute 25 southbound, crossing the St. Lawrence River through the Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine Bridge–Tunnel, and proceeds northeast on Autoroute 20 for to (across from Quebec City).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWhat is the oldest highway in Canada?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Not to be confused with Jalalabad Airport in Afghanistan. Local travel agents use JBD as an unofficial three-letter airport code in Latin. The local code for Jalal-Abad Airport is ДЖБ.\n\n[2] Baghdad International Airport: In April 2003, US-led coalition forces invaded Iraq and changed the airport's name from Saddam International Airport to Baghdad International Airport. The ICAO code for the airport consequently changed from ORBS to ORBI; the IATA code subsequently switched from SDA to BGW, which previously referred to all Baghdad airports and before that to Al Muthana Airport when Saddam was in power.\n\n[3] Shahjalal International Airport: Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, ( \"Hôzrôt Shahjalal Antôrjatik Bimanbôndôr\") , is the largest and most prominent international airport in Bangladesh. It is located in Kurmitola 11 miles (17 kilometres) in the northern part of the capital city Dhaka and it is also a part of \"BAF Bangabandhu Base\" used by the Bangladesh Air Force. The airport has an area of . The Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) operates and maintains the airport. It started operations in 1980, taking over from Tejgaon Airport as the principal international airport of the country and was formerly known as Dacca International Airport and later as Zia International Airport, before being named in honour of Shah Jalal, who is one of the most respected Sufi saints of Bangladesh. The IATA code of the airport \"DAC\" is derived from \"Dacca\", which is the previously used spelling for \"Dhaka\".\n\n[4] Malaysia Airports: MAHB's present corporate structure includes several operating subsidiaries; Malaysia Airports Sdn. Bhd. (MASB), Malaysia Airports (Sepang) Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia Airports (Niaga) Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia Airports Technologies Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia Airports (Properties) Sdn. Bhd., K.L. Airport Hotel Sdn. Bhd., MAB Agriculture-Holticulture Sdn. Bhd, Malaysia Airports Consultancy Services Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia International Aerospace Centre (MIAC) Sdn Bhd., and Urusan Teknologi Wawasan Sdn. Bhd.. The Group has a total staff strength of over 10,000 deployed across 39 offices nationwide.\n\n[5] Baghdad Airport Road: The Baghdad Airport Road is a 12-kilometre (7.5 mi) stretch of highway in Baghdad, Iraq linking the Green Zone, a heavily fortified area at the centre of Baghdad, to Baghdad International Airport (BIAP). It also links different parts of Baghdad to the Airport and connects neighbouring areas to each other. It became prominent after the 2003 invasion of Iraq following its capture by the Coalition Forces. Although it was commonly referred to by the military Main Supply Route (MSR) designation \"Route Irish\", the route from the International Zone to the airport stretches over two MSRs: Route Aeros, the section leading into and out of the International Zone, and Route Irish, which stretches east from the airport, then turns south (past the junction with Route Aeros) to a junction with Highway 1 (MSR Tampa).\n\n[6] IATA airport code: Sometimes, a new airport is built, replacing the old one, leaving the city's new \"major\" airport code to no longer correspond with the city's name. The original airport in Nashville, Tennessee was built in 1936 as part of the Works Progress Administration and called Berry Field with the designation, BNA. A new facility known as Nashville International Airport was built in 1987 but still uses BNA. This is in conjunction to rules aimed to avoid confusion that seem to apply in the United States, which state that \"the first and second letters or second and third letters of an identifier may not be duplicated with less than 200 nautical miles separation.\" Thus, Washington D.C. area's three airports all have radically different codes: IAD for Washington–Dulles, DCA for Washington–Reagan (District of Columbia Airport), and BWI for Baltimore (Baltimore–Washington International, formerly BAL). Since HOU is used for William P. Hobby Airport, the new Houston–Intercontinental became IAH. The code BKK was originally assigned to Bangkok–Don Mueang and was later transferred to Suvarnabhumi Airport, while the former adopted DMK. Shanghai–Hongqiao retained the code SHA, while the newer Shanghai–Pudong adopted PVG. The opposite is true for Berlin, the airport Berlin–Tegel uses the code TXL, while its smaller counterpart Berlin–Schönefeld uses SXF; the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport is going to have the code BER. Hamburg (HAM) and Hannover (\n\n[7] Dhalbhumgarh Airport: Dhalbhumgarh Airport is a proposed public airport located at Dhalbhumgarh, in the state of Jharkhand, India as a greenfield airport for Jamshedpur. The Jharkhand State government and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the construction of the airport on 24 January 2019. Under the MoU, a joint venture company would be set up to construct the airport suitable for operation of ATR-72 type of aircraft.\n\n[8] Buddh International Circuit: Originally known as the Jaypee Group Circuit or the Jaypee International Circuit after the circuit's owners, the circuit was officially named the \"Buddh International Circuit\" in April 2011. According to Sameer Gaur, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Jaypee Sports International Limited, the name 'Buddh International Circuit' has been chosen with reference to the area where the racetrack is situated – Gautam Buddh Nagar district (also known as Greater Noida). Because of its location, naming the circuit 'Buddh International Circuit' was a logical choice for the company. The Buddh International circuit logo consists of a 'B' which also resembles a heart. The BIC logo is a stylized 'B', the letter that stands for 'Buddh' and for 'Bharata' (native name of India). The saffron, green and white colours used in the logo are representative of the Indian flag, while the curves in the stylized 'B' in the logo represent the lines of a racetrack.\n\n[9] Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport: The airport is named after the 17th-century Maratha warrior king, having been renamed in 1999 from the previous \"Sahar Airport\" to \"Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport\" (the title \"Maharaj\" was inserted on August 30, 2018). CSIA's IATA airport code – \"BOM\" – is derived from Bombay, Mumbai's former name. It is situated across the suburbs of Santacruz, Vile Parle and Sahar village in Andheri.\n\n[10] Berlin Brandenburg Airport: During much of the planning and construction phase the new airport was known as Berlin Brandenburg International Airport, abbreviated BBI. It was then discovered that the IATA code BBI already referred to Biju Patnaik International Airport, (also known as Bhubaneswar Airport) in India. When the planned opening date of 2 June 2012 drew nearer the FBB launched a marketing campaign introducing the BER branding, reflecting the new airport code.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the information provided:\n\nWhat is the IATA code for Jalal-Abad Airport?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The wart is used to convey the burden of our old customs and traditions. Krishnan Unni, who is well rooted in the old traditional ways, refuses to change with the times. He refuses to get it operated, but tries to cure it with old way of herbal medicine. The lesson here is if you don't change with time, the old customs and blind faith will become a burden and if you keep on doing that, there will be a time when they will take over you, meaning all your decisions will be based on how traditionally you were doing it or what the old scriptures or astrological charts dictate you. After a while these old traditions and customs, will be taken out as something personal to an individual or a group and would be associated with god,it would be made into something holy. Now everybody has to do it as it is divine. Murali in the end shows how the wart which was growing in him escapes from Krishnan Unni and becomes a huge elephant. There are a bunch of priests who are looking at the elephant and they comment, such a big animal, we should keep it in the temple.The wart which was personal to one person has become divine and holy to everyone now. All he had to do to cure the WART was seeks the help of science.\n\n[3] Ernst Weissert: In his article “Pädagogische Religion” (Educational Religion), he describes how the capacity for creative teaching can begin to grow: “The teacher must always ask himself how he can develop a sense of closeness to the child.” He has to “strive to develop a spiritual-educational sense of touch”. “This sense of touch, or child-sense gradually opens an attitude of soul that is full of devotion, love, commitment.” And this “devotion in the face of the Young, the Growing, turns into the art of dealing with human beings as a spiritual task of the twentieth century.\n\n[4] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[5] Humane law enforcement: If you acquire an interview to become a humane law enforcement officer, your interviewer will be looking for key personality traits and characteristics to set you aside from the other interviewees and show that you are mentally capable of performing the necessary duties. According to study.com, a person needs to exhibit these traits, \"Active listening, critical thinking, good judgment and decision-making, strong public speaking skills, ability to cope with high-stress situations involving animals and their owner\" in order to perform well. Criminologycareers.com emphasizes these characteristics along with compassion and understanding as \"absolute must-have abilities in order to stay safe on the job.\" The reasons why these traits are so important is because, just like with any typical police duty, you never know how the perpetrator will react. Plus people can be especially emotional when it comes to their animals because they may have a strong connection to the animal.\n\n[6] Emma Sophia Galton: In writing her financial guide, Galton noted that: \"Many young people, and especially widows and single ladies, when they first possess money of their own, are in want of advice when they have commonplace business matters to transact. [...] My aim throughout is to avoid all technicalities; to give plain and practical directions, not only as to what ought to be done, but how to do it.\" She went on to advise: \"When an inexperienced person comes into possession of her fortune, and especially if it be a small one, her first inquiry is, 'How can I invest my money so as to get the highest possible interest?' Let her rather seek to place it where her Capital will be safest. The Duke of Wellington used to say, 'High interest is another name for bad security.' In this country 41⁄2 per cent is generally the highest safe Interest you can receive: 4 per cent, more usually so. When 6, 7, 8, or more per cent, is offered by Banks, Mortgages, Loans, or Mines, beware of accepting it, as the probability is that you will lose both your Principal and Interest, as so many have done. Such an Interest can seldom be given consistently with safety.\"\n\n[7] Principle of least interest: The first major study to test the principle came in 1972 in a paper by Kenneth Eslinger, Alfred D Clarke and Russell R Dynes. In the paper the researchers interviewed 113 randomly selected college students that were enrolled in sociology courses to find out if a difference in emotional involvement existed in relationships and whether or not the level of involvement was affected by how the person was raised. The methods of raising kids that were covered by the study were bureaucratically or entrepreneurially. The study confirmed that was a difference involvement between how you were raised and how involved in a relationship you were. Furthermore, the study showed a large gap in involvement between males and females with the lowest female mean score four points higher than the highest male mean score. This showed that males as a group were significantly less interested in maintaining their relationship and could use the principle of least interest to their own means.\n\n[8] Tensta Konsthall: Recent exhibitions at Tensta konsthall include • “Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies,” with Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Goldin+Senneby, Wade Guyton, Mai-Thu Perret, Walid Raad, and Haegue Yang, among others • “Kami, Khokha, Bert and Ernie: World Heritage” by Hinrich Sachs • “Doing what you want: Marie-Louise Ekman accompanied by Sister Corita Kent, Mladen Stilinović, and Martha Wilson” • “The Society without qualities” with Sören Andreasen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Sture Johannesson, Sharon Lockhardt, and Palle Nielsen (part of “The new model” and curated by Lars Bang Larsen) • “Working With...” by Zak Kyes • “We are continuing BBDG” with Bernd Krauss • “Two Archives” by Babak Afrassiabi and Nasrin Tabatabai\n\n[9] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H.

King moved to Las Vegas in the early 1950s and was a fixture on the strip and local clubs until his death on February 3, 2006 from cancer. He was 83 years old.\n\n[2] 500 Club: After he and Jerry Lewis broke up their act, Dean Martin did not perform at the club again until August 1962. Martin was originally billed as a solo act, but was joined by both Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. at the midpoint of his engagement. The three performed as \"The Rat Pack\" until Martin's engagement at the club was over; this was the last time the Rat Pack performed in Atlantic City. Davis, Martin, and Sinatra performed their three night Rat Pack act at the club for no fee. The club was in financial difficulty at the time; they were all close friends of D'Amato and had been helped by him in earlier times. A private recording was made of the August 26, 1962 5AM show at the 500 Clubthe last performance of the Rat Pack there. It was later distributed as a souvenir to patrons of the now defunct Sinatrarama Room at Philadelphia's Latimer Cafe. The club continued to have financial problems in the 1970s. The Internal Revenue Service closed the club for back taxes in August 1971. D'Amato was allowed to reopen in November 1971 after an agreement was reached regarding payment of them.\n\n[3] Egan's Rats: With the 1924 convictions of Colbeck and his associates, Egan's Rats fell apart. The gang members who hadn't gone to prison scattered across the country, wreaking havoc wherever they went. One crew of ex-Rats, led by Fred \"Killer\" Burke, committed numerous robberies, kidnappings, and contract murders throughout the American Midwest. This crew allegedly took part in the infamous 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre of seven gangsters in Chicago. Burke was involved in the killings of Policemen in 1928 and 1929 and died in prison in 1940. Another ex-Rat, Leo Vincent Brothers, was convicted of killing \"Chicago Tribune\" reporter Jake Lingle in 1930. Two other former members, Pete and Thomas \"Yonnie\" Licavoli, started the “River Gang”, a large Detroit bootlegging gang that would dominate rackets in both Detroit and Toledo, Ohio. A former Rat named Elmer Macklin would murder Detroit mob boss Chester LaMare in February 1931. One member of the \"rats\" Raymond \"Craneneck\" Nugent was involved in the killing of an Ohio policeman in 1928 and later \"vanished\" in April 1931.\n\n[4] Sammy Davis Jr.: In 1959, Davis became a member of the Rat Pack, led by his friend Frank Sinatra, which included fellow performers Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, and Peter Lawford, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. Initially, Sinatra called the gathering \"the Clan\", but Davis voiced his opposition, saying that it reminded people of the Ku Klux Klan. Sinatra renamed the group \"the Summit\". One long night of poker that went on into the early morning saw the men drunken and disheveled. As Angie Dickinson approached the group, she said, \"You all look like a pack of rats.\" The nickname caught on, and they were called the Rat Pack, the name of its earlier incarnation led by Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who originally made the remark of the \"pack of rats\" about the group around her husband Bogart. The group around Sinatra made several movies together, including \"Ocean's 11\" (1960), \"Sergeants 3\" (1962), and \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\" (1964), and they performed onstage together in Las Vegas.\n\n[5] Christmas with the Rat Pack: Christmas with the Rat Pack is a 2002 album compiling Christmas songs by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n[6] Stifel Theatre: On June 20, 1965, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. with Johnny Carson as the emcee (subbing for Joey Bishop who was out with a bad back) performed their only televised concert together during the heyday of the Rat Pack at The Kiel Opera House. A closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts). After being thought lost for thirty years, Paul Brownstein tracked down a print of the show that had been sitting in a closet in St. Louis. It has since been broadcast on Nick at Nite (in 1998) as part The Museum of Television & Radio Showcase series and released on DVD as part of the \"Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin'\".\n\n[7] Rat Pack: According to Stephen Bogart, the original members of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack were: Frank Sinatra (pack master), Judy Garland (first vice-president), Nicole Bassing (den mother), Sid Luft (cage master), Bogart (rat in charge of public relations), Swifty Lazar (recording secretary and treasurer), Nathaniel Benchley (historian), David Niven, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, George Cukor, Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, and Jimmy Van Heusen. In his autobiography \"The Moon's a Balloon\", David Niven confirms that the Rat Pack originally included him but neither Sammy Davis, Jr. nor Dean Martin.\n\n[8] Rat Pack: The post-Bogart version of the group (Bogart died in 1957) was reportedly never called that name by any of its members – they called it \"the Summit\" or \"the Clan\". \"The Rat Pack\" was a term used by journalists and outsiders, although it remains the lasting name for the group.\n\n[9] Rat Pack: On June 20, 1965, Sinatra, Martin, and Davis, with Johnny Carson as the emcee (substituting for Bishop, who was out with a bad back), performed their only televised concert together during the heyday of the Pack at the Kiel Opera House in St. Louis, a closed-circuit broadcast done as a fundraiser for Dismas House (the first halfway house for ex-convicts) and fed live to movie theatres across the country. Thirty years later Paul Brownstein tracked down a print of the \"lost\" show in a St. Louis closet after someone noticed mysterious cameras onstage during a CBS documentary on Sinatra which filmed part of the show. It has since been broadcast on Nick at Nite (in 1998) as part of The Museum of Television & Radio Showcase series and released on DVD as part of the \"Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin\".\n\n[10] Rat Pack: Shirley MacLaine appeared in the 1958 film \"Some Came Running\" along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 Oscar-winning film \"Around the World in 80 Days\". MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate David Niven, and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich and George Raft. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film \"Can-Can\". She also had an appearance in the 1960 film \"Ocean's 11\" as a drunken woman. The 1984 film \"Cannonball Run II\", with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" to the following question:\n\nFamed as a member of the Rat Pack, who died on Christmas day 1995?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat science fiction film first featured robots?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Science fiction film: Robots have been a part of science fiction since the Czech playwright Karel Čapek coined the word in 1921. In early films, robots were usually played by a human actor in a boxy metal suit, as in \"The Phantom Empire\", although the female robot in \"Metropolis\" is an exception. The first depiction of a sophisticated robot in a United States film was Gort in \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\".\n\n[2] Science fiction film: Robots in films are often sentient and sometimes sentimental, and they have filled a range of roles in science fiction films. Robots have been supporting characters, such as Robby the Robot in \"Forbidden Planet\", Data in \"Star Trek\", sidekicks (e.g., C-3PO and R2-D2 from \"Star Wars\", JARVIS from \"Iron Man\"), and extras, visible in the background to create a futuristic setting (e.g., \"Back to the Future Part II\", \"Total Recall\" (2012), \"RoboCop\" (2014)). As well, robots have been formidable movie villains or monsters (e.g., the robot Box in the film \"Logan's Run\" (1976), HAL 9000 in \"\", ARIIA in \"Eagle Eye\", robot Sentinels in \"\", the battle droids in \"Star Wars\"). In some cases, robots have even been the leading characters in science fiction films; in the film \"Blade Runner\" (1982), many of the characters are bioengineered android \"replicants\", in the animated films \"WALL-E\" (2008), \"Astro Boy\" (2009), \"Big Hero 6\" (2014), and in \"Ghost in the Shell\" (2017).\n\n[3] Science fiction film: Building-size robots are also becoming a popular theme in movies as featured in \"Pacific Rim\". Future live action films may include an adaptation of popular television series like \"Voltron\" and \"Robotech\". The CGI robots of \"Pacific Rim\" and the \"Power Rangers\" (2017) reboot was greatly improved as compared to the original \"\" (1995). While \"size does matter\", a famous tagline of the movie \"Godzilla\", incredibly small robots, called nanobots, do matter as well (e.g. Borg nanoprobes in \"Star Trek\" and nanites in \"I, Robot\").\n\n[4] List of films considered the worst: \"Robot Monster\", a science-fiction film originally shot and exhibited in 3D, features an actor dressed in a gorilla suit and what looks almost like a diving helmet. The film, produced and directed by Phil Tucker, is listed in Michael Sauter's book \"The Worst Movies of All Time\" among \"The Baddest of the Bs\". It is also featured in \"The Book of Lists\" 10 worst movies list, and in \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". \"The Golden Turkey Awards\" confers on its main character the title of \"Most Ridiculous Monster in Screen History\" and, listing director Tucker among the runners-up to \"Worst Director of All Time\" (the winner being Ed Wood), states, \"What made \"Robot Monster\" ineffably worse than any other low-budget sci-fi epic was its bizarre artistic pretension\". It was featured in an episode of the movie-mocking television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and was fondly remembered by author Stephen King, who quotes, and agrees with, a review in \"Castle of Frankenstein\" magazine (\"certainly among the finest terrible movies ever made\", \"one of the most laughable poverty row quickies\").\n\n[5] Robby the Robot: Robby the Robot is a fictional character and science fiction icon who first appeared in the 1956 film \"Forbidden Planet\". He made a number of subsequent appearances in science fiction movies and television programs, usually without specific reference to the original film character.\n\n[6] Mari Wolf: Stories by Wolf include \"Robots of the World! Arise!\" (\"If: Worlds of Science Fiction\", 1952), \"An Empty Bottle\" (\"If: Worlds of Science Fiction\", 1952), \"The House on the Vacant Lot\" (\"Fantastic Story\", 1952), \"Prejudice\" (\"Destiny\", 1953), \"The Statue\" (\"If: Worlds of Science Fiction\", 1953), \"Homo Inferior\" (\"If: Worlds of Science Fiction\", 1953), \"The First Day of Spring\" (\"If: Worlds of Science Fiction\", 1954), and \"The Very Secret Agent\" (\"If: Worlds of Science Fiction\", 1954). The word \"droid\" for a robot first appears in a 1952 story by Wolf (\"Robots of the World! Arise!\"). Her mystery novel, \"The Golden Frame\", was published in 1961.\n\n[7] Gugusse and the Automaton: The film marked the first known cinematic appearance of a robot (a word that would not replace \"automaton\" until its use in Karel Čapek's play \"R.U.R.\"), and was one of the earliest films to feature themes of \"scientific experimentation, creation and transformation.\" In their \"Things to Come: An Illustrated History of the Science Fiction Film\", Douglas Menville and R. Reginald judged \"Gugusse\" to be the most significant scientifically themed film of 1897, and suggested that \"may be the first true SF film.\"\n\n[8] Forbidden Planet: \"Forbidden Planet\" pioneered several aspects of science fiction cinema. It was the first science fiction film to depict humans traveling in a faster-than-light starship of their own creation. It was also the first to be set entirely on another planet in interstellar space, far away from Earth. The Robby the Robot character is one of the first film robots that was more than just a mechanical \"tin can\" on legs; Robby displays a distinct personality and is an integral supporting character in the film. Outside science fiction, the film was groundbreaking as the first of any genre to use an entirely electronic musical score, courtesy of Bebe and Louis Barron.\n\n[9] Robot &amp; Frank: Robot & Frank is a 2012 American science fiction comedy-drama film directed by Jake Schreier and written by Christopher Ford. Set in the near future, it focuses on Frank Weld, an aging jewel thief played by Frank Langella, whose son buys him a domestic robot. Resistant at first, Frank warms up to the robot when he realizes he can use it to restart his career as a cat burglar. It was the first feature film for both Ford and Schreier and received critical acclaim for its writing, production, and acting. It won the Alfred P. Sloan Prize at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, tying with the Kashmiri film \"Valley of Saints\". The robot was created by Tony Gardner's special effects company Alterian, Inc.\n\n[10] 1919 in science fiction: The year 1919 was marked, in science fiction, by the following events. The main science-fiction Awards known at the present time did not exist at this time.The Harry Houdini serial The Master Mystery featured the first robot in film, called the Automaton.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Unveiled during this evening for the first time was the Guild’s new award statuette, The Actor, as well as the first awards for ensembles in drama series and comedy series which honor all of the actors who are the regulars in television series. From this auspicious beginning the Screen Actors Guild Awards® has been embraced as one of the most prestigious in the entertainment industry.\n\n[2] Screen Actors Guild: A meeting in March 1933 of six actors (Berton Churchill, Charles Miller, Grant Mitchell, Ralph Morgan, Alden Gay, and Kenneth Thomson) led to the guild's foundation. Three months later, three of the six and eighteen others became the guild's first officers and board of directors: Ralph Morgan (its first president), Alden Gay, Kenneth Thomson, Alan Mowbray (who personally funded the organization when it was first founded), Leon Ames, Tyler Brooke, Clay Clement, James Gleason, Lucile Webster Gleason, Boris Karloff, Claude King, Noel Madison, Reginald Mason, Bradley Page, Willard Robertson, Ivan Simpson, C. Aubrey Smith, Charles Starrett, Richard Tucker, Arthur Vinton, Morgan Wallace and Lyle Talbot.\n\n[3] Screen Actors Guild: In 1925, the Masquers Club was formed by actors discontent with the grueling work hours at the Hollywood studios. This was one of the major concerns which led to the creation of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933. Another was that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which at that time arbitrated between the producers and actors on contract disputes, had a membership policy which was by invitation only.\n\n[4] Screen Actors Guild: The Screen Actors Guild Women's Committee was founded in 1972.\n\n[5] Actors' Equity Association: The Actors Equity Association allowed small numbers of contracts to be negotiated over the next few years. In 1933 the Screen Actors Guild was created and took the place of AEA as the main representative for movie actors and producers. This allowed the Actors Equity Association to focus its efforts on live productions such as theatrical performances, while the Screen Actors Guild focused on movie production and non-scripted live performances such as minstrel, vaudeville, and live radio shows.\n\n[6] Screen Actors Guild: In July 1948, a strike was averted at the last minute as the SAG and major producers agreed upon a new collective bargaining contract. The major points agreed upon included: full union shop for actors to continue, negotiations for films sent direct to TV, producers could not sue an actor for breach of contract if they strike (but the guild could only strike when the contract expires).\n\n[7] Screen Actors Guild: The Screen Actors Guild Ethnic Minorities Committee was co-founded in 1972 by actors Henry Darrow, Edith Diaz, Ricardo Montalban and Carmen Zapata.\n\n[8] Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award: The Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award is an award presented by the Screen Actors Guild's National Honors and Tributes Committee for \"outstanding achievement in fostering the finest ideals of the acting profession.\" The award predates the 1st Screen Actors Guild Awards by over thirty years. The first recipient of the award was performer and comedian Eddie Cantor, awarded to him in 1962. Since 1962, the award has been presented every year except for 1963 and 1981. There has been two occasions where two individuals received the award the same year: the first in 1985, when it was presented to actor Paul Newman and actress Joanne Woodward, and again in 2000, when it was presented to civil rights activists Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee. As of 2018, 54 individuals have received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award: 46 men and 19 women.\n\n[9] Screen Directors Guild of New Zealand: The Directors and Editors Guild of New Zealand (DEGNZ) is a screen-sector guild that represents the interests of directors and editors within New Zealand's Screen and Motion Picture Industry. Initially known as the Screen Directors Guild of New Zealand (SDGNZ), it was founded in 1995 when 18 New Zealand (NZ) directors gathered together at an annual industry conference in Wellington to discuss directors' conditions of work and the need for an organization to represent their interests independent of the Screen Production and Development Association (SPADA), which had evolved from the original concept of a guild that represented both producers & directors.\n\n[10] SAG Foundation: The Screen Actors Guild Foundation is an American organisation that provides assistance and educational programming to the professionals of Screen Actors Guild. It also provides children’s literacy programs to the public. Founded in 1985, it relies solely on support from grants, corporate sponsorships and individuals to maintain its programs.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question: When was the Screen Actors Guild founded?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question \"When was the Screen Actors Guild founded?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nConfidence: 100%", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "Yes, answer is present.

Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery of a large number of comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun. All these satellites have observed the Sun from the plane of the ecliptic, and so have only observed its equatorial regions in detail. The Ulysses probe was launched in 1990 to study the Sun's polar regions. It first travelled to Jupiter, to \"slingshot\" into an orbit that would take it far above the plane of the ecliptic. Once Ulysses was in its scheduled orbit, it began observing the solar wind and magnetic field strength at high solar latitudes, finding that the solar wind from high latitudes was moving at about 750 km/s, which was slower than expected, and that there were large magnetic waves emerging from high latitudes that scattered galactic cosmic rays.\n\n[2] SOLAR (ISS): SOLAR is an ESA science observatory on the Columbus Laboratory, which is part of the International Space Station. SOLAR was launched with Columbus on February 2008 aboard STS-122. It was externally mounted to Columbus with the European Technology Exposure Facility (EuTEF). SOLAR has three main space science instruments: SOVIM, SOLSPEC and SOL-ACES. Together they provide detailed measurements of the Sun's spectral irradiance. The SOLAR platform and its instruments are controlled from the Belgian User Support and Operations Centre (B.USOC), located at the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BISA) in Uccle, Belgium.The mission was originally planned for a 2003 launch, but was delayed following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Some other components are also planned to be mounted externally on Columbus on future missions, including the Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES). Another name for SOLAR may be Solar Monitoring Observatory or SMO.\n\n[3] Coronal loop: Many strides have been made by ground-based telescopes (such as the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, MLSO, in Hawaii) and eclipse observations of the corona, but to escape the obscuring effect of the Earth's atmosphere, space-based observations have become a necessary evolution for solar physics. Beginning with the short (seven-minute) Aerobee rocket flights in 1946 and 1952, spectrograms measured solar EUV and Lyman-α emissions. Basic X-ray observations were attained by 1960 using such rockets. The British Skylark rocket missions from 1959 to 1978 also returned mainly X-ray spectrometer data. Although successful, the rocket missions were very limited in lifetime and payload. During the period of 1962–1975, the satellite series Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO-1 to OSO-8) were able to gain extended EUV and X-ray spectrometer observations. Then, in 1973, Skylab was launched and began a new multi-wavelength campaign that typified future observatories. This mission lasted only a year and was superseded by the Solar Maximum Mission, which became the first observatory to last the majority of a solar cycle (from 1980 to 1989). A wealth of data was accumulated across the whole range of emission.\n\n[4] Argentina: Space research has also become increasingly active in Argentina. Argentine built satellites include LUSAT-1 (1990), Víctor-1 (1996), PEHUENSAT-1 (2007), and those developed by CONAE, the Argentine space agency, of the SAC series. Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company INVAP, which provides several countries with nuclear reactors. Established in 1991, the CONAE has since launched two satellites successfully and, in June 2009, secured an agreement with the European Space Agency for the installation of a 35-m diameter antenna and other mission support facilities at the Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's foremost cosmic ray observatory. The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock\n\n[5] Vostochny Cosmodrome: The new cosmodrome is to enable Russia to launch most missions from its own land, and to reduce Russia's dependency on the Baikonur Cosmodrome which is leased from the government of Kazakhstan. Currently, Baikonur is the only launch site operated by Russia with the capability to launch crewed missions to ISS or elsewhere. The Russian government pays a yearly rent of $115 million to Kazakhstan for its usage. Satellites bound for geostationary orbit and high inclination orbits can be currently launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwestern Russia. The new site is intended mostly for civilian launches. Roscosmos plans to move 45% of Russia's space launches to Vostochny by 2020, while Baikonur's share will drop from 65% to 11%, and Plesetsk will account for 44 percent. In 2012, the share of space launches from Russia's territory stood at 25%. By 2030 this figure is projected to increase to 90%. A more recent related opinion piece from Ars Technica pointed out that while Russia had roughly half of the commercial launch market in 2015, SpaceX launched more commercial payloads in 2017 than Russia. The author further speculated that the track record of SpaceX in cutting launch costs and continually improving rocket designs may make future Russian rockets uneconomical in spite of efforts at new designs.\n\n[6] Comparison of Asian national space programs: China has a space program with an independent human spaceflight capability. It has developed a sizable family of successful Long March rockets. It has launched two lunar orbiters, Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2. On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with Chang'e 3 Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so. It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned space station, starting with the launch of Tiangong 1 and followed by Tiangong 2 in 2016. China attempted to send a Mars orbiter (Yinghuo-1) in 2011 on a joint mission with Russia, which failed to leave Earth orbit. Nevertheless, the 2020 Chinese Mars Mission with an orbiter, a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020. China has collaborative projects with Russia, ESA, and Brazil, and has launched commercial satellites for other countries. Some analysts suggest that the Chinese space program is linked to the nation's efforts at developing advanced military technology.\n\n[7] Chinese space program: According to the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) presentation at the 2015 International Space Development Congress in Toronto, Canada, Chinese interest in space-based solar power began in the period 1990–1995. By 2011 there was a proposal for a national program, with advocates such as Pioneer Professor Wang Xiji stating in an article for the Ministry of Science and technology that \"China had built up a solid industrial foundation, acquired sufficient technology and had enough money to carry out the most ambitious space project in history. Once completed, the solar station, with a capacity of 100MW, would span at least one square kilometre, dwarfing the International Space Station and becoming the biggest man-made object in space\" and \"warned that if it did not act quickly, China would let other countries, in particular the US and Japan, take the lead and occupy strategically important locations in space.\" Global Security cites a 2011-01 Journal of Rocket propulsion that articulates the need for 620+ launches of their Long March-9 (CZ-9) heavy lift system for the construction of an orbital solar power plant with 10,000 MW capacity massing 50,000 tonnes.\n\n[8] Solar and Heliospheric Observatory: The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is a spacecraft built by a European industrial consortium led by Matra Marconi Space (now Astrium) that was launched on a Lockheed Martin Atlas II AS launch vehicle on December 2, 1995 to study the Sun. SOHO has also discovered over 3,000 comets. It began normal operations in May 1996. It is a joint project of international cooperation between the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA. Originally planned as a two-year mission, \"SOHO\" continues to operate after over 20 years in space: the mission is extended until the end of 2020 with a likely extension until 2022.\n\n[9] List of NASA missions: NASA brought the Orion MPCV back to life from the defunct Constellation Program and successfully test launched the first capsule on December 5, 2014 aboard EFT-1. After a near perfect flight traveling 3600 miles above Earth, the spacecraft was recovered for study. NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to send humans to deep space locations such as the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, and Mars starting in the 2020s. Orion will be powered by NASA's new heavy lift vehicle, the Space Launch System (SLS), which is currently under development. Orion's next flight, along with the first SLS flight, is slated to launch in December 2019, with the designation of Exploration Mission 1. This mission will send an uncrewed Orion capsule around the Moon. It will be succeeded by Exploration Mission 2, sending a crewed Orion spacecraft to an undetermined location in the early 2020s.- Earth Observing System - Great Observatories - High Energy Astronomy Observatory program - Living With a Star - New Millennium Program (NMP) - Origins program - Small Explorer program (SMEX) - Solar Terrestrial Probes program\n\n[10] Marshall Space Flight Center: Shortly after NASA was formed, the Orbiting Solar Observatory was launched, and was followed by the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) that carried out ultraviolet observations of stars between 1968 and 1972. These showed the value of space-based astronomy, and led to the planning of the Large Space Telescope (LST) that would be launched and maintained from the forthcoming space shuttle. Budget limitations almost killed the LST, but the astronomy community – especially Lyman Spitzer – and the National Science Foundation pressed for a major program in this area. Congress finally funded LST in 1978, with an intended launch date of 1983.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following questions:\n\n1.

In early 1939 Germany demanded that Poland join the Anti-Comintern Pact as a satellite state of Germany. Poland, fearing a loss of independence, refused, and Hitler told his generals on 23 May 1939 that the reason for invading Poland was not Danzig: \"\"Danzig is not the issue at stake. It's a matter of extending our living space in the East...\"\" To deter Hitler, Britain and France announced that an invasion would mean war and tried to convince the Soviet Union to join in this deterrence. The USSR however gained control of the Baltic states and parts of Poland by allying with Germany, which it did through the secret Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. London's attempt at deterrence failed, but Hitler did not expect a wider war. Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and rejected the British and French demands that it withdraw, resulting in their declaration of war on September 3, 1939, in accordance with the defense treaties with Poland that they had signed and publicly announced.\n\n[2] Fascism and ideology: The invasion of Poland by Germany was deemed unacceptable by Britain, France and their allies, resulting in their mutual declaration of war against Germany that was deemed the aggressor in the war in Poland, resulting in the outbreak of World War II. Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned Poland between them in late 1939 followed by the successful German offensive in Scandinavia and continental Western Europe in 1940. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini led Italy into World War II on the side of the Axis. Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with France or the United Kingdom and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse. Mussolini believed that following a brief entry of Italy into war with France, followed by the imminent French surrender, Italy could gain some territorial concessions from France and then concentrate its forces on a major offensive in Egypt where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. Plans by Germany to invade the United Kingdom in 1940 failed after Germany lost the aerial warfare campaign in the Battle of Britain. The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa.\n\n[3] History of Poland (1939–1945): The Munich Agreement of 1938 did not last for long. In March 1939 the German occupation of Czechoslovakia began with the invasion of Bohemia and Moravia, leaving Slovakia as a German puppet state. Lithuania was forced to give up its Klaipėda Region (\"Memelland\"). Formal demands were made for the return of the Free City of Danzig to Germany, even though its status was guaranteed by the League of Nations. In early 1939 Hitler proposed Poland an alliance on German terms, with an expectation of compliance. The Polish government would have to agree to Danzig's incorporation by the Reich and to an extraterritorial highway passage connecting East Prussia with the rest of Germany through the so-called Polish Corridor (an area linking the Polish mainland with the Baltic Sea). Poland would join an anti-Soviet alliance and coordinate its foreign policy with Germany, thus becoming a client state. The independence-minded Polish government was alarmed and a British guarantee of Poland's independence was issued on 31 March 1939. Reacting to this act and to Poland's effective rejection of the German demands, Hitler renounced the existing German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact on April 28.\n\n[4] History of Poland: On 1 September 1939, Hitler ordered an invasion of Poland, the opening event of World War II. Poland had signed an Anglo-Polish military alliance as recently as 25 August, and had long been in alliance with France. The two Western powers soon declared war on Germany, but they remained largely inactive (the period early in the conflict became known as the Phoney War) and extended no aid to the attacked country. The technically and numerically superior \"Wehrmacht\" formations rapidly advanced eastwards and engaged massively in the murder of Polish civilians over the entire occupied territory. On 17 September, a Soviet invasion of Poland began. The Soviet Union quickly occupied most of the areas of eastern Poland that contained large populations of Ukrainians and Belarusians. The two invading powers divided up the country as they had agreed in the secret provisions of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Poland's top government officials and military high command fled the war zone and arrived at the Romanian Bridgehead in mid-September. After the Soviet entry they sought refuge in Romania.\n\n[5] Invasion of Poland: On 30 January 1933, the National Socialist German Workers' Party, under its leader Adolf Hitler, came to power in Germany. While the Weimar Republic had long sought to annex territories belonging to Poland, it was Hitler's own idea and not a realization of Weimar plans to invade and partition Poland, annex Bohemia and Austria, and create satellite or puppet states economically subordinate to Germany. As part of this long-term policy, Hitler at first pursued a policy of rapprochement with Poland, trying to improve opinion in Germany, culminating in the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934. Earlier, Hitler's foreign policy worked to weaken ties between Poland and France, and attempted to manoeuvre Poland into the Anti-Comintern Pact, forming a cooperative front against the Soviet Union. Poland would be granted territory to its northeast in Ukraine and Belarus if it agreed to wage war against the Soviet Union, but the concessions the Poles were expected to make meant that their homeland would become largely dependent on Germany, functioning as little more than a client state. The Poles feared that their independence would eventually be threatened altogether; historically Hitler had already denounced the right of Poland to independence in 1930, writing that Poles and Czechs are a “rabble not worth a penny more than the inhabitants of Sudan or India. How can they demand the rights of independent states?”\n\n[6] Refugee: After the Soviet armed forces captured eastern Poland from the Germans in 1944, the Soviets unilaterally declared a new frontier between the Soviet Union and Poland approximately at the Curzon Line, despite the protestations from the Polish government-in-exile in London and the western Allies at the Teheran Conference and the Yalta Conference of February 1945. After the German surrender on 7 May 1945, the Allies occupied the remainder of Germany, and the Berlin declaration of 5 June 1945 confirmed the division of Allied-occupied Germany according to the Yalta Conference, which stipulated the continued existence of the German Reich as a whole, which would include its eastern territories as of 31 December 1937. This did not impact on Poland's eastern border, and Stalin refused to be removed from these eastern Polish territories.\n\n[7] Occupation of Poland (1939–1945): The occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War (1939–1945) began with the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, and it was formally concluded with the defeat of Germany by the Allies in May 1945. Throughout the entire course of the foreign occupation, the territory of Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR) with the intention of eradicating Polish culture and subjugating its people by occupying German and Soviet powers. In summer-autumn of 1941 the lands annexed by the Soviets were overrun by Germany in the course of the initially successful German attack on the USSR. After a few years of fighting, the Red Army drove the German forces out of the USSR and across Poland from the rest of Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n[8] Germany–Poland relations: In 1918, Poland regained its place on the map. After World War I, the Treaty of Versailles deprived Germany of its territories in West Prussia, East Upper Silesia and Danzig (Gdansk) and transferred them all to Poland. It was seen as a great injustice in the Weimar Republic, in part leading to the Nazi takeover of power in 1933. On 1 September 1939, Poland was invaded by Germany, thus initiating World War II. The Third Reich established concentration camps in German-occupied Poland, the biggest located in Auschwitz. Poland suffered many casualties and huge damages during the war. After World War II, Germany lost its former eastern territories to Poland and the Soviet Union. In 1945-1950, a series of expulsions and fleeings happened, in which up to 16 million ethnic Germans were forced to leave their homes in Poland and resettle in post-war Germany. It was the largest forced movement of any population in history.\n\n[9] War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II: Following 1 September 1939 invasion of Poland from the west by Germany, their Soviet ally attacked from the east on 17 September in accordance with the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a secret non-aggression agreement signed in August. Within a month, Poland had been divided between two occupational forces. Germany annexed 91,902 square kilometres with 10 million citizens and controlled the newly created General Government, which consisted of a further 95,742 kilometres with 12 million citizens. In total, Germany's zone of occupation consisted of 187,644 square kilometres with 22 million citizens. The Soviet Union occupied 202,069 square kilometres with over 13 million citizens. There were many similarities between the two zones of occupations marked by systematic oppression.\n\n[10] Collaboration in German-occupied Poland: Nazi authorities annexed the westernmost parts of Poland and the former Free City of Danzig, incorporating it directly to Nazi Germany, and placed the remaining German-occupied territory under the administration of the newly formed \"General Government\". The Soviet Union annexed the rest of Poland, incorporating its territories into the Belarusian and Ukrainian Soviet republics. Germany's primary aim in Eastern Europe was the expansion of the German \"Lebensraum\" which necessitated according to Nazi views the elimination or deportation of all non-Germanic ethnicities, including Poles; the areas controlled by the \"General Government\" were to become \"free\" of Poles within 15–20 years. This resulted in harsh policies which targeted the Polish population, in addition to the explicit goal of exterminating Polish Jews, which was carried out by Nazi Germany in the occupied Polish territories.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nHow long did Germany occupy Poland?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHow many people live in China?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Migration in China: Internal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization. In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\" Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system. In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status. Migrant workers are not necessarily rural workers; they can simply be people living in urban areas with rural household registration.\n\n[2] Miao people: Though the Miao themselves use various self-designations, the Chinese traditionally classify them according to the most characteristic color of the women's clothes. The list below contains some of these self-designations, the color designations, and the main regions inhabited by the four major groups of Miao in China:According to the 2000 census, the number of Miao in China was estimated to be about 9.6 million. Outside of China, members of the Miao linguistic/cultural family sub-group or nations of the Hmong live in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Burma due to outward migrations starting in the 18th century. As a result of recent migrations in the aftermath of the Indochina and Vietnam Wars from 1949–75, many Hmong people now live in the United States, French Guiana, France and Australia. Altogether, there are approximately 8 million speakers in the Miao language family. This language family, which consists of 6 languages and around 35 dialects (some of which are mutually intelligible) belongs to the Hmong/Miao branch of the Hmong–Mien (Miao–Yao) language family.\n\n[3] HIV/AIDS in China: Much of the current spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in China has been through intravenous drug use and prostitution. In China, the number of people affected by HIV has been estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million; somewhere below or around 0.1% of the population.National Intelligence Council. The next wave of HIV/AIDS: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russia, India, China. ICA 2002-04 D. September, 2002. The CIA World Factbook as of 2012 estimated the percentage of adults (aged 15–49) living with HIV/AIDS in China at 0.1%, the same as in Japan and less than in many European Union countries such as the United Kingdom (0.2%) and Austria (0.3%). According to a United Nations report in 2001, the main distributors of HIV were the sharing of needles among drug users and problems during blood donations. In many rural areas of China during the 1990s, for example, faulty blood collection programs infected a large number of people with HIV.\n\n[4] Dugout (shelter): In north China, especially on the Loess Plateau, caves called yaodongs dug into hillsides have been the traditional dwellings from early times. The advantage of a yaodong over an ordinary house is that it needs little heating in winter and no cooling in summer. An estimated 40 million people in northern China live in a yaodong. Many people live in semi-recessed dugout houses in north-western China where hot summer and cold winters prevail.\n\n[5] Bahá'í Faith in China: As a result of the lack of formal registration and structure, it is difficult to ascertain with some degree of certainty, the number of Bahá'ís in China. The number of active followers of Bahá'u'lláh's Teachings in China has spread beyond the scope of knowledge of the existing administrative structures. Certainly there are active followers of the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh in all of the major cities of China and in many regional centers and rural areas. China also has a substantial community of interest that see in the Bahá'í Writings guidance on how to live better lives, build a stronger family, be better parents, help their neighborhoods, communities and country by practicing all or part of the Bahá'í Teachings. In recent years the foreign Bahá'ís living in China, in consultation with the relevant local authorities, have formed Foreign Bahá'í Associations. Currently there are Foreign Bahá'í Associations in five cities (Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Shenzhen). They gather, with the knowledge of local authorities, in certain designated public places for spiritual gatherings, the observance of Bahá'í Holy Days and activities related to the spiritual education of their children and junior youth. These groups also aim to demonstrate the sincerity and the desire of foreign Bahá'ís to contribute to the advancement of China and its peoples.\n\n[6] Mongols in China: Chinese Mongols are citizens of the China who are ethnic Mongols (). They form one of the 55 ethnic minorities officially recognized by the People's Republic of China. There are approximately 5.8 million people classified as ethnic Mongols living in China. Most of them live in Inner Mongolia, Northeast China, Xinjiang, etc. The Mongol population in China is over twice that of the sovereign state of Mongolia.\n\n[7] Seventh-day Adventist Church in the People's Republic of China: The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a major Christian denomination with a significant presence in the People's Republic of China with over 446,227 members as of June 30, 2017. Many of its pastors in China are women. There are or used to be more than 350 SDA congregations in Jilin Province. Pastor Jan Paulsen, the Adventist world church president, visited China in 2009. There he said \"so many things have changed in China over the last two decades, and while freedom -- the increase of freedom -- is difficult to compare, I am very, very grateful for the fact that so many changes have taken place in this country.\"\n\n[8] Special education in China: According to the 2006 census, 82.96 million disabled people live in China, an estimated 6.34% of the overall population. This statistic had a 1.44% increase from the year 1987. Men outnumber women in China’s 1.35 billion population making it no surprise that more than half of the people with disabilities are male. The number of disabled people living in the rural areas of China is 75% of the disabled population, compared to the urban which held 25% of the disabled population. Specifically relating to school-aged population, disabled children at the age between 6-14 reached to 2.46 million, 2.96% of the total disabled population. Less than 3% of China’s disabled population is in the school-aged demographic. Although this statistic is shockingly low, the one child policy contributes to much of the population decreases seen in recent history especially among school-aged children. China categorizes disabilities differently than in other nations, for example China identified 5% of their school-aged population to be in need of special education whereas The United States identified 10% of their school-aged population; this comparison is a result of China not recognizing learning disabilities or disorders such as ADHD to be in need of special services whereas many other nations do. Educational opportunities for disabled Chinese are lacking, causing elevated poverty and poor living conditions .\n\n[9] Standard of living in China: Since the 1990s there has been an increasing number of apartment built in China which remain empty. By 2010 approximately 65 million apartments, capable of housing some 250 million people, were unoccupied, due to there being too expensive for the majority of Chinese to purchase or rent. At the same time many millions of urban Chinese remained living in slums. But, as the urbanization rate in China remains high (approx. 20 million Chinese move from rural areas each year) this problem is not severe and many so-called \"ghost cities\" become inhabited. As for 2012, there is 35 sq.meters per person in average and construction rate exceeds 1.5 sq. meters per year which allows total living area to exceed 50 sq. meters per capital as soon as in the year 2020.\n\n[10] Indians in China: The number in the Mainland is growing rapidly with the Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China recording 15,051 Indian nationals living in mainland China as of 2010. Other sources report more with a columnist for the \"Economic Times\" stating that the number of Indians in China was 45-48,000 in 2015. Many Indians in China are students, traders and professionals employed with MNCs, Indian companies and banks.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nHow many people live in China?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if any of the contexts contain information about the question.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nThe answer to the question of how many people live in China is present in context [1].

The series consists of \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), \"\" (2004), and \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" (2016). The film series has grossed over $756 million worldwide against a combined budget of $100 million.\n\n[2] Bridget Jones's Baby: In July 2009, \"Variety\" announced that a third instalment of the \"Bridget Jones\" films was in the early stages of development. Working Title Films confirmed that it would not be based on Helen Fielding's third \"Bridget Jones\" novel, but instead would be based on the columns she wrote for \"The Independent\" in 2005. On 1 March 2011, it was reported that both Renée Zellweger and Colin Firth were interested in reprising their roles. In July 2011, Paul Feig was in final talks to direct the film based on the script by author Fielding. On 11 August 2011, Universal Studios and Working Title greenlit the third film. On 4 October 2011, \"Deadline\" reported that Feig had exited the project due to creative differences with Working Title, and Feig had also worked on the recent draft of the script. Production was slated to begin in January 2012 with the returning cast including Zellweger, Firth, and Hugh Grant. On 30 November 2011, Peter Cattaneo came on board to direct the sequel, newly titled \"\"Bridget Jones's Baby\"\" from a script by Fielding, Feig, and David Nicholls. Producers on board were Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title, along with Jonathan Cavendish of Little Bird. The production was delayed due to creative differences between the script of the film and actors, especially Grant as he disliked the script and reportedly Grant had left the project, though this was denied by producer\n\n[3] Bridget Jones's Baby: \"Bridget Jones's Baby\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78%, based on 200 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Bridget Jones's Baby\" might be late on arrival, but fans of the series should still find its third installment a bouncing bundle of joy.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a score 59 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n[4] Bridget Jones: The first novel was turned into a movie of the same name in 2001, directed by Sharon Maguire. The movie starred Renée Zellweger as Bridget, Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy. Before the film was released, a considerable amount of controversy surrounded the casting of the American Zellweger as what some saw as a quintessentially British heroine: however, her performance is widely considered to be of a high standard, including a perfect English accent, and garnered Zellweger an Academy Award nomination. A was released in 2004, directed by Beeban Kidron. There are many differences between the books and the films. A third movie, \"Bridget Jones's Baby\", was released on 16 September 2016. Patrick Dempsey was cast as Jack Qwant.\n\n[5] Bridget Jones's Diary (film): Bridget Jones (Renée Zellweger) is 32 years old, single, very accident-prone, and worried about her weight. She works in publicity at a book publishing company in London where her main focus is fantasising about her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). At a New Year party hosted by her parents, she re-encounters Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), the barrister son of her parents' friends. They had known each other as children. After their initial encounter, Mark thinks that Bridget is a fool and vulgar and Bridget thinks that he is arrogant and rude, and is disgusted by his novelty Christmas jumper. After overhearing Mark grumble to his mother about her attempts to set him up with \"a verbally incontinent spinster who smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother\", she decides to turn her life around. She starts her own diary, which covers all her attempts to stop smoking, lose weight and find her Mr. Right.\n\n[6] Joanna Scanlan: Scanlan returned to the big screen as Cathy in \"Bridget Jones's Baby\". Based on Helen Fielding's 2006 columns, the film fills in the gap between the last film and her subsequent book \"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy\". Directed by Sharon Maguire (\"Bridget Jones's Diary\"), the film finds Bridget unexpectedly expecting.\n\n[7] Bridget Jones (film series): Bridget Jones is struggling with her current state of life, including her break up with her love Mark Darcy. As she pushes forward and works hard to find fulfilment in her life seems to do wonders until she meets a dashing and handsome American named Jack Quant. Things from then on go great, until she discovers that she is pregnant but the biggest twist of all, she does not know if Mark or Jack is the father of her child.\n\n[8] Bridget Jones's Baby: Bridget now works as a top television producer and is close friends with the anchor of the news show she runs, Miranda (Sarah Solemani), who offers to take her out for her birthday. Bridget turns down her offer as she'd already made plans to celebrate with her old gang of three best friends, but is disappointed when they all cancel on her at the last minute due to family commitments. In the end, she spends the night of her birthday alone at home.\n\n[9] Bridget Jones: Helen Fielding (as Bridget Jones) wrote of her love of the 1995 BBC adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in her \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" column during the original British broadcast, mentioning her \"simple human need for Darcy to get off with Elizabeth\" and regarding the couple as her \"chosen representatives in the field of shagging, or rather courtship\". Fielding loosely reworked the plot of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in her 1996 novelization of the column, naming Bridget's uptight love interest \"Mark Darcy\" and describing him exactly like Colin Firth. Following a first meeting with Firth during his filming of \"Fever Pitch\" in 1996, Fielding asked him to collaborate in what would become an eight-page interview between Bridget Jones and Firth in her 1999 sequel novel, \"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\". Conducting the real interview with Firth in Rome, Fielding lapsed into Bridget Jones mode and obsessed over Darcy in his wet shirt. Firth participated in the following editing process of what critics would consider \"one of the funniest sequences in the diary's sequel\". Both novels make various other references to the BBC serial.\n\n[10] Bridget Jones's Baby: Bridget Jones's Baby is a 2016 romantic comedy film directed by Sharon Maguire and written by Helen Fielding, Dan Mazer and Emma Thompson, based on the fictional columns by Fielding. It is the third film in the franchise and a sequel to 2004 film \"\". The film stars Renée Zellweger as Bridget Jones, who after becoming pregnant is unsure if Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, also reprising his role) or Jack Qwant (Patrick Dempsey) is the father.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

He was dubbed the \"Poet of the Nile\", and sometimes the \"Poet of the People\", for his political commitment to the poor. His poetry took on the concerns of the majority of ordinary Egyptians, including women’s rights, poverty, education, as well as his criticism of the British Empire and foreign occupation.\n\n[2] The Love Songs of Hafiz: Although the texts are in German, this is a paraphrased version of Hafiz’s Persian poems by Hans Bethge. Hafiz of Shiraz, the original poet, was a supreme master of Persian ghazel poem in the 14th Century. The ghazel is a typical form of Persian lyrical poem in early middle-ages which have themes of love, wine, physical beauty, and intoxication. The most notable collection of the ghazels is called Divan-i Hafiz. This poetry is hugely influenced later poets not only in Persia but in other countries as well, and was later translated into many Western languages. Hafiz, who, unlike other Persian poets, embraced the humanist and tactile qualities of ecstasy on earth in relation to the ultimate pleasure when the earthly proved inadequate: death. Death as ecstasy is a vital theme throughout the texts, paraphrased by Hans Bethge, who also provided the translation for Gustav Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde. Hans Bethge, a German poet, scholar, and translator, was most famous for his translations of Oriental works rather than his poems. His unique but extraordinary musical versification inspired many composers such as Eisler, Krenek, Mahler, Strauss, Schoenberg, Ullmann, Webern, and Szymanowski. For Hafiz poems, Bethge did not miss the Persian impressionism in his translation. Hafiz’s poetic sensibility of “Pure ly\n\n[3] Hafez: His work was first translated into English in 1771 by William Jones. It would leave a mark on such Western writers as Thoreau, Goethe, and Ralph Waldo Emerson (the last referred to him as \"a poet's poet\").. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has his character Sherlock Holmes state that \"there is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world\" (in A Case of Identity). Friedrich Engels mentioned him in an 1853 letter to Karl Marx:\n\n[4] Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani: Hafiz Mehmood Shirani (1880 - 1946, ) was an Indian researcher and poet during the British era and father of famous Urdu poet Akhtar Sheerani. He started teaching Urdu at Islamia College, Lahore in 1921. In 1928 he moved to Oriental College, Lahore. He was a researcher and his popular theory was \"Punjab Mein Urdu\" which make him famous in Urdu searching field. Hafiz Mehmood Khan Shirani died in his native town of Tonk.\n\n[5] Hisham Hafiz: Hafiz was born on 28 April 1931 in Medina where his father and uncle founded the \"Al Madina\" newspaper in 1937. He and his brother Mohammad Hafiz worked at the paper during school holidays. He studied economics and political science at Cairo University while undertaking military studies at The Egyptian Military Academy. He completed his studies in 1955.\n\n[6] Helal Hafiz: Helal Hafiz (born 7 October 1948) is a Bangladeshi poet. He is considered a true representative of poets of his generation having certain creative traits in an age when his nation and countries in the neighbourhood witnessed dramatic transitions particularly in the arena of politics. He won Bangla Academy Literary Award (2013).\n\n[7] Daniel Ladinsky: He has written four works based on poetry of 14th-century Persian Sufi poet Hafiz: \"I Heard God Laughing\" (1996), \"The Subject Tonight Is Love\" (1996) \"The Gift\" (1999), and \"A Year With Hafiz:Daily Contemplations,\" (2011) as well as an anthology, \"Love Poems from God:Twelve Sacred Voices from the East and West\" (2002), and \"The Purity of Desire:100 Poems of Rumi\" (2012). In introductions to his books, Ladinsky notes that he offers interpretations and renderings of the poets, rather than literal or scholarly translations. His work is based on conveying and being \"faithful to the living spirit\" of Hafiz, Rumi, as well as other mystic poets. In 2017 Ladinsky published \"Darling, I Love You Poems from the Hearts of Our Glorious Mutts,\" featuring his original haiku, illustrated by Patrick McDonnell, creator of the internationally syndicated MUTTS comic strip.\n\n[8] Shiraz: Shiraz is proud of being mother land of Hafiz Shirazi, Shiraz is a center for Iranian culture and has produced a number of famous poets. Saadi, a 12th- and 13th-century poet was born in Shiraz. He left his native town at a young age for Baghdad to study Arabic literature and Islamic sciences at Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad. When he reappeared in his native Shiraz he was an elderly man. Shiraz, under Atabak Abubakr Sa'd ibn Zangy (1231–1260) was enjoying an era of relative tranquility. Saadi was not only welcomed to the city but he was highly respected by the ruler and enumerated among the greats of the province. He seems to have spent the rest of his life in Shiraz. Hafiz, another famous poet and mystic was also born in Shiraz. A number of scientists also originate from Shiraz. Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi, a 13th-century astronomer, mathematician, physician, physicist and scientist was from Shiraz. In his \"The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens\", he also discussed the possibility of heliocentrism.\n\n[9] Hafiz Rashid Khan: Hafiz Rashid Khan (, born June 23, 1961) is a Bangladeshi postcolonialist poet, author, editor and journalist. He wrote more than twenty-five titles including fifteen poetry and eight criticism. He is known for his postcolonialism and was reputed for working in tribal area at Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh.\n\n[10] Helal Hafiz: On completion of his schooling and college studies at his hometown in northern Netrokona, Hafiz got himself enrolled at the University of Dhaka, at a time when it appeared as main centre of the brewing nationalist movement which eventually saw the 1971 emergence of independent Bangladesh. He is considered a true representative of the poets of his generation. He studied at Netrokona Datta High School, Netrokona College and University of Dhaka. Hafiz earned the repute of being an established poet of verve, vigour and emptiness long ahead of the publication of his first collection of poems: Je Jale Agun Jwale (The water where fire is ignited) in 1986. It earned the best sellers status in Ekushey Book Fair of the year, discarding novels by popular writers who traditionally occupy the position in Bangladesh’s biggest annual book fair. \"Nishiddha Sampadakiya\" (The Banned Editorial), one of his most quoted poems inspired at least two generations since the pre-independence nationalist upsurge of 1969 and pro-democracy campaigns in post independence periods.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

These successes led to the nicknames Magnificent Seven, Fierce Five, and Final Five, respectively. They won three silvers in 1984, 2004, 2008 and three bronzes in 1948, 1992 and 2000. The 2016 team name referenced Márta Károlyi's final team to coach and that the team structure will be changed to four members beginning with the 2020 Olympic Games. The 1988 Olympic Games was the only year in which the team did not medal since its formation in 1982. The most decorated American gymnast at the Olympics is Shannon Miller with 7 medals (2 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze).\n\n[2] Michael Phelps: Phelps was a USA Olympic team member in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016, and holds the records for most Olympic gold medals (23), most such medals in individual events (13), and most such medals at a single games (8, in Beijing 2008).

The Americans started consistently winning Olympic and World team medals in the early 1990s with future Hall of Famers Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes. The 1996 Olympic team, known as the Magnificent Seven, was the first American team to win Olympic gold. An iconic moment in the sport's history came late in the competition, when an injured Kerri Strug stuck a vault to secure the title. After 1996, the team regressed for several years as their stars took breaks from competing.\n\n[4] Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics: Mixed High Performance Two Handed Dinghy (49er)Australia was very successful in the swimming venue at the 2000 Olympics.

East succeeded to the governorship when Andrew Johnson, who had served as military governor, became Vice President of the United States on March 4, 1865, and served as governor until April 5, when William \"Parson\" Brownlow was inaugurated as governor. The official \"Tennessee Blue Book\", published by the secretary of state's office, does not include East on its list of governors. As the Tennessee General Assembly ceased to meet during the Civil War and much of the ordinary process of government ceased effective function in the state, East had been appointed Secretary of State by Johnson. Those who recognize East's governorship do so on the theory that he was the highest-ranking remaining state official once Johnson had become Vice President.\n\n[2] John Shelton Wilder: John Shelton Wilder (June 3, 1921 – January 1, 2010) was an American politician who was the 48th Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee for 36 years from January 1971 to January 2007, when he was defeated, possibly the longest time anyone has served as Lieutenant Governor or a similar position in the history of the United States. He was a Tennessee state senator from 1959 to 1961 and again from 1967 to 2009. Tennesseans do not elect their lieutenant governor; rather, the Speaker of the Senate, who is first in the line of succession to the governor, is granted the title by statute.\n\n[3] List of Governors of Tennessee: , there are five former governors who are currently living at this time, the oldest being Winfield Dunn (served 1971–1975, born 1927). The most recent death of a former Tennessee governor was that of Ned McWherter (served 1987–1995, born 1930), on April 4, 2011, who is also the most recently serving governor to have died.\n\n[4] James C. Jones: James Chamberlain Jones (April 20, 1809October 29, 1859) was an American politician who served as the Governor of Tennessee from 1841 to 1845, and as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1851 to 1857. A Whig, Jones twice defeated rising politician James K. Polk for the governorship (in 1841 and 1843). He was the first native-born Tennessean to be elected governor.\n\n[5] List of lieutenant governors of Tennessee: The following is a list of people who have served as Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee (formal title: \"Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the Senate\") since the current Tennessee State Constitution was adopted in 1870. The title of Lieutenant Governor was formally added in 1951; however, the Speaker of the Senate has been the designated successor to the Governor of Tennessee since Tennessee achieved statehood in 1796. Lieutenant Governor Ron Ramsey (who served 2007-2017) is the first Republican to hold this office since the adoption of the current constitution, all others having been Democrats.1 John I. Cox became governor of Tennessee on March 21, 1905 when Governor James B. Frazier arranged his own appointment to a vacant United States Senate seat and then resigned as governor.\n\n[6] Frank Gorrell: In 1947, while a student at Vanderbilt, he married Bette Jamison, which connected him to the powerful Middle Tennessee Jamison family, whose interests included a mattress factory near downtown Franklin, Tennessee. In 1964, Governor Frank G. Clement decided that he desired Gorrell to be lieutenant governor to replace the outgoing James L. Bomar. The Tennessee General Assembly had begun to show a measure of independence from the executive branch of government in this era, but was generally still largely subject to it. However, a faction of the Democratic Caucus in the Tennessee State Senate, which in Tennessee elects the lieutenant governor from its own members, had decided to resist the selection of Gorrell. They were joined by the relatively small Republican Caucus, which proposed the election of former lieutenant governor Jared Maddux, who had previously served as lieutenant governor during Clement's first administration.\n\n[7] Winfield Dunn: Bryant Winfield Culberson Dunn (born July 1, 1927) is an American businessman, politician, medical industry official, and dentist who served as Governor of Tennessee from 1971 to 1975. He was the state's first Republican governor in fifty years, and was just the sixth since the Civil War. Dunn was an unsuccessful candidate for a second term in 1986, losing to Ned McWherter. He has remained active in the Republican Party and the medical field since the end of his term as governor.\n\n[8] John I. Cox: John Isaac Cox (November 23, 1855 – September 5, 1946) was an American politician who served as Governor of Tennessee from 1905 to 1907. He was elevated to the position when Governor James B. Frazier resigned, and, as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, he was the first in the line of succession. He failed to win his party's nomination for a second term, and returned to the state senate, where he remained until 1911. Cox also served as a county judge, city attorney, and local postmaster, and spent two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives.\n\n[9] Governor of Tennessee: Governor William Blount served from 1790 to 1796, when Tennessee was known as the Southwest Territory. He was replaced by John Sevier, the state's first governor. Other notable governors include Willie Blount (William's half-brother), Sam Houston (better known for his role as the President of the Republic of Texas), and future U.S Presidents James K. Polk and Andrew Johnson.\n\n[10] Tennessee: Similar to the United States Federal Government, Tennessee's government has three parts. The Executive Branch is led by Tennessee's governor, who holds office for a four-year term and may serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. The governor is the only official who is elected statewide. Unlike most states, the state does not elect the lieutenant governor directly; the Tennessee Senate elects its Speaker, who serves as lieutenant governor. The governor is supported by 22 cabinet-level departments, most headed by a commissioner who serves at the pleasure of the governor: The Executive Branch also includes several agencies, boards and commissions, some of which are under the auspices of one of the cabinet-level departments.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nPlease note that the answer is present in the context [5].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know who the second Governor of Tennessee was?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Jackson appeared in advertisements for Sky Broadband.\n\n[2] Captain America: The Winter Soldier (soundtrack): Captain America: The Winter Soldier (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the film score for the Marvel Studios film, \"\" by Henry Jackman, which was released by Hollywood Records on April 1, 2014.\n\n[3] Captain America: The Winter Soldier: In August 2013, Feige, Evans, Stan, and Mackie presented a clip of the film at Disney's D23 Expo. In September 2013, Marvel announced that it is again partnering with Harley-Davidson, continuing their relationship from \"Captain America: The First Avenger\", with Captain America riding the company's Softail Breakout motorcycle in the film. In October 2013, Marvel released the first trailer for \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\". \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"it looks like it'll live up to the 'political thriller' that's been promised for months now.\" \"The Los Angeles Times\" said, \"[the] trailer runs 21⁄2 minutes and teases plenty of action, conspiracy and clever banter between Captain America and his S.H.I.E.L.D. colleagues, with a smattering of the previously released Comic-Con International and D23 footage.\" \"The Los Angeles Times\" also noted that the day before the release of the trailer, the studio released \"a teaser for a trailer.\" The trailer received 23.5 million views in the 24 hours after its release. In November 2013, Jed Whedon, the co-creator of the television series \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", said that there are plans to reference events from the film into the show, stating, \"Nick Fury is in [\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\"], and S.H.I.E.L.D. makes an appearance, so we will definitely try to tee-\n\n[4] List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films: A sequel to 2011's \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" was announced in April 2012. Anthony and Joe Russo were hired to direct in June, and in July it was officially titled \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\". Evans and Jackson were set to reprise their respective roles as Captain America and Nick Fury, and Johansson would again play the Black Widow. Sebastian Stan, who portrayed Bucky Barnes in \"Captain America: The First Avenger\", returned as the Winter Soldier. Production started in April 2013 in Manhattan Beach, California, and filming also took place in Washington, D.C. and Cleveland, Ohio. The film premiered in Los Angeles on March 13, 2014. \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" was released internationally on March 26 and in the United States on April 4.\n\n[5] Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a 2014 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Captain America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2011's \"\" and the ninth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, alongside Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smulders, Frank Grillo, Emily VanCamp, Hayley Atwell, Robert Redford, and Samuel L. Jackson. In \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", Captain America, Black Widow, and Falcon join forces to uncover a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier.\n\n[6] Captain America: Civil War: In an April 2014 interview, Joe Russo described the project as a continuation of the story from \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\": \"What's nice about the film is that ... it's a two-parter. There's a journey that the Winter Soldier goes on that isn't complete yet.\" That month, Marvel announced a release date of May 6, 2016, and Trent Opaloch, who was the cinematographer on \"The Winter Soldier\", said he would return for the sequel. In July, Markus and McFeely stated that they were midway through a first draft for the film, on which principal photography was expected to begin in April 2015. The following month, they stated that they were looking to make the tone of the film \"an amalgam\" of \"The First Avenger\" and \"The Winter Soldier\", with the Russos likening it to a psychological thriller, citing \"Seven\", \"Fargo\", and \"The Godfather\" as influences, along with westerns and Brian De Palma's films. The Russos also stated that \"a good portion of [\"Civil War\" is] actually funnier than \"Winter Soldier\"\" with a more comedic tone and lighter moments throughout.\n\n[7] Captain America: The Winter Soldier: In September 2012, Chris Evans stated that filming would begin in March 2013. Evans also stated that Rogers' adjustment to the modern world, which was originally set to be included in \"The Avengers\", would be better suited for \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\". At the end of the month, The Greater Cleveland Film Commission announced that \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" would film in Cleveland, Ohio after the production was approved for a $9.5 million tax credit. Producer Nate Moore said that after also serving as a location in \"The Avengers\", Cleveland's government was helpful in providing large locations for filming, which \"provided production value which we probably could not have built in a backlot.\" McFeely joked that while writing ambitious action scenes \"I did not realize a great American metropolis would say 'Sure, shut down three miles of freeway and go to town'.\" Portions of the film were also scheduled to be shot in California and Washington, D.C.\n\n[8] Captain America: The Winter Soldier: The first televised advertisement for \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" aired during Super Bowl XLVIII on February 2, 2014. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Disney paid over $4 million per 30-second spot. The \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"The clip promoting the April 4 release had a recognizably melancholy tone as Chris Evans' patriotic hero grapples with the moral ambiguities of the modern age.\" Also in February, Gameloft announced that a mobile video game, titled \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier – The Official Game\", would be released in conjunction with the release of the film in late March 2014 for iOS and Android platforms. A few days later General Motors announced that Chevrolet partnered with Marvel Entertainment and provided a specially designed Corvette Stingray C7 for use by the Black Widow in the film. The vehicle debuted at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show, where fans received limited-edition Captain America comic books. Evans was named the grand marshal of the 2014 Daytona 500 to promote the film's release. Later in the month, a 30-second television spot received \"a lot of attention on social media\" for a line featured in the clip. The line, which was said by Captain America, suggests that Nick Fury would die in the film. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that it all seemed \"a bit too obvious\", noting the fact that Jackson, who plays Fury, is reprising the role in \"\", although pointing out that it could be in a post\n\n[9] Captain America: The Winter Soldier: Conversely, Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"[\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\"] is everything a big budget superhero film should be – except inspired.\" Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said, \"Like many others of its type, [\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\"] gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up.\" Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" said, \"You can't help but feel disappointment that a film with a relatively spicy premise becomes, in the end, so risk-averse.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said the film \"has the usual overlong running time [for the comic book superhero genre], the halfhearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible.\" Joe Williams of the \"St. Louis Post Dispatch\" felt \"On paper this sequel has some promising elements, but on screen it retreats from the very issues that it raises, and on a shelf next to \"Captain America: The First Avenger\", \"The Winter Soldier\" is pale.\" Jake Coyle of the \"Associated Press\" said the film's biggest misstep was the handling of Stan's Winter Soldier, and that it was \"getting difficult to tell the Marvel movies apart\".\n\n[10] Captain America: The Winter Soldier: In January 2014, Disney announced that in honor of the film, Captain America would be making appearances at Disneyland. The meet and greet experience opened March 7, 2014 and is called \"Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage\", located at Innoventions in Tomorrowland. Also in January, Marvel Comics released a prelude digital comic titled, \"Marvel's Captain America: The Winter Soldier Infinite Comic\", written by Peter David, with art by Rock-He Kim. The comic sees the return of the \"Zodiac\", the mysterious weapon first seen in the One-Shot \"Agent Carter\", which has fallen into the wrong hands. Captain America, Black Widow, and Rumlow must track the weapon down and put it back in S.H.I.E.L.D. protection.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat group of animals would be in a clowder?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Darwin IV: All species in \"Alien Planet\" were mentioned or depicted in \"Expedition\"; however, it should be noted that the Electrophyte was only briefly depicted in the book and was only fully explained in \"Alien Planet\".In his Expedition, Barlowe clearly states that he wanted to represent the most impressive, most appealing animals of the planet. There are millions of species who are not represented in detail, even though they have to be an essential part of Darwin IV's ecosystem. Barlowe refers to them as the 'microflyers', tiny animals and plants living in the atmosphere of the planet like plankton lives in the oceans of Earth. Most animals represented in both the book and the movie belong to one of two essential groups: the floaters and the ground-dwelling species. However, there is a great variety inside the landdweller family. While on Earth animals are classified by characteristics such as mode of reproduction and metabolism, the large Darwinian animals are classified by their number of limbs. There are four classes: quadrupedalians, tripedalians, bipedalians and monopedalians. However, sometimes it is difficult to say to which group an animal belongs. In fact many animals lose some of their limbs when they grow up, and thus \"change\" their classification. The forest slider, for instance, has four legs as a juvenile, but only two legs in its adult form. Most Floaters \n\n[2] Biostatistics: As an example, consider groups of similar animals (mice, for example) under two different diet systems. The research question would be: what is the best diet? In this case, H would be that there is no difference between the two diets in mice metabolism (H: μ = μ) and the alternative hypothesis would be that the diets have different effects over animals metabolism (H: μ ≠ μ).\n\n[3] Stu Maddux: The Clowder Group is the production company founded and used by Maddux and his husband, Joseph Applebaum, to produce and distribute their independent films. The company was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.\n\n[4] Acheroraptor: Mammals are plentiful in the Hell Creek Formation. Groups represented include multituberculates, metatherians, and eutherians. The multituberculates represented include \"Paracimexomys\", the cimolomyids \"Paressonodon\", \"Meniscoessus\", \"Essonodon\", \"Cimolomys\", \"Cimolodon\", and \"Cimexomys\"; and the neoplagiaulacids \"Mesodma\", and \"Neoplagiaulax\". The alphadontids \"Alphadon\", \"Protalphodon\", and \"Turgidodon\", pediomyids \"Pediomys\", \"Protolambda\", and \"Leptalestes\", the stagodontid \"Didelphodon\", the deltatheridiid \"Nanocuris\", the herpetotheriid \"Nortedelphys\", and the glasbiid \"Glasbius\" all represent metatherians of the Hell Creek Formation. A few eutherians are known, being represented by \"Alostera\", \"Protungulatum\", the cimolestids \"Cimolestes\" and \"Batodon\", the gypsonictopsid \"Gypsonictops\", and the possible nyctitheriid \"Paranyctoides\".\n\n[5] Animal Collective: Worrying that \"Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Deakin and Geologist\" would be too long-winded a moniker, and with record companies advising that a unifying name would be necessary for the marketplace, the group decided to adopt a catch-all name. Using their old label of Animal as inspiration they picked \"Animal Collective\". This formation was to be different from a straightforward band, giving the musicians the freedom to work in combinations of two to four, as dictated by the project at hand or their mood. Their first entry under this name was \"Here Comes the Indian\", which was released in 2003 by their newly formed record label, Paw Tracks, formed with Carpark Records' Todd Hyman. Animal Collective makes decisions on what Paw Tracks is to release, while Hyman runs the day-to-day operations. The group was happy to find someone like Hyman, who had experience running a label and was dedicated to the group's music; the Animal label was more or less abandoned upon the formation of Paw Tracks. \"Here Comes the Indian\" was the first record to feature all four of Animal Collective.\n\n[6] Foraging: The theory scientists use to understand group foraging is called the Ideal free distribution. This is the null model for thinking about what would draw animals into groups to forage and how they would behave in the process. This model predicts that animals will make an instantaneous decision about where to forage based on the quality (prey availability) of the patches available at that time and will choose the most profitable patch, the one that maximizes their energy intake. This quality depends on the starting quality of the patch and the number of predators already there consuming the prey.\n\n[7] West Stow: One of the more interesting findings with regards to what was found is that which deals with the farming aspect of this culture. This village, and others like it, replaced Roman farms after the imperial administration left Britain. The Anglo-Saxons settled in small villages that were generally self-sustaining. Within these self-sustaining communities there is evidence that these peoples were more likely to provide for themselves through a farming lifestyle than a foraging one. Within the archaeological remains there were more domesticated animal species found than wild animal species, which also suggests that this group were less dependent on hunting as a means of survival, and supports the idea that they were farmers. The settlers in this area were thought to be from a different area, with German descent being the most likely area, and as such it is interesting to see what farming techniques may be employed by this group. Since the landscapes are quite different, it would be interesting to see if the newly settled group would use a German style of farming in this new terrain. This area helps to provide some insight into these farming adaptations. Within animal husbandry, however, this group was more likely to use elements found within the native system of the country.\n\n[8] List of birds of Connecticut: The family Corvidae includes crows, ravens, jays, choughs, magpies, treepies, nutcrackers, and ground jays. Corvids are above average in size among the Passeriformes, and some of the larger species show high levels of intelligence. Five species have been recorded in Connecticut.Order: PasseriformesFamily: Alaudidae\n\n[9] Animal cracker: Cadburys Animals are chocolate coated and feature crocodile, elephant, hippo, monkey, lion, tiger, and toucan. Stauffer's animal crackers include an American bison, bear, camel, cow, cat, donkey, elephant, hippo, horse, lion, mountain goat, rhino, and tiger. They are made in plain (vanilla), chocolate graham, cinnamon graham, cotton candy and iced flavors, as well as \"breakfast cookies\" made with oats, almonds, cranberries, and pomegranate.\n\n[10] List of birds of Connecticut: Falconidae is a family of diurnal birds of prey, notably the falcons and caracaras.

The synagogue is located in the Jewish district taking up several blocks in central Budapest bordered by Király utca, Wesselényi utca, Grand Boulevard and Bajcsy Zsilinszky road. It was built in moorish revival style in 1859 and has a seating capacity of 3,000. Adjacent to it is a sculpture reproducing a weeping willow tree in steel to commemorate the Hungarian victims of the Holocaust.\n\n[2] Central Synagogue, Sydney: The Central Synagogue of Bondi Junction, Sydney, is the largest synagogue in the Southern hemisphere and has the largest Jewish congregation in Australasia. It is located in Bon Accord Avenue and extends back to Kenilworth Street. It was constructed at its present location in 1960 after originally being located in Paddington and then Bondi. It was burned down in 1994 by a devastating fire caused by an electrical fault. The synagogue was rebuilt and reopened in 1998. Hineni is the official youth movement of Central Synagogue.\n\n[3] Paravur Synagogue: The Paravur Synagogue is among the oldest Synagogues that still exist in Kerala and is also the largest Synagogue complex. The current synagogue was built in 1615 AD at the Jewish street of Paravur and very close to the Paravur Market where the Jewish community had settled and worked as traders. However, traditional accounts hint at a much older heritage, indicating that it was built on top of the ruins of an older synagogue dated 1165 AD.\n\n[4] Hurva Synagogue: From 1864 onwards, the Hurva Synagogue was considered the most beautiful and most important synagogue in the Land of Israel. It was described as \"the glory of the Old City\" and the \"most striking edifice in all of Palestine\". It also housed part of the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, the largest yeshiva in Jerusalem. It was a focal point of Jewish spiritual life in the city and was the site of the installation of the Ashkenazic chief rabbis of both Palestine and Jerusalem. On his visit to Jerusalem in 1866, Moses Montefiore went to the synagogue, placing a silver breastplate on one of the Torah scrolls. When he visited again in 1875, a crowd of 3,000 Jews turned out to greet him. On February 3, 1901 a memorial service for Queen Victoria took place inside the synagogue in gratitude for the protection afforded to the Jews of Jerusalem by Britain. The service was presided over by the Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Shmuel Salant. According to a report in \"The Jewish Chronicle\", the large building was \"filled to its utmost capacity and policemen had to keep off the crowds, who vainly sought admission, by force\". In around 1919, Benjamin Lee Gordon wrote that the \"synagogue presented a very pleasant and dignified appearance. It was well illuminated with artistic lamps presented by a certain Mr. Lichtenstein, of Philadelphia\". In 1921 Abraham Isaac Kook was appointed first Chief Rabbi of Palestine at\n\n[5] Rykestrasse Synagogue: Rykestrasse Synagogue, Germany's largest synagogue, is located in the Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood in the Pankow borough of Berlin. built the synagogue in 1903/1904. It was inaugurated on 4 September 1904, in time for the holidays of and around Rosh haShana. The synagogue stands off the street alignment and is reached by a thoroughfare in the pertaining front building.\n\n[6] Synagoge Zürich Löwenstrasse: The Synagoge Zürich Löwenstrasse is the oldest and largest synagogue in the Swiss municipality of Zürich. In 1884 built in \"Moorish style\", the oldest Synagogue of Zürich also houses the prayer and school house of Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich (ICZ) which was founded in 1862. ICZ is a unified Jewish community having about 2,500 members, and thus the largest Jewish community in Switzerland, which since 2007 in the Canton of Zürich is recognized as a denomination, i.e. ICZ has the same legal state as the Christian denomiations. In the synagogue, the community celebrates the daily Minyan and Shabbat and holiday services. The synagogue is a cultural heritage of national importance in Switzerland.\n\n[7] Hungary: Hungary is home to the largest synagogue in Europe (Great Synagogue), built in 1859 in Moorish Revival style with a capacity of 3000 people, the largest medicinal bath in Europe (Széchenyi Medicinal Bath), completed in 1913 in Modern Renaissance Style and located in the City park, the biggest building in Hungary with its length (the Parliament building), one of the largest basilicas in Europe (Esztergom Basilica), the second largest territorial abbey in the world (Pannonhalma Archabbey), and the largest early Christian necropolis outside Italy (Pécs).\n\n[8] Yusef Abad Synagogue: The Yusef Abad Synagogue ( \"Kanise e Yusef Ābād\", ) is one of the largest synagogues in Tehran, Iran. The official name of the Yusef Abad Synagogue is Sukkot Shalom Synagogue. The original building that housed the synagogue was completed in the early 1950s. With the growth of the Jewish population of the capital especially in the Yusef Abad neighborhood, it was decided that a newer building was needed. With the help of local community leaders headed by Avraham Yusian, the construction of the new facade was completed in October 1965. The doors of the new synagogue were opened to the public on Rosh Hashanah 5726 (Hebrew calendar).\n\n[9] Dohány Street Synagogue: Built in a residential area between 1854-1859 by the Jewish community of Pest according to the plans of Ludwig Förster, the monumental synagogue has a capacity of 2,964 seats (1,492 for men and 1,472 in the women's galleries), making it the largest in Europe and one of the largest working synagogues in the world (after the Beit Midrash of Ger in Jerusalem, the Belz Great Synagogue and Temple Emanu-el in New York City). The consecration of the synagogue took place on 6 September 1859.\n\n[10] Jewish Museum of Maryland: The museum is the only museum in America with two historic synagogues, preserved and interpreted for the public. The first is the Lloyd Street Synagogue, a Greek revival design by architect Robert Cary Long, Jr. which was finished in 1845. The second is the B'nai Israel Synagogue, which was designed in a modified Moorish revival style by Henry Berge and finished in 1876. Both synagogues are situated in the heart of an historic Jewish neighborhood where they tell the stories of two great waves of Jewish immigrants to Baltimore, the second largest port of immigration in the United States. In these restored synagogues you can explore a matzoh oven, mikvehs (ritual baths), a magnificent hand-carved Torah Ark, women's balconies, and an active archaeology dig. B'nai Israel synagogue is an active Modern Orthodox synagogue of 200 families with services every Shabbat and Jewish Holy Day.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present (in contexts [1], [4], [6], [9])\nNo answer (in contexts [2], [3], [5], [7], [8], [10])", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

While he would recover, his health would be poor for the rest of his life. The fact that he was required to report to his Principality of Qinghe (in modern central Hebei) after his brother's death probably did not help. However, Emperor He's wife Empress Dowager Deng Sui, because Emperor He's son Emperor Shang was still an infant, ordered that Prince Qing's wife Consort Geng and his son Liu Hu (by his concubine Consort Zuo Xiao'e (左小娥)) remain in the capital to serve as a potential successor. When Emperor Shang died later in 106, instead of making Emperor Shang's older brother Liu Sheng (劉勝) the Prince of Pingyuan emperor, Empress Deng made Prince Hu emperor, as Emperor An, due to her concerns that Prince Sheng would bear a grudge for not having been selected first. Empress Deng sent Consort Geng to Qinghe to join Prince Qing and dominated the government, and there was no sign that Prince Qing had significant input into his son's early reign.\n\n[2] Zhang Yao'er: Emperor Wen honored Empress Zhang as empress dowager, and she took up residence at Cixun Palace (慈訓宮). She did not appear to have much power during Emperor Wen's reign, and in 560, when Chen Chang returned from Northern Zhou and made suggestions that he would contest the throne, Emperor Wen had him drowned. In 566, Emperor Wen died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Fei, who honored her as grand empress dowager. In 569, when Chen Xu (who had by this time returned from Northern Zhou as well) seized the throne from Emperor Fei, he had the edict deposing Emperor Fei and making him emperor (as Emperor Xuan) issued in her name, although there is no evidence suggesting that she was actually involved in Emperor Xuan's seizure of the throne. After Emperor Xuan took the throne, she was again titularly empress dowager. She died in 570 and was buried with honors due an empress, with her husband Emperor Wu.\n\n[3] Zhao Feng: Emperor Mingzong died in 933 and was succeeded by his biological son Li Conghou the Prince of Song (as Emperor Min). In 934, Emperor Min's leading advisors Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun, not wanting Shi Jingtang (who was then the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi)) and Li Congke (who was then the military governor of Fengxiang) to be entrenched, tried to move them both. Li Congke, believing that they had unfriendly intentions toward him, rebelled, and quickly advanced on Luoyang, forcing Emperor Min to flee to Wei Prefecture (衛州, in modern Xinxiang, Henan). When Zhao heard this, he initially wanted to take his soldiers and staff and immediately head to Wei Prefecture to attend to Emperor Min — despite the dangers such an action might have — and the soldiers were initially willing to follow him. He never carried out the journey, however, before news came that Emperor Min had been killed by emissaries sent by Li Congke.\n\n[4] Emperor An of Han: When Emperor He died in 106, his infant son, Emperor Shang, ascended the throne. Most of Emperor He's brothers, including Prince Qing, remained in the palace at Luoyang but were ordered to report to their principalities. As an insurance measure, Emperor He's wife, Empress Dowager Deng, kept Prince Qing's wife and 12-year-old son (Prince Hu). When Emperor Shang died later in 106, the officials largely wanted to make Emperor Shang's brother, Prince Sheng (劉勝) of Pingyuan, emperor. However, Empress Deng had initially denied Prince Sheng the throne because she believed him to be frequently ill; she was concerned that he would bear a grudge against her. At her insistence, Prince Hu ascended the throne as Emperor An.\n\n[5] Li Jiongxiu: Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly in 705—a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by his wife Empress Wei and daughter Li Guo'er the Princess Anle. In turn, Empress Wei and Princess Anle were killed in a coup led by Emperor Zhongzong's sister Princess Taiping and nephew Li Longji the Prince of Linzi, who then supported Li Longji's father, Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, to be emperor again (as Emperor Ruizong). Li Jiongxiu's responsibilities during the initial stages of Emperor Ruizong's reign were unclear, but it appeared that he was at one point commissioned to command an army either intending to attack or to defend against an attack from Eastern Tujue, and upon his return from that mission, after the chancellor Yao Chong, who was serving as minister of defense as well, was removed in 711, Li Jiongxiu became minister of defense again, but not chancellor. The last historical reference to an act of Li Jiongxiu's was in 713, shortly before Emperor Ruizong passed the throne to Li Longji (as Emperor Xuanzong), when Li Jiongxiu was again put in command of an army either to attack or defend against an attack by Eastern Tujue. It is not known exactly when Li Jiongxiu died, although he was said to die at age 49 and was buried with honor.\n\n[6] Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus: When Trajan died on August 8, 117, his cousin and adopted son Hadrian became emperor. As Emperor, Hadrian treated Servianus with distinguished honor, considering him to be his first successor. When Paulina died in 130, Hadrian and Servianus shared a private ceremony for her. For a long time, the emperor Hadrian had considered Servianus as his unofficial successor. As Hadrian's reign drew to a close, however, he changed his mind. Although the emperor certainly thought Servianus capable of ruling as an emperor after Hadrian's own death, Servianus, by now in his nineties, was clearly too old for the position. Hadrian's attentions turned to Servianus' grandson, who was also named Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator like his father. Hadrian promoted the young Salinator, his great-nephew, gave him special status in his court, and groomed him as his heir. Servianus, who always cherished the idea that his youthful grandson would one day succeed his brother-in-law, was overjoyed.\n\n[7] Du You: When Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Shunzong, Du You served as regent for several days before Emperor Shunzong officially took over the reins of the state. Soon thereafter, Du was again put in charge of the financial matters of the state, with Emperor Shunzong's close associate Wang Shuwen as his deputy — as Wang, who was powerful at the time, believed that it would be more appropriate to serve as deputy to the senior Du. Several months later, however, when Wang Shuwen's mother died and he had to leave official service to observe a mourning period for her, Wang's partisans lost power. Wang's ally Wang Pi made repeated requests to Du for him to intercede to recall Wang Shuwen from his mourning period, but Du was either unwilling or unable to. Soon thereafter, Emperor Shunzong, who was seriously ill, yielded the throne to his son Emperor Xianzong, and Wang Shuwen and his associates were almost immediately purged.\n\n[8] Theodora Palaiologina (Byzantine empress): John III died on 3 November 1254. He was succeeded by his only son Theodore II Laskaris, who died four years later leaving his only son John IV Laskaris, a youth of seven. Michael maneuvered his way into first becoming regent of John IV, then advancing step by step to \"despotes\" making him next in order to Emperor. The final step came at the beginning of 1259 when Michael and John were crowned as co-emperors. There is no clear indication that Theodora was crowned empress at this time, but Alice-Mary Talbot notes the historian George Pachymeres contrasts the imperial couple with the young John who wore less impressive regalia.\n\n[9] Leo IV the Khazar: Leo IV \"the Khazar\" (Greek: Λέων Δ ́ ὁ Χάζαρος, \"Leōn IV ho Khazaros\"; 25 January 750 – 8 September 780) was Byzantine Emperor from 775 to 780 AD. He was born to Emperor Constantine V and Empress Tzitzak in 750. He was elevated to caesar the next year, in 751. When Constantine V died in September 775, while campaigning against the Bulgarians, Leo IV became senior emperor on 14 September 775. In 778 Leo raided Abbasid Syria, decisively defeating the Abbasid army outside of Germanicia. Leo died on 8 September 780, of tuberculosis. He was succeeded by his son Constantine VI, who was eventually overthrown by Leo's wife Irene, who installed herself as empress.\n\n[10] Chen Miaodeng: After Emperor Ming died in 472, Crown Prince Yu took the throne as Emperor Houfei. Consort Chen was honored as \"Consort Dowager\" (皇太妃), but not as empress dowager—that title was given to Emperor Ming's wife Empress Wang. Initially, both Empress Dowager Wang and Consort Dowager Chen were able to somewhat rein the young emperor in, but by 477, they had nearly lost all control over him, who spent day and night outside the palace with his attendants, killing anyone or anything that came near them. When he considered killing his general Xiao Daocheng, Consort Chen rebuked him and persuaded him not to—stating to him that Xiao had greatly contributed to his reign (by having suppressed the rebellion of his uncle Liu Xiufan (劉休範) the Prince of Guiyang in 473) and that if he killed Xiao, no one would again be loyal to him. Xiao, in fear, nevertheless persuaded Emperor Houfei's attendant Yang Yufu (楊玉夫) to assassinate him in fall 477, making Emperor Houfei's brother Liu Zhun the Prince of Ancheng emperor. Emperor Houfei was posthumously demoted to the title of Prince of Cangwu, and Consort Dowager Chen was accordingly demoted to the title of Princess Dowager of Cangwu. Nothing further is known about her, and it is not known when she died.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nWho was emperor when Jesus died?\n\nPlease select one of the following options:\n\nA) Emperor He of Han\nB) Emperor An of Han\nC) Emperor Wen of Zhou\nD) Emperor Xu of", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It completed the invasion and occupation of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 under Sultan Mehmet II by conquering Constantinople and Galata. It seized Genoa's last bastions in the Black Sea in 1475 and Venice's Greek colony of Euboea in 1479. Turkish troops invaded the Friuli region in northeastern Italy in 1479 and again in 1499–1503. The Apulian harbor town of Otranto, located about 100 kilometers southeast of Brindisi, was seized in 1480, but the Turks were routed there in 1481 when Mehmet died and a war for his succession broke out. Cem Sultan, pretender to the Ottoman throne, was defeated despite being supported by the pope; he fled with his family to the Kingdom of Naples, where his male descendants were bestowed with the title of Principe de Sayd by the Pope in 1492. They lived in Naples until the 17th century and in Sicily until 1668 before relocating to Malta (Turkic Italian: Итољйон Тұрклори.\n\n[2] Islam in Italy: During this century, the Ottoman Empire was expanding mightily in southeastern Europe. It completed the absorption of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 under Sultan Mehmet II by conquering Constantinople and Galata.

The Apulian harbor town of Otranto, located about 100 kilometers southeast of Brindisi, was seized in 1480 (Ottoman invasion of Otranto), but the Turks were routed there in 1481 by an alliance of several Italian city-states, Hungary and France led by the prince Alphonso II of Naples, when Mehmet died and a war for his succession broke out. Cem Sultan, pretender to the Ottoman throne, was defeated despite being supported by the pope; he fled with his family to the Kingdom of Naples, where his male descendants were bestowed with the title of Principe de Sayd by the Pope in 1492. They lived in Naples until the 17th century and in Sicily until 1668 before relocating to Malta.\n\n[3] Italian Wars: Francis I, King of France, allied himself once more with Suleiman I of the Ottoman Empire and on July 12, 1542 declared war on the Holy Roman Empire. Francis I launched his final invasion of Italy against the town of Perpignan. A Franco-Ottoman fleet under the command of Ottoman admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the city of Nice on August 22, 1543, and laid siege to the citadel. The defenders of the citadel were relieved within a month. For Christian and Islamic troops to act in coordination to attack a Christian town was regarded as shocking. Thus, in this attack on Nice, King Francis needed to play down the role of the Ottoman Turks. However, Francis I did something even more scandalous when he turned the French naval port of Toulon over to Barbarossa to use as winter quarters for the Ottoman fleet.\n\n[4] Causes of World War I: In the Italo-Turkish War or Turco-Italian War Italy defeated the Ottoman Empire in North Africa in 1911-12. Italy easily captured the important coastal cities but its army failed to advance far into the interior. Italy captured the Ottoman Tripolitania Vilayet (province), of which the most notable sub-provinces (sanjaks) were Fezzan, Cyrenaica, and Tripoli itself. These territories together formed what became known as Italian Libya. The main significance for the First World War was that this war made it clear that no Great Power appeared to wish to support the Ottoman Empire any longer and this paved the way for the Balkan Wars. Christopher Clark stated: \"Italy launched a war of conquest on an African province of the Ottoman Empire, triggering a chain of opportunistic assaults on Ottoman territories across the Balkans. The system of geographical balances that had enabled local conflicts to be contained was swept away.\"\n\n[5] Sanaʽa: The Ottoman Empire entered Yemen in 1538 when Suleiman the Magnificent was Sultan. Under the military leadership of Özdemir Pasha, the Ottomans conquered Sanaʽa in 1547. With Ottoman approval, European captains based in the Yemeni port towns of Aden and Mocha frequented Sanaʽa to maintain special privileges and capitulations for their trade. In 1602 the local Zaydi imams led by Imam al-Mu'ayyad reasserted their control over the area, and forced out Ottoman troops in 1629. Although the Ottomans fled during al-Mu'ayyad's reign, his predecessor al-Mansur al-Qasim had already vastly weakened the Ottoman army in Sanaʽa and Yemen. Consequently, European traders were stripped of their previous privileges.\n\n[6] Territorial evolution of the Ottoman Empire: The Italo-Turkish or (also known in Italy as \"guerra di Libia\", \"the Libyan war\", and in Turkey as \"Trablusgarp Savaşı\") was fought between the Ottoman Empire and Italy from September 29, 1911 to October 18, 1912. Italy seized the Ottoman provinces of and , together forming what became known as Libya. Following the First Balkan War, the Autonomous Principality of Samos, an Ottoman tributary state, was annexed to Greece in November 1912. Bulgaria was lost to the Ottomans after more than 500 years of continuous rule. See figure, right.\n\n[7] History of colonialism: In the same manner, Italy tried to conquer its \"place in the sun,\" acquiring Somaliland in 1899–90, Eritrea and 1899, and, taking advantage of the \"Sick man of Europe,\" the Ottoman Empire, also conquered Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (modern Libya) with the 1911 Treaty of Lausanne. The conquest of Ethiopia, which had remained the last African independent territory, had to wait till the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in 1935–36 (the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1895–96 had ended in defeat for Italy).\n\n[8] Islam in Europe: Between 1354 (when the Ottomans crossed into Europe at Gallipoli) and 1526, the Empire had conquered the territory of present-day Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and Hungary. The Empire laid siege to Vienna in 1683. The intervention of the Polish King broke the siege, and from then afterwards the Ottomans battled the Habsburg Emperors until 1699, when the Treaty of Karlowitz forced them to surrender Hungary and portions of present-day Croatia, Slovenia, and Serbia. From 1699 to 1913, wars and insurrections pushed the Ottoman Empire further back until it reached the current European border of present-day Turkey.\n\n[9] Classical Age of the Ottoman Empire: The Ottoman Empire of the Classical Age experienced dramatic territorial growth. The period opened with the conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed II (r. 1451-1481) in 1453. Mehmed II went on to consolidate the empire's position in the Balkans and Anatolia, conquering Serbia in 1454-5, the Peloponnese in 1458-9, Trebizond in 1461, and Bosnia in 1463. Many Venetian territories in Greece were conquered during the 1463-79 Ottoman-Venetian War. By 1474 the Ottomans had conquered their Anatolian rival the Karamanids, and in 1475 conquered Kaffa on the Crimean Peninsula, establishing the Crimean Khanate as a vassal state. In 1480 an invasion of Otranto in Italy was launched, but the death of Mehmed II the following year led to an Ottoman withdrawal.\n\n[10] Battle of Tripoli (1911): The Kingdom of Italy, seeking to conquer Libya from the Ottoman Empire, declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 29 September 1911, starting the Italo-Turkish War. After the declaration of war, an Italian naval squadron under Admiral Luigi Faravelli was sent to patrol the Libyan coast, especially the waters off Tripoli; the Italian government wanted the fleet to bombard the forts of Tripoli, but Faravelli initially refrained from this, as he feared this would cause retaliation from the local Arab population against the Europeans living in the city, estimated to be about 2,000. Faravelli offered to take foreign citizens aboard his ships, but the consuls of the neutral countries stated that they felt protected enough by the Ottoman authorities, therefore only the Italian citizens, including many journalists that had rushed to Libya to follow the events as they unfolded (among them Luigi Barzini and Corrado Zoli), were taken aboard.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen did the Ottoman empire conquer Italy?\n\nI will provide you with contexts that may answer the question.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nHow many people live in Israel?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Russian language in Israel: The \"old immigrants\" of the 1970s, who mainly came to Israel for Zionist feelings, viewed people who came during the wave of the 1980s and 1990s as people escaping a harsh economic situation who did not have much appreciation for their new homeland. The last Soviet census of 1989 indicated 1,449,000 Jews living in the country, of which about 877,000 had moved to Israel by October 2000. The wave of immigration in this short period of time was the greatest influx of people to Israel since the date of its creation. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union composed 50%–70% of the newcomers. The number of people who came to Israel in the late 1980s and early 1990s outnumbered the number of people who came during the 1970s by four times, which made it harder for them to be integrated into the mainstream society of such a small country.\n\n[2] Israelis in the United Kingdom: In 2001 Israel was the 68th most common birthplace for British residents; some 11,892 people born in Israel lived in the UK. It is unknown how many people born in the UK are of Israeli descent, as this was not listed as a separate ethnic group in the 2001 Census. The majority of Israelis in the UK live in London and, in particular, the densely populated Jewish area of Golders Green. The vast majority of Israeli Britons are Jewish. The most common languages amongst the Israeli British community are Hebrew, Arabic and British English.\n\n[3] Israeli-occupied territories: About 300,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank along the Israeli West Bank barrier (and a further 200,000 live in East Jerusalem and 50,000 in the former Israeli–Jordanian no-man's land). The barrier has many effects on Palestinians including reduced freedoms, road closures, loss of land, increased difficulty in accessing medical and educational services in Israel, restricted access to water sources, and economic effects. Regarding the violation of freedom of Palestinians, in a 2005 report, the United Nations stated that:[47] ...it is difficult to overstate the humanitarian impact of the Barrier. The route inside the West Bank severs communities, people's access to services, livelihoods and religious and cultural amenities. In addition, plans for the Barrier's exact route and crossing points through it are often not fully revealed until days before construction commences. This has led to considerable anxiety among Palestinians about how their future lives will be impacted...The land between the Barrier and the Green Line constitutes some of the most fertile in the West Bank. It is currently the home for 49,400 West Bank Palestinians living in 38 villages and towns.\n\n[4] Human rights in Israel: Israel enacted an Equal Rights for People with Disabilities Law in 1998. Nevertheless, the US Department of State report on Israel stated that \"de facto discrimination against persons with disabilities\" exists in Israel. In 2014, there were approximately 1.6 million people with disabilities residing in Israel. Approximately 878,000 were between the ages of 20 to 64 and 488,000 were over the age of 64. A survey by the Dialog Institute showed that a significant portion of the Israeli population has difficulty accepting people with disabilities as neighbors, co-workers or classmates. 40% of those surveyed said they would \"be bothered\" if their children were in school with a disabled child, and almost a third of respondents said they would \"be bothered\" living in the same neighborhood as disabled people.\n\n[5] Jews: More than half of the Jews live in the Diaspora (see Population table). Currently, the largest Jewish community outside Israel, and either the largest or second-largest Jewish community in the world, is located in the United States, with 5.2 million to 6.4 million Jews by various estimates. Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada (315,000), Argentina (180,000–300,000), and Brazil (196,000–600,000), and smaller populations in Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Colombia and several other countries (see History of the Jews in Latin America). According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, about 470,000 people of Jewish heritage live in Latin-America and the Caribbean. Demographers disagree on whether the United States has a larger Jewish population than Israel, with many maintaining that Israel surpassed the United States in Jewish population during the 2000s, while others maintain that the United States still has the largest Jewish population in the world. Currently, a major national Jewish population survey is planned to ascertain whether or not Israel has overtaken the United States in Jewish population.\n\n[6] Demographics of Israel: The number of Vietnamese people in Israel and their descendants is estimated at 150 to 200. Most of them came to Israel in between 1976–1979, after prime minister Menachem Begin authorized their admission to Israel and granted them political asylum. The Vietnamese people living in Israel are Israeli citizens who also serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Today, the majority of the community lives in the Gush Dan area in the center of Tel Aviv, but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Haifa, Jerusalem, and Ofakim.\n\n[7] Israel: As of 2022, Israel's population was at an estimated people, of whom 74.5% were recorded by the civil government as Jews. Arabs comprised 20.9% of the population, while non-Arab Christians and people who have no religion listed in the civil registry made up 4.6%. Over the last decade, large numbers of migrant workers from Romania, Thailand, China, Africa, and South America have settled in Israel. Exact figures are unknown, as many of them are living in the country illegally, but estimates run in the region of 203,000. By June 2012, approximately 60,000 African migrants had entered Israel. About 92% of Israelis live in urban areas. Israel was established as a homeland for the Jewish people and is often referred to as a Jewish state. The country's Law of Return grants all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry the right to Israeli citizenship. Retention of Israel's population since 1948 is about even or greater, when compared to other countries with mass immigration. Jewish emigration from Israel (called \"yerida\" in Hebrew), primarily to the United States and Canada, is described by demographers as modest, but is often cited by Israeli government ministries as a major threat to Israel's future.\n\n[8] Standard of living in Israel: According to census, Israel's population is 75.4% Jewish, and 20.5% Arab, predominantly Palestinian, as well as Bedouins and Druze. About 4,000 Armenians and 4,000 Circassians live in Israel. There are smaller numbers of people of Jewish heritage or spouses of Jews, non-Arab Christians, and non-Arab Muslims. 3.7% of people are not classified by religion.\n\n[9] Standard of living in Israel: Israel is cited as having high social mobility due to the volume of Jewish immigrants in recent history. The current state of Israel shows fluid mobility among these Jewish immigrants. A possible reason for this ethnic difference in mobility is the relatively young age of the state of Israel and how it has changed economically and demographically through 21st century industrialization. Traditionally, there have been three endogenous demographics of Israel. These are Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Arabs. As the state of Israel was largely established as a home for Jewish people, immigrants of the religion rapidly migrated to Israel over the course of the 20th century. In terms of numbered population, there were 650,000 Jews in Israel in 1948; however, by 1964 there were over 2 million. There are multiple arguments to how this mobility through industrialization occurred. The \"liberal thesis of industrialization\" argues that industrialization will provide a higher rate of upward mobility over downward mobility as well as improved social equality. The view favored by marxists opposes the liberal thesis, arguing that while industrialization did create increased social mobility in Israel, it has lessened over time and only remained for select groups of people. Both of these views show that there has indeed been a history of high social mobility in Israel in comparison to other developed countries; however, the absolute distribution and application of this high rate to all citizens is likely not fully universal.\n\n[10] Israelis: The number of Vietnamese people in Israel is estimated at 200–400. Most of them came to Israel between 1976 and 1979, after the Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin granted them political asylum. The Vietnamese people living in Israel are Israeli citizens who also serve in the Israel Defense Forces. Today, the majority of the community lives in the Gush Dan area in the center of Israel but also a few dozen Vietnamese-Israelis or Israelis of Vietnamese origin live in Haifa, Jerusalem and Ofakim.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [7], and [10].\nNo answer is present in [2], [4], [6], [8], and [9].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Troops of the 8th Division, brought from north of the Bapaume–Albert road, to counter-attack from Thilloy towards Gueudecourt, were engaged by sixty British field guns, causing the German infantry to \"flee\" in the direction of Le Transloy. The British aircraft-artillery-tank-infantry attack on near Gueudecourt, led to many of the survivors of the 238th Reserve Regiment and a battalion of the 6th Bavarian Regiment being captured. The 50th Reserve Division was pushed further back towards Eaucourt l'Abbaye and Le Sars, as the 6th Bavarian Division took over the defence of the area; next day a Bavarian regiment was attacked, while being relieved by part of the 7th Reserve Division near and managed to hold its ground despite many casualties on both sides.\n\n[2] Battle of Morval: The Battle of Morval, 25–28 September 1916, was an attack during the Battle of the Somme by the British Fourth Army on the villages of Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesbœufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The main British attack was postponed, to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on the village of Combles south of Morval, to close up to the German defences between Moislains and Le Transloy, near the Péronne–Bapaume road (N 17). The combined attack from the Somme river northwards to Martinpuich on the Albert–Bapaume road, was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. The postponement was extended from because of rain, which affected operations more frequently during September.\n\n[3] Battle of the Somme: The Battle of Morval was an attack by the Fourth Army on Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesboeufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The attack was postponed to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on Combles, south of Morval and because of rain. The combined attack was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west, near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. Combles, Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt were captured and a small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon. Many casualties were inflicted on the Germans but the French made slower progress. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a salient near Combles. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge.\n\n[4] Battle of Morval: North of the 56th Division, the 95th Brigade of the 5th Division was delayed by enfilade machine-gun fire from the embankment north of the tram line and a strong point on the Ginchy–Morval road until bombed from the north. On the left the 15th Brigade followed the creeping barrage closely down into the valley, over-running and taking prisoner numerous Germans. The 95th Brigade resumed its advance up the far slope and rushed the German trench running south from Morval, as the 15th Brigade overran the trench further north, west of the village, taking many more prisoners. After another halt to reorganise, the village was occupied by the 15th Brigade at . The final objective from the windmill, south to the 56th Division area, was consolidated by nightfall. Several weak German counter-attacks were defeated and the 95th Brigade began working its way southward, towards the French at Frégicourt. The 6th Division attacked from north of Morval, to the road through the middle of Lesbœufs, on the left of the 5th Division. The first objective was taken by a battalion of the 16th Brigade on the right and two battalions of the 18th Brigade on the left. The final objective east of the Morval–Lesbœufs road was captured by two battalions leapfrogging through on the right and one on the left, to clear the south end of Lesbœufs, where the Guard Division was met as it occupied\n\n[5] Battle of Morval: A combined attack by the 2nd Division and the British 56th Division took Combles, before all of the German garrison escaped, after I Corps had been held up for most of the day, by German machine-gun fire south-east of the village. Patrols got into Combles overnight and by dawn on 26 September, the south-east of the town had been occupied and taken. German troops retreating east were \"routed\" in the direction of Haïe Wood by machine-gun fire. Much German equipment was captured, including two million rounds of ammunition, shells and many hand-grenades. I Corps then advanced a short distance east of the Fregicourt–Le Transloy road. A renewal of the attack towards the German defences between Haie Wood and St Pierre Vaast Wood, was delayed, until Mutton Trench on the left flank was attacked at by the British. The French attack managed to advance on the flanks but was held up in the centre.\n\n[6] Battle of Harlem Heights: The British casualties were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but a member of Howe's staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. The author David McCullough suggests much higher figures of \"probably...90 killed and about 300 wounded\" but cites no source for this. Henry Johnston, whose 1897 study remains the most thorough investigation of the battle, assessed British losses at 14 killed and 157 wounded and those of the Americans at about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Colonel Knowlton among the dead. Major Andrew Leitch, commander of the Virginia riflemen, died some days later. Both sides claimed victory. The repulse of British troops in this \"pretty sharp skirmish\" boosted morale in the American ranks 'prodigiously', as George Washington observed, even among those who had not been engaged. It also marked the first success of the war for the army directly under Washington's command.\n\n[7] Battle of Morval: An advance on the main front of the British attack of was to be made in stages. The first step was an advance to the third of the objective lines set for 15 September and to the Gird Trenches () south of Gueudecourt, beginning at The second objective was a line along the sunken road running from Combles to Gueudecourt, west of Morval and Lesbœufs, then over a spur south-east of Gueudecourt and through the centre of the village, beginning at The final objective was on the east side of Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, the advance to begin at with the objectives to be reached by\n\n[8] Battle of Morval: After the attacks of 12 and 15 September, Foch and Haig kept the Germans off balance, by mounting smaller operations. The British 6th Division captured the Quadrilateral north of Combles on 18 September. While the French Sixth and the Fourth Army prepared to resume larger attacks, the French Tenth Army to the south of the Somme captured Berny, Vermandovillers, Déniecourt and took several thousand prisoners. On the nights of 19 and 20 September, parties of the 56th Division consolidated a line west and north-east of Combles, from Beef Trench to Middle Copse. The new trench was dug north-east to a tram line near the junction of the Ginchy–Morval road, which connected Middle Copse with the Quadrilateral further north, creating a line long facing Bouleaux Wood. The division was ready to attack from Combles to Leuze Wood and Bouleaux Wood to envelop Bouleaux Wood and avoid a costly fight at close-quarters.\n\n[9] Battle of Morval: Anglo-French attacks had been expected on 23 September, rather than 25 September and the timing of the attack for the afternoon, also wrong-footed some of the defenders. The 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions of the XXVI Reserve Corps were quickly pushed back, part of the 236th Reserve Regiment being \"destroyed\" at the tram line north of Bouleaux Wood. Parts of the 235th Reserve Regiment west of Combles and the 234th Reserve Regiment in the village, were threatened with encirclement by the British from the north and the French in the south. A battalion of the 239th Reserve Regiment of the 52nd Reserve Division was cut off in Morval and part of the regiment was overwhelmed north of the village near Lesbœufs. The rest of Lesbœufs, held by the 240th Reserve Regiment from the same division fell easily. Parts of the 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions counter-attacked Morval but were only able to advance a short distance and cover the withdrawal of their artillery, eventually forming new a line along the Le Transloy road east of Morval.\n\n[10] Gloucestershire Regiment in World War I: On 3 September, during the Battle of Guillemont (3–6 September), 12th Battalion lost 328 men in an attack that succeeded in occupying the German second line from Wedge Wood to the southeastern edge of Guillemont. After the village was captured the battalion pushed on to Leuze Wood, nearly east of Guillemont, completing an advance of by 95th Brigade during the battle. The battalion was in action again during the Battle of Morval (25–28 September) when, along with 2nd Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers, it captured the southern half of Morval.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nHow many British troops died in the Battle of Morval?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

They took the language and feel of the blues producing the 'endless-solo'. \"Disraeli Gears\" took the blues and combined it with the drug-filled psychedelia, showing the artistic potential of rock.\n\n[2] Janet Billig Rich: Around 2003, Matt Weaver asked Billig Rich and a number of collaborators to help him develop and pitch the concept of a musical based on 1980s rock hits. Bands were to include Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, Foreigner, Pat Benatar, and Whitesnake. She became one of multiple producers for the show and took the role of talking to bands and securing song rights, a process which she has said took several years. \"Rock of Ages\" premiered in 2005. After playing off-Broadway in New York in fall 2008, it opened on Broadway on April 7, 2009. In 2009, the play received five Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical. Billig Rich is Executive Producer of the film version of \"Rock of Ages\", which was released in June 2012 and stars Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n\n[3] John Robb (musician): Robb has appeared as a pundit on various television programmes including BBC Breakfast, Channel 4's \"top 100\" shows, BBC's \"I Love the 60s/70s/80s/90s\" series and \"Seven Ages of Rock\". He has contributed to BBC 2's \"The Culture Show\" as well as several appearances on TV documentaries as well as on Channel 4 news talking about train travel, music piracy and the state of music, and on BBC radio commenting on pop culture. He has been a contributor to Sky's \"The Pop Years\" and co-produced and presented a ten-part series on the history of punk rock. He also presented a twelve-part guide to the arts in North West England. He is currently filming a series of interviews for Lush's Gorilla channel.\n\n[4] Seven Ages of Rock: It comprised six 60-minute episodes (reduced to 48 minutes for VH1 Classic), with a final episode of 90 minutes, and was broadcast on Saturdays at 21:00 (repeated on BBC One on Sundays). Each episode focused on one type of rock music, each typified by one or two artists or bands. The series producer was William Naylor, and the executive producer for the BBC was Michael Poole, a former editor of the 1990s BBC music, arts and culture programme \"The Late Show\". The production was based at BBC Bristol and each programme was narrated by Julian Rhind-Tutt on the BBC and Dennis Hopper on VH1 classic.\n\n[5] Rock Racing: Directed by Mariano Friedick, and comprising 21 riders with an average age of 29, Rock Racing had to \"come out of the gate swinging\" being the center of a controversy before the 2008 Amgen Tour of California when newly signed racers, Santiago Botero, Tyler Hamilton and Óscar Sevilla were not allowed to start due to the race organizers' policy banning convicted abusers of performance-enhancing drugs. Rock Racing's five remaining riders finished the seven-day race and scored seven top-10 finishes, including Cipollini's third in Sacramento on Stage 2. Ball had hired Mario Cipollini in early 2008 to race and replace Andreu as Director Sportif. On the eve of Milan-San Remo, which he won in 2002 only a few months before his first retirement, he announced he was going back into retirement.\n\n[6] Seven Ages of Rock: In 1962, The Rolling Stones formed and started playing in the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond. Their Blues with a British twist proved a hit with teenage audiences. The Rolling Stones began creating their own songs with lyrics loaded with arrogance and sex. Their space at the Crawdaddy club was taken by The Yardbirds, who attempted to produce their own twist on the blues, helped by their guitarist Eric Clapton, who was considered by some to be so proficient with the guitar that he garnered the popular nickname \"God\". However, he split from the Yardbirds after their commercial success to become a serious blues musician.\n\n[7] Seven Ages of Rock: By 1968, America and Europe were being torn apart by conflict at home and abroad. The Rolling Stones tapped into these feelings with a new creative zeal. However, their performance at Altamont became one of the most violent days in rock history, after a member of Hells Angels killed Meredith Hunter, a drugged member of the audience, who drew a revolver from his jacket during the Stones' set. The Altamont festival was meant to mirror the Woodstock Festival, where Hendrix delivered a searing version of the Star-Spangled Banner, which many saw as a political statement against the Vietnam War. However, Hendrix began to tire of stage performance and at the Isle of Wight festival in 1970 he gave a lacklustre performance. In September he died of an accidental overdose. Along with the deaths of Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin and the breaking up of The Beatles, this brought this age of rock to a close.\n\n[8] Seven Ages of Rock: Jimi Hendrix came to London in late 1966 after having been discovered and invited by his future manager Chas Chandler of The Animals, on the sole condition that he would be introduced to his guitar heroes. He arrived at the height of swinging London with Cream being the most important band around. At one of their concerts, Hendrix asked if he could join in a jam. That was already audacious, playing with 'God', but then he blew Clapton away, who went back stage and had a hard time lighting a cigarette because his hands were shaking too much. Stealing Cream's thunder, Chandler put together The Jimi Hendrix Experience, who became famous faster than almost any other rock band.\n\n[9] Seven Ages of Rock: A new wave of British bands were now emerging. The Kinks produced an electrified gritty sound expanding musical possibilities. Inspired by them, The Who combined a macho image, pop art and fast driven rock. In 1965, year zero of rock, the Who released a song that the program postulates defined the era, \"My Generation\", and was incredibly innovative in both its sound and rebellious message.\n\n[10] Seven Ages of Rock: The series did receive some criticism from the press as it ignored rock and roll's contribution to the birth of rock. Neil McCormick, music critic for \"The Daily Telegraph\" (who appeared in one of the episodes as an interviewee) said: \"...popular music only really gelled into what we now know as rock when Hendrix arrived in London in 1966.\"'.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" to the following questions:\n\n1.

The project also included converting of unused space and of maintenance property on the cemetery grounds into burial space in 2006 and 2007 to allow an additional 26,000 graves and 5,000 inurnments. The Millennium Project expanded the cemetery's physical boundaries for the first time since the 1960s, and was the largest expansion of burial space at the site since the American Civil War. Several environmental and historical preservation groups criticized Metzler's plans, as did the NPS and the manager of Arlington House.\n\n[2] Cypress Hills National Cemetery: Cypress Hills National Cemetery opened in 1862, the same year as Mill Springs National Cemetery in Kentucky, the oldest active national cemetery in the United States. Cypress Hills National Cemetery is two years older than Arlington National Cemetery.Located on the east slope of the Ridgewood Reservoir, the Union Grounds are in the southwest portion of Cypress Hills Cemetery, 833 Jamaica Avenue. There are more than 3,170 Union soldiers and sailors, and more than 461 captured or surrendered Confederates buried in the Union Grounds. Over the years the bowl-shaped space accepted veterans from other conflicts, up through World War I. Re-interments from other cemeteries added more graves. Most other interments, however, were largely local in nature, due to the cemetery's location in New York State (which contributed the largest numbers of fighting forces in the Civil War) and the adjacent proximity of the cemetery to New York City, the nation's most populous and hence the prime source of Federal enlistments for the war effort.\n\n[3] Arlington National Cemetery: Among the most frequently visited sites in the cemetery is the grave of President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who is buried nearby along with their son Patrick and their stillborn daughter Arabella. Kennedy's remains were interred there on March 14, 1967, a reinterment from his original Arlington burial site, some away, where he was buried in November 1963. The grave is marked with an \"eternal flame\". The remains of his brothers, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Senator Edward M. \"Ted\" Kennedy, are buried nearby. The latter two graves are marked with simple crosses and footstones. On December 1, 1971, Robert Kennedy's body was re-interred from its original June 1968 burial site.\n\n[4] Arlington National Cemetery mismanagement controversy: On June 16, 2010, \"The Washington Post\" notified the cemetery's new superintendent, Patrick K. Hallinan, that the newspaper's staff had found discarded headstones, most still bearing names, in a stream adjacent to Section 28 of the cemetery. Arlington officials are investigating and stated that they do not know why the headstones were there. U.S. Army officials said they would begin inspecting some graves using ground-penetrating radar.\n\n[5] Confederate Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery): The McKinley speech encouraged Dr. Samuel E. Lewis to seek additional improvements to the care and treatment of Confederate graves. Lewis, a former Confederate States Army (CSA) surgeon who then practiced medicine in Washington, D.C., was the leader (\"commander\") of the Charles Broadway Rouss Camp No. 1191 of the United Confederate Veterans (UCV), a veterans organization for those who fought for the Confederacy. Lewis had inventoried all Confederate graves at Arlington National Cemetery in early fall 1898 as part of the local group's historic documentation efforts. He discovered 136 identifiable Confederate graves, far more than the six or seven cemetery officials assumed existed. The graves were scattered all over the existing burial grounds, and the headstones were similar to those of civilian employees and African American \"contrabands\" (runaway slaves). The similarity to the headstones of black people especially angered Lewis. In early 1899, his group discovered another 189 graves in the Soldiers' Home National Cemetery in the District of Columbia.\n\n[6] Grave of Robert F. Kennedy: Arlington National Cemetery officials claimed in 2011 that Robert F. Kennedy's burial is the only one ever to have taken place at night in the cemetery. However, in 1963, there was another night burial in the cemetery. Shortly after John F. Kennedy's burial, his two infant children were buried next to him in Arlington at night. Senator Edward M. Kennedy's burial in 2009 also occurred at night.\n\n[7] William H. Johnson: Lincoln arranged for and paid for Johnson's burial in January 1864 and paid for his headstone. Burial records from the time were not well kept and at least three competing locations have been proposed for Johnson's grave. The most popular is a William H. Johnson who was buried in 1864 at Arlington National Cemetery, although his common surname makes a conclusive match impossible. Contrary to a popular myth though, Lincoln did not purchase the headstone that appears there now. Arlington ordered a new stone and inscribed on it \"Citizen,\" which was the label used to distinguish civilian graves from soldiers before Arlington became an exclusively military cemetery.\n\n[8] Confederate Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery): At in height, the Confederate Memorial is among the tallest of the memorials and monuments at Arlington National Cemetery. It is often claimed to be the tallest, but this is incorrect as the obelisk over the grave of Major General Joseph Wheeler is taller ().\n\n[9] James Parks: The first graves in Arlington National Cemetery were dug by James Parks, a former Arlington Estate slave. Parks was freed in 1862 under the terms of the will of his former owner, George Washington Parke Custis. He still lived on Arlington Estate when Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton signed the orders designating Arlington as a military burial ground. Parks served in the U.S. Army from 1861 to 1929 by working as a grave digger and maintenance man for the cemetery.\n\n[10] Arlington National Cemetery mismanagement controversy: In September 2012, the US Army's Inspector General issued a report on Arlington cemetery and the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery which found that the Army's new management of the institutions had transformed both, \"into premier institutions of excellence capable of setting the standards for federal cemeteries across the nation.\" The report stated that 96% of the 400,000 grave markers at Arlington had been verified for accuracy as of 17 September 2012. The report lauded a program at Arlington, implemented by new director Patrick Hallinan, which used geospatial technology to track cemetery operations. In response to the report, Senator Mark Warner stated, \"Condon and her team deserve a lot of credit for implementing reforms to fix the problems at Arlington and begin restoring our trust.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nThe oldest grave at Arlington National Cemetery is the grave of William H.

Terrence Howard will portray Lucious Lyon, a former drug dealer turned hip hop mogul and the CEO of Empire Entertainment who now is imprisoned. Taraji P. Henson will play Cookie Lyon, Lucious' outspoken ex-wife and mother of his three sons, who served 17 years in prison, and have now made a hostile takeover for Empire Entertainment with Anika, Andre and Hakeem. Lucious and Cookie have three sons: Andre Lyon, the eldest son of the Lyon family and CFO of Empire Entertainment who will be played by Trai Byers, and will deal with his wife killing Uncle Vernon in the previous season finale. Jussie Smollett will play Jamal Lyon, the middle son and \"black sheep\" of the Lyon family, a talented, gay singer-songwriter who has been given control over Empire from his father, Lucious. Bryshere Y. Gray will portray Hakeem Lyon, the fame-obsessed youngest son and Lucious' favorite child, who is a hip hop star on the rise and has been included in the hostile takeover with his mother, Anika and Andre.\n\n[2] Empire (2015 TV series): In Canada, the series was simulcast on Omni Television (Omni 2). The fourth episode and the season finale would also air on City, a sibling broadcast network. Sibling cable network FX Canada would also air a marathon of the show on March 14 and 15, 2015. The show moved to City starting in the 2015–16 season, but was dropped from their lineup after the first half of the second season due to low ratings; Fox affiliates are widely available on pay television as well as over-the-air in some areas. Shomi, a subscription streaming service co-owned by City's parent company Rogers Communications, began to add new episodes following their U.S. premiere on Fox. A representative of the service stated that \"Empire\" was among its ten most popular programs.\n\n[3] Empire: Original Soundtrack from Season 1: Empire: Original Soundtrack from Season 1 is the debut soundtrack album by the cast of the musical drama television series \"Empire\", which airs on Fox. The album includes songs that featured during the first season of the show, and performed by various artists. The album was released by Columbia Records. The soundtrack received positive critical reception and debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in the United States. On September 11, 2015, another soundtrack titled \"Empire: The Complete Season 1\" was released containing every song heard on the show that weren't included on the official soundtrack.\n\n[4] Boardwalk Empire (season 1): Terence Winter, who had served as executive producer and writer on the HBO series \"The Sopranos\", was hired to adapt the novel \"Boardwalk Empire\" on June 4, 2008. Winter had been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. It was for this reason that he decided to focus his adaption of the novel on the Prohibition era section. On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot. It would be the first time he had directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's \"Amazing Stories\" in 1986. The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. \"I kept thinking 'This is pointless. How can we possibly afford a boardwalk, or an empire? says creator Terence Winter. \"We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk.\" The production would eventually build a boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York at the cost of five million dollars. Despite a reported budget of up to $50 million, the pilot's final budget came in at $18 million.\n\n[5] Empire (season 2): The show centers on a hip hop music and entertainment company, Empire Entertainment, and the drama among the members of the founders' family as they fight for control of the company.\"Empire\" was renewed for a second season on January 17, 2015, by Fox after only two episodes had aired. It was announced to contain 18 episodes, split into two parts, with ten episodes in the fall, and the remaining eight episodes after the Christmas break, beginning in January. Filming began on June 23, 2015, as confirmed by Fox, in addition to Chris Rock being spotted on set.\n\n[6] Empire Air Day: Empire Air Day was an annual air show open to the public held at Royal Air Force stations in the United Kingdom in the 1930s. According to a speech on by Anthony Muirhead in the House of Commons recorded in \"Hansard\", \"The idea of Empire Air Day is that the public should be enabled to see the Royal Air Force at its everyday work. As many stations as possible... are opened to the public on payment of a small charge for admission. At each station a programme of flying is arranged.\" The first Empire Air Day was held on 24 May 1934. The last Empire Air Day was held on 20 May 1939.\n\n[7] How Clean Is Your House?: The format has been adapted to many other countries. A United States version, starring Kim and Aggie, premiered in September 2004 on the Lifetime network and ran for two seasons. This edition also aired in the UK on Channel 4. This version has been criticized for using product placement such as Mr Clean and Bounty instead of the homemade cleaning solutions that the UK version uses. Both the UK & US versions aired in Canada on the W Network and in Australia on cable television channel UK.TV.\n\n[8] Empire (2015 TV series): \"Empire\" started broadcasting in the UK on E4 with the first episode airing on April 28, 2015. 5Star have since taken over the rights as of Season 4. The series premiered in India on STAR World Premiere HD on April 24, 2015 (only in high-definition).

In Serbia series start January 23, 2016 on Fox it aired Thursdays at 10pm.\n\n[9] Empire (season 4): The fourth season of the American television drama series \"Empire\" premiered on September 27, 2017, in the United States on Fox. The fourth season was ordered on January 11, 2017, consisting of eighteen episodes. The show is produced by 20th Century Fox Television, in association with Imagine Entertainment, Lee Daniels Entertainment, Danny Strong Productions and Little Chicken Inc. The showrunners for this season are Ilene Chaiken, Danny Strong and Lee Daniels. The season airs on Wednesday at 8:00 pm, a new slot. The premiere of the season had also a crossover with other Lee Daniels-created Fox series \"Star\". The season concluded on May 23, 2018.\n\n[10] Empire (2015 TV series): The show's premiere ranked as Fox's highest-rated debut in three years. Viewership has increased continuously; \"Empire\" is the first primetime broadcast series in at least 23 years to have its viewership increase week to week for its first five episodes. The show continues to increase its viewership with further episodes. Episodes of the show have also been heavily watched on Video on Demand and other streaming services. As of its first season finale, \"Empire\" has now surpassed \"The Big Bang Theory\" as the highest rated scripted program in the 2014–2015 television season. The first season finale is also the highest rated debut season finale since May 2005, when \"Grey's Anatomy\" ended its first season. \"Empire's\" season one finale grew 82 percent from its series premiere, making it the show that has grown the most over the course of its first season since \"Men in Trees\" during the 2006–2007 season.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease select one of the following options based on the information provided:\n\nYes, answer is present\nI don't know\n\nPlease select one of the following options based on the information provided:\n\nYes, answer is present\n", "llama-2-7b-chat": "How many seasons of Empire have been on the air?\n\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if you have found the information you were looking for, or \"I don't know\" if you cannot find the answer.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

The two person crew stayed were in space for a record setting 96 days, from December 1977 to March 1978. The expedition was the start of what would be the semi-permanent occupation of space by the Soviets.\n\n[2] Eos: Eos was the daughter of the Titans Hyperion, a bringer of light, the \"One Above, Who Travels High Above the Earth\" and of Theia, \"The Divine,\" also called Euryphaessa, \"wide-shining\" and Aethra, \"bright sky\". She was the sister of Helios, god of the sun and Selene, goddess of the moon, \"\"who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven\"\". The generation of Titans preceded all the familiar deities of Olympus who largely supplanted them. In some accounts, Eos' father was called Pallas.\n\n[3] Axis occupation of Greece: The occupation of Greece was divided among Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. German forces occupied the most strategically important areas, namely Athens, Thessaloniki with Central Macedonia and several Aegean Islands, including most of Crete. Initially, the German zone was ruled by the ambassador Günther Altenburg of the German Foreign Office and Field Marshal Wilhelm List. From 1942 onwards, the German occupation zone was ruled by the duumvirate of the plenipotentiary for South-Eastern Europe, Hermann Neubacher, and Field Marshal Alexander Löhr. In September–October 1943, Jürgen Stroop, the newly appointed Higher SS Police Leader, tried to challenge the Neubacher-Löhr duumvirate and was swiftly fired after less than a month on the job. Walter Schimana replaced Stroop as the Higher SS Police Leader in Greece and was able to establish a better working relationship with the Neubacher-Löhr duumvirate.\n\n[4] Korean pronouns: In colloquial Korean, interrogative \"mu-eos\" (무엇) contracts to \"mwo\" (뭐, \"what\") (often pronounced \"meo\", as \"w\" tends to drop after \"m\"), and the accusative \"mu-eos-eul\" (무엇을) contracts to \"mwol\" (뭘, \"what\"). In literature, another set of contraction for mu-eos is available for senior or archaic speakers: \"mu-eo\" (무어) for mu-eos, \"mu-e\" (무에) for mu-eos-i, \"mu-eol\" (무얼) for mu-eos-eul. In addition is \"mwos\" (뭣), seldom used.\n\n[5] Arthur Evans: Evans was arrested in 1882, to be put on trial as a British agent provocateur stirring up further insurrection. His journalistic sources were not acceptable friendships to the authorities. He spent six weeks in prison awaiting trial, but at the trial nothing definitive could be proved. His wife was interrogated. She found most offensive the reading of her love letters before her eyes by a hostile police agent. Evans was expelled from the country. Gladstone had been apprised of the situation immediately, but, as far as the public knew, did nothing. The government in Vienna similarly disavowed any knowledge of or connection to the actions of the local authorities. The Evans's returned home to rent a house in Oxford, abandoning their villa, which was turned into a hotel. However, Evans's reputation among the Slavs assumed unassailable proportions. He was invited later to play a role in the formation of the pre-Yugoslav state. In 1941 the government of Yugoslavia sent representatives to his funeral.\n\n[6] Clough Williams-Ellis: In 1908 he inherited a small country house, Plas Brondanw, from his father, restoring and embellishing it over the rest of his life, and rebuilding it after a fire in 1951. He served with distinction in the First World War, serving first with the Royal Fusiliers and then the Welsh Guards, with whom he was awarded the Military Cross. Postwar he helped John St Loe Strachey (who became his father in law) revive pisé construction in Britain, building an apple storehouse followed by Harrowhill Copse bungalow at Newlands Corner (photos) using shuttering and rammed earth. During the 1920s, he began work on Portmeirion, later the location for \"The Prisoner\" (1967–68) TV series.\n\n[7] Europeans in Medieval China: At the very least, archaeological evidence supports the claim in the \"Weilüe\" and \"Book of Liang\" that Roman merchants were active in Southeast Asia, if not the claim of their embassies arriving in China through Jiaozhi, the Chinese-controlled province of northern Vietnam. Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius have been found in Oc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City), a territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Funan bordering Jiaozhi. Suggestive of even earlier activity is a Republican-era Roman glass bowl unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou (on the shores of the South China Sea) dated to the early 1st century BC, in addition to ancient Mediterranean goods found in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy wrote in his Antonine-era \"Geography\" that beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) was a port city called Kattigara discovered by a Greek sailor named Alexander, a site Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed was Chinese-controlled Hanoi, but given the archaeological evidence could have been Oc Eo. Roman coins have been found in China, but far fewer than in India.\n\n[8] University of Minnesota Solar Vehicle Project: \"Eos I\" continues the team's focus on more practical multi-occupant solar cars. It differs from Daedalus in that the occupants are on either side of the catamaran shell with door on the sides instead of a canopy on top. \"Eos\" finished BWSC 2015 without trailering despite a more challenging scoring formula and regulations. In 2016, \"Eos I\" became the first Cruiser car to ever compete in the American Solar Challenge.\n\n[9] Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd): In March 1848 he moved to Cardiff to edit \"The Principality\", a weekly English-language newspaper which had been established the previous year by David Tudor Evans. Jones left the paper in September after falling out with the publisher. A month later he was working on John Cassell's \"Standard of Freedom\" in London, followed by an editorial role on \"The Pathway\" before editing \"Almanac y Cymru\" in 1849. Before ill health forced him to return to Cardiff he remarried, to Rachel, daughter of Reverend Walter Lewis of Tredustan. In 1850 Jones was the first editor of \"Y Gymraes\" (\"The Welshwomen\") under the patronage of Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover. \"Y Gymraes\", which first appeared in January of that year. It was published as a direct response to the debate caused by an 1847 governmental bill into the state of education in Wales. The report were immensely detailed and was damning towards not only the state of education in Wales but drew a very critical picture of the Welsh as a people. Jones was a constant champion towards his people, specially the womenfolk, whose morals were severely criticized in the report. He set out to prove that the morality of the Welsh were no different to the English to which the Bill compared them, making detailed studies of facts such as the comparison of the countries' illegitimacy rates. Although he privately disapproved of some practices conducted in\n\n[10] Greeks in the United Kingdom: That set the pattern for Greek settlement over the next two hundred years. Some came as soldiers during the reign of Henry VIII, led by the officers Theodore Luchisi, Antonios Stesinos, and Colonel Thomas of Argos (or Thomas Buas), responsible for the garrisoning of the then-English possession of Calais. Some came as visitors for a short period. In about 1545, of Corfu spent time in London and left an interesting account of his impressions. Indeed, he followed as a non-combatant an English invasion of Scotland where the English forces included Greeks from Argos under the leadership of Thomas of Argos whose 'Courage, and prudence, and experience of wars' was lauded by the Corfiot traveller. Thomas was sent by Henry VIII to Boulogne in 1546, as commander of a battalion of 550 Greeks\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following questions:\n\n1.

Georgia\" held that arbitrary imposition of the death penalty at the states' discretion constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This was preceded with the Supreme Court of California's ruling in \"California v. Anderson\" 64 Cal.2d 633, 414 P.2d 366 (Cal. 1972), which classified capital punishment as cruel and unusual and outlawed the use of capital punishment in California (however, this was reversed the same year through a ballot initiative, Proposition 17). It was reinstated nationally in 1976 after the US Supreme Court rulings Gregg v. Georgia, , \"Jurek v. Texas\", , and Proffitt v. Florida, . As of January 25, 2008, the death penalty has been abolished in the District of Columbia and fourteen states, mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.\n\n[2] Capital punishment in Georgia (U.S. state): The first execution in Georgia was in 1735. The offender was indentured servant Alice Wyley, who had murdered her master. From 1735 to 1924, the method of execution was hanging. The last hanging occurred in 1931. Between 1735 and 1931, over 500 hangings occurred in Georgia. In August, 1924, the Georgia General Assembly outlawed hanging and introduced electrocution instead. Georgia then used this method until 1972, when \"Furman v. Georgia\" declared the capital punishment procedures unconstitutional. Electrocution was re-instated, along with the death penalty, in 1976 as a result of \"Gregg v. Georgia\". In 2000, the General Assembly passed a new law instituting lethal injection instead of electrocution.\n\n[3] Capital punishment in Washington (state): On October 11, 2018, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled the current death penalty statute unconstitutional, on the ground that it resulted in racial bias, thus abolishing capital punishment in the state. It became the 20th state in the nation to outlaw executions. The eight inmates that were on death row at the time of ruling had their sentences converted to life in prison. The State Supreme Court did not rule out the possibility that the state legislature could enact a constitutional death penalty statute in the future.\n\n[4] Capital punishment: Abolition was often adopted due to political change, as when countries shifted from authoritarianism to democracy, or when it became an entry condition for the European Union. The United States is a notable exception: some states have had bans on capital punishment for decades, the earliest being Michigan where it was abolished in 1846, while other states still actively use it today. The death penalty in the United States remains a contentious issue which is hotly debated.\n\n[5] Capital punishment in Oklahoma: On December 16, 2010, Oklahoma became the first American state to use pentobarbital, in the execution of John David Duty. In 2014, Oklahoma placed scheduled executions on hold until the state's Department of Corrections implemented eleven proposed improvements in protocols governing capital punishment. The review of the lethal injection administration process resulted from the protracted 33 minute execution of Clayton Darrell Lockett in which a doctor and a paramedic failed nearly a dozen times to administer an IV with lethal drugs. Executions resumed on January 15, 2015 with the execution of Charles Frederick Warner by lethal injection; Warner is the last man to be executed in Oklahoma to date.\n\n[6] School corporal punishment in the United States: The first state to abolish school corporal punishment was New Jersey in 1867. In 1894, a Newark bill challenged this ruling, arguing that whipping should be legal if parents consented to it; the New Jersey House defeated that bill, with one doctor's testimonial asserting that the bill's provisions \"would expose children who did not have thoughtful and careful parents to the cruel discrimination of the teachers.\" The second state to ban corporal punishment in schools was Massachusetts, 104 years later in 1971. As of 2015, corporal punishment is banned in state schools (known as \"public schools\" in the U.S.) in 31 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (see list below). The usage of corporal punishment in private schools is legally permitted in nearly every state, though extremely uncommon in most, with only New Jersey and Iowa prohibiting it in both public and private schools. Corporal punishment is still used in schools to a significant (though declining) extent in some public schools in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, North Carolina and Texas. The most recent state to outlaw school corporal punishment was New Mexico in 2011.\n\n[7] Capital punishment in the United States: Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States, currently used by 30 states, the federal government, and the military. Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies. The United States is the only Western country currently applying the death penalty. It is one of 54 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries. The Philippines has since abolished executions, and Guatemala has done so for civil offenses, leaving the USA one of 4 countries to use this method, along with China, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n\n[8] Capital punishment in Oregon: Since 1904, about 60 Five Cayuse Native American men were taken to Oregon City, tried and sentenced to hang. Before their execution on June 3, 1850, the leader, Tiloukaikt, accepted Catholic last rites. Tiloukaikt spoke on the gallows, \"Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So we die to save our people.\" Capital punishment was made explicitly legal by statute in 1864, and executions have been carried out exclusively at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem since 1904. The death penalty was outlawed between 1914 and 1920, again between 1964 and 1978, and then again between a 1981 Oregon Supreme Court ruling and a 1984 ballot measure.\n\n[9] Capital punishment in Michigan: Although Michigan had outlawed the death penalty after becoming a state, the United States Government hanged Anthony Chebatoris at the Federal Correctional Institution, Milan near Milan, Michigan in 1938, for a murder he had committed while robbing a federal bank in Midland.\n\n[10] Social policy of the Barack Obama administration: On June 25, 2008, Obama condemned United States Supreme Court decision \"Kennedy v. Louisiana\", which outlawed the death penalty for a child rapist when the victim was not killed. He said that states have the right to consider capital punishment, but cited concern about the possibility of unfairness in some sentences.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Launched on January 25, 1994, the objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the Moon and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 Geographos. The Geographos observations were not made due to a malfunction in the spacecraft.\n\n[2] Ariane flight VA241: An independent investigation board was established in collaboration with the European Space Agency and National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under the chairmanship of ESA's inspector general to investigate what caused the trajectory deviation during flight. The conclusions of the investigation commission led by ESA's inspector general, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, were released on 22 February 2018, indicating that engineers left the inertial navigation units' azimuth value at 90° (the standard for GTO launch on Ariane 5), however unusually 70° was intended for these payloads riding into unusual SSTO, explaining the cause of the 17° trajectory deviation. Standard verification procedure missed the azimuth data. The reason of launching both satellites to SSTO was Al Yah 3 satellite manufacturer (Orbital ATK) abruptly requested Arianespace to change the target orbit profile to SSTO in order to release the Al Yah 3 satellite at a right angle relative to the direction of motion of the rocket.\n\n[3] CASSIOPE: CASSIOPE, or \"CAS\"cade, \"S\"mallsat and \"IO\"nospheric \"P\"olar \"E\"xplorer, is a Canadian Space Agency (CSA) multi-mission satellite operated by MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA). The mission is funded through CSA and the Technology Partnerships Canada program. It was launched September 29, 2013, on the first flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle. CASSIOPE is the first Canadian hybrid satellite to carry a dual mission in the fields of telecommunications and scientific research. The main objectives are to gather information to better understand the science of space weather, while verifying high-speed communications concepts through the use of advanced space technologies.\n\n[4] SPOT (satellite): SPOT (, lit. \"Satellite for observation of Earth\") is a commercial high-resolution optical imaging Earth observation satellite system operating from space. It is run by Spot Image, based in Toulouse, France. It was initiated by the CNES (\"Centre national d'études spatiales\" – the French space agency) in the 1970s and was developed in association with the SSTC (Belgian scientific, technical and cultural services) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). It has been designed to improve the knowledge and management of the Earth by exploring the Earth's resources, detecting and forecasting phenomena involving climatology and oceanography, and monitoring human activities and natural phenomena. The SPOT system includes a series of satellites and ground control resources for satellite control and programming, image production, and distribution. Earlier satellites were launched using the European Space Agency's Ariane 2, 3, and 4 rockets, while SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 were launched by the Indian PSLV.\n\n[5] United Arab Emirates Space Agency: The UAE proposed in 2008 to establish a Pan-Arab Space Agency, as a civilian project like the European Space Agency (ESA). The Arab Science and Technology Foundation said an agency for the Middle East and North Africa already had unofficial support from some governments and hoped that a regional organisation for disseminating satellite images could form an early foundation. The agency would monitor security and environmental changes with equatorial satellites. It would not develop its own launch capability, as that was commercially available. The proposed regional agency would reduce the cost of putting satellites into orbit and pool talent and research. Plans were submitted to the region's governments and pushed for at the Global Space Technology Forum in December 2009. The UAE had already launched satellites and established an Earth Observation Space Center in Abu Dhabi. However, little progress to establish the regional agency was made after the proposal.\n\n[6] Soviet space program: The Soviet space program had withheld information on its projects predating the success of Sputnik, the world's first artificial satellite. In fact, when the Sputnik project was first approved, one of the most immediate courses of action the Politburo took was to consider what to announce to the world regarding their event. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) established precedents for all official announcements on the Soviet space program. The information eventually released did not offer details on who built and launched the satellite or why it was launched. However, the public release is illuminating in what it does reveal : \"there is an abundance of arcane scientific and technical data...as if to overwhelm the reader with mathematics in the absence of even a picture of the object\". What remains of the release is the pride for Soviet cosmonautics and the vague hinting of future possibilities then available after Sputnik's success.\n\n[7] Israel Space Agency: The Sloshsat-FLEVO was a satellite launched for the study of liquid sloshing phenomena in space. The satellite was developed in collaboration between the Dutch NLR labs, Fokker Space, and Rafael. The satellite is helped by the Israel Space Agency and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Israel Space Agency initiated the project and partly funded it by supplying the sub-propulsion system.\n\n[8] Small Satellite Program (United States Naval Academy): The satellite development process is a multi-semester effort requiring the contributions of Midshipmen from two distinct groups: 1) Senior Capstone Design Team involving several consecutive graduating classes and 2) Extra Curricular Activity open to all four classes and any majors program. In the senior capstone class, First Class Midshipmen studying aerospace engineering/astronautical track, take a Spacecraft Design and initiate the satellite building process in the fall semester with the identification of the mission and determination of requirements followed by development of the conceptual design. In the spring semester the graduating midshipmen will conduct assembly, testing, and final preparations of the satellite for launch. An extra curricular group consisting of all classes and open to all majors also contribute to SSP and is designed to further develop midshipmen interaction with space rated projects. The group often aids and assists the senior capstone team, however they design, build, construct and test their own platforms.\n\n[9] CASSIOPE: The satellite that became CASSIOPE began with a 1996 concept for a small (), inexpensive microsatellite called \"Polar Outflow Probe\", or POP. The Canadian Space Agency funded a 1997 feasibility study that led to a modified mission concept that was designed during 2000-2005. The revised concept was to combine an enhanced version of POP, called e-POP, with an MDA Corporation commercial satellite called \"Cascade\", into a single satellite, and to design and build a generic, low-cost small satellite bus that would be useful for other Canadian satellite missions in the future.\n\n[10] China Academy of Space Technology: The China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) () is a Chinese space agency and subordinate of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The agency was founded on 20 February 1968 and is the main spacecraft development and production facility in China. On 24 April 1970 CAST successfully launched China's first artificial satellite Dong Fang Hong I.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat space agency launched the 'CAPSTONE' satellite?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.

M. Miller: Miller's tenure in the Senate, at a mere seven days long, ranks (as of 2017) as the second-shortest in American history. The shortest Senate tenure belongs to Sen. Louis C. Wyman from New Hampshire, who served for only three days from his appointment on December 31, 1974, to the end of his term on January 3, 1975. (The second tenure of Sen. Salmon P. Chase from Ohio is shorter, lasting two days from the beginning of his term on March 4, 1861, to his resignation on March 6, 1861; however, Chase had previously already served a full term from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1855, so he is not the shortest-serving senator.)

The uprising was not centrally coordinated; rather, it was attempted by multiple factions – among them Sunni, Druze, Alawite, Christian, and Shia – with the common goal of ending French rule. The revolt was ultimately put down by French forces.\n\n[2] Irish and German Mercenary Soldiers' revolt: Unrest among both the Irish and the German mercenaries due to rough treatment, non-payment of wages, general misery, and rumors of going into battle soon, grew. The similarly recruited (and deceived) German mercenary soldiers started the Great Mercenary Revolt on 9 June 1828. When one of their number was sentenced to fifty lashes for a minor infraction, which was quintupled to 250, after 210 lashes the Germans freed their comrade, and attacked the hated officer, who fled for his life. Word of the German revolt quickly reached the Irish, and about 200 Irish joined. Weapons and liquor were seized. Irish sources state that the homes of a few hated officers were looted and burned by marauding bands. Brazilian sources record that whole blocks of downtown Rio de Janeiro were razed.\n\n[3] Great Fear: Peasant revolt was clearly not a phenomenon new to late eighteenth-century France: the fourteenth century saw the Jacquerie in the Oise Valley, and the seventeenth century saw the Croquant rebellions. Yves-Marie Bercé, in History of the Peasant Revolts, concludes \"peasant revolts of the years 1789–92 had much in common with their seventeenth-century counterparts: unanimity of the rural community, rejection of new taxation to which they were unaccustomed, defiance of enemy townsmen and a belief that there would be a general remission in taxes, particularly when the king decided to convene the estates general. In spite of all that is suggested by the political history of the period, the peasant disturbances at the beginning of the French Revolution did not depart from the typical community revolt of the preceding century.\"\n\n[4] Winfield Toll Bridge: Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n\n[5] Indian Rebellion of 1857: The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 miles northeast of Delhi (now Old Delhi). It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities formally to have ended until 8 July 1859. The rebellion is known by many names, including the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and in South Asia as the First War of Independence.\n\n[6] Great Fear: Comparing the peasant revolts of the Tard Avisés with the Great Fear of 1789 reveals some key similarities and differences. From 1593–1595, in Limousin and Périgord, groups of peasants rose up against the armed forces that occupied the countryside and raised funds by levying taxes and ransom. In a series of assemblies, the Croquants, as they were pejoratively called, worked on a military plan for action and successfully expelled the garrisons from their lands. The letters between these assemblies justified their armed resistance as opposition to unjust claims on their property. When the chaotic political situation was stabilized with the coronation of Henry IV, the revolts ended and the peasants were eventually accorded the tax rebate they had demanded earlier. The Tard-Avisés had specific goals and achieved them; the same cannot be said of the participants in the Great Fear.\n\n[7] Peasants' Revolt: The Peasants' Revolt, also named Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, was a major uprising across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, an end to the system of unfree labour known as serfdom, and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.\n\n[8] Syria-Cilicia commemorative medal: An uneasy peace ensued which was broken on 23 August 1925 when Sultan Pasha al-Atrash declared revolution against France, thus starting the Great Syrian Revolt (also called the Great Druze Revolt), which took several years for the French Government to subdue.\n\n[9] Arab Revolt: The Arab Revolt (, ; ) or Great Arab Revolt (, ) was officially initiated by Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, at Mecca on June 10, 1916 (9 Sha'ban of the Islamic calendar for that year) although his sons ‘Ali and Faisal had already initiated operations at Medina starting on 5 June with the aim of securing independence from the ruling Ottoman Turks and creating a single unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo in Syria to Aden in Yemen.\n\n[10] Great Saxon Revolt: The Great Saxon Revolt was a civil war between 1077 and 1088 early in the history of the Holy Roman Empire led by a group of opportunistic German princes who elected as their figurehead the duke of Swabia and anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfeld, a two-way brother-in-law of the young Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor (Henry was crowned at the age of six and took on his offices when aged sixteen). It followed the Saxon Rebellion of 1073–75.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Ridgebacks are typically muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat, which should be short, dense, sleek and glossy in appearance, and neither woolly nor silky.\n\n[2] Rhodesian Ridgeback: Degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a neurological disease of the spinal cord causing progressive paraparesis, most commonly in the German shepherd dog breed. It affects Rhodesian Ridgebacks at a rate of only 0.75%. Signs of degenerative myelopathy are characterised at the beginning with foot dragging, and slipping of the rear limbs. The disease progresses to the point where the animal can no longer stand or walk on its own. Progression has been known to take as little as six months, or several years. There is a DNA test offered by the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals, to test for the gene. Animals who are at risk for the disease should not be bred to other animals at risk, as this creates future generations of this debilitating disease.\n\n[3] Rhodesian Ridgeback: Health conditions that are known to affect this breed are hip dysplasia and dermoid sinus. The ridgeback ranks number six in terms of most affected breeds for thyroid problems recorded by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. In 2014, the UK breed survey reported an average lifespan of 11 years.\n\n[4] Rhodesian Ridgeback: The Khoikhoi people who lived in the Cape Peninsula when the Dutch began trading with the area during the mid 17th century, had a hunting dog which was described as ugly, but noted for its ferocity when acting as a guard dog. This dog measured approximately at the withers, with a lean but muscular frame. The ears have been described both as erect and hanging, but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair often growing in the reverse direction along its back. Within 53 years of Dutch colonisation in Southern Africa and the origins of the wagon-trekking \"boers\" later known as Afrikaners, who converted vast stretches of wild veld into farmland, hunted for meat and defended their cattle herds, staff, and homesteads from lion, the Europeans were using these local dogs themselves.\n\n[5] Rhodesian girdled lizard: The Rhodesian girdled lizard (\"Cordylus rhodesianus\") is one of three species of very flattened girdled lizards from Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Mozambique. The other two species are \"Cordylus nyikae\" and \"Cordylus meculae\". They are found living under stones in rock outcrops where they feed on small arthropods. Adults are 60-90 mm long from snout to vent. The tail length is approximately half the total length.\n\n[6] Rhodesian Ridgeback: The Rhodesian Ridgeback's distinguishing feature is the ridge of hair running along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of its coat. It consists of a fan-like area formed by two whorls of hair (called \"crowns\") and tapers from immediately behind the shoulders down to the level of the hips. The ridge is usually about in width at its widest point. It is believed to originate from the dog used by the original African dog population which had a similar ridge. The first depiction of a ridgeback is a wall painting describing the life of the Boers, housed in South Africa in the Voortrekker Monument.\n\n[7] Rhodesian Ridgeback: Dermoid sinus is a congenital neural-tube defect that is known to affect this breed. The dermoid is often likened to a thin \"spaghetti strand\" beneath the skin. Puppies should always be screened at birth by the breeder and veterinarian, and the examination repeated as the puppies grow before they go to their new homes. This is done by palpation of the subcutaneous dorsal midline from the base of the skull to the insertion of the tail. Surgical removal is an option for affected neonates, puppies and adult dogs. All affected dogs, even those surgically corrected, should be spayed or neutered and never be bred, since surgical dermoid sinus removal can be extremely cost prohibitive, and because many unremoved dermoid sinuses will eventually abscess. Abscessed dermoid sinuses will be at best a recurrent, painful problem, and if the sinus communicates with the tissues around the spinal cord, cause meningitis and often death. However, it has been shown that supplementation of folic acid to the diet of the brood bitch before mating and during pregnancy reduces the incidence of dermoid sinus. One study on the Swedish population estimates that 8-10% are affected. Slightly less than 5% of ridgebacks were reported to be affected with the condition in a US breed club survey.\n\n[8] Rhodesian Ridgeback: Hypothyroidism is a growing problem in the Rhodesian Ridgeback, and this condition causes a multitude of symptoms, including weight gain and hair loss. Treatment for hypothyroidism in dogs consists of an inexpensive once-daily oral medication. Dr. Lorna Kennedy at the University of Manchester’s Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in England has found the haplotype (group of genes), which, when present, double the chances of a Ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to lymphocytic thyroiditis. This is important to the breed because lymphocytic thyroiditis is the overwhelming cause of hypothyroidism in ridgebacks.\n\n[9] Rhodesian Ridgeback: One possible reason for these studies to deviate from the expected 25% incidence of ridgelessness is inclusion of parents who were not heterozygous (possessing a copy of both the ridgeless and ridged allele) in the study. The inclusion of homozygotes (possessing two copies of the ridged alleles) would make the observed incidence be less than 25% when averaged across the population in the study. Heterozygotes are detected by mating the animal in question to either known heterozygotes or known homozygous recessives (other methods exist such as mating to offspring, but result in inbred offspring) and a heterozygote is detected when a ridgeless pup is born. Note that many matings are required to have a high probability of detecting a homozygous dominant (once a ridgeless pup is produced, the animal in question is assumed to be heterozygous without question), and more than one sire can produce the pups in one litter. The latter fact can cast doubt on the calling of male heterozygotes by this method and could possibly lead to the results shown in studies testing the mode of inheritance of ridgelessness.\n\n[10] UOIT Ridgebacks: The university's mascot and logo is based on a Rhodesian Ridgeback breed of dog. The idea of relating the infamous Ridgeback to the university's athletic program is that the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a large and well muscled hunting dog that is legendary for its ability and use in hunting down lions. Strong and extremely competitive by nature, the Ridgeback is also lightning quick and deftly alert while constantly paying attention to its surroundings. Known as a dominant dog with aggressive instincts, the Ridgeback moves, not only like a hunting dog, but like a dog of prey. It is strong willed and confident and thrives on vigorous exercise and athletic activities. It is equally as tough in the water as it is on land.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nHow tall is a Rhodesian Ridgeback?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

If the alarm indicates a hawk diving toward the colony, all the prairie dogs in its flight path dive into their holes, while those outside the flight path stand and watch. If the alarm is for a human, all members of the colony immediately rush inside the burrows. For coyotes, the prairie dogs move to the entrance of a burrow and stand outside the entrance, observing the coyote, while those prairie dogs that were inside the burrows will come out to stand and watch as well. For domestic dogs, the response is to observe, standing in place where they were when the alarm was sounded, again with the underground prairie dogs emerging to watch.\n\n[2] Ina Benita: The sons of Hans Georg Pasch from the previous marriage and the half brothers Tadeusz Michał Benita-Pasch were , minister in the first democratic government of Slovenia (1990-1992) and his twin brother Boris Pasch, a Slovenian diplomat in Berlin, both born in 1941.• – Films made and scheduled for release in 1939, but premiered in later years due to outbreak of World War 2\n\n[3] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[4] Watch Dogs: Following its announcement in June 2012, \"Watch Dogs\" was widely anticipated. Upon release, it received a mixed reception; praise was directed at the game's hacking elements and mission variety, while criticism was expressed concerning the discrepancy in graphics quality between marketing and the real game, plot, and protagonist. \"Watch Dogs\" was a commercial success, breaking the record for the biggest first-day sales of a Ubisoft game and becoming the biggest launch of a new intellectual property in the United Kingdom at the time. The game has shipped over 10 million copies; its sequel, \"Watch Dogs 2\", was released in November 2016.\n\n[5] Watchtower (band): Watchtower was formed in May 1982 in Austin, Texas. The quartet made its recording debut in 1983 with an early version of the song \"Meltdown\", which was included on the \"Cottage Cheese from the Lips of Death - A Texas Hardcore Compilation\" LP. It was followed by the debut album, \"Energetic Disassembly\", issued in 1985 on the band's own DIY label, Zombo Records. An earlier version of the album was scrapped after the group's label, Rainforest Records, closed its doors. \"Energetic Disassembly\" is notable for its heavy use of time changes and is considered to be a landmark in progressive metal. The album saw Watchtower tour with bands like Slayer, Anthrax, Helstar, Celtic Frost, Voivod and Armored Saint.\n\n[6] Aaahh!!! Real Monsters: On October 8, 2013, Shout!

Cockrum, Foram’s founder, chairman and CEO. “We wanted the most efficient office building ever designed, with no wasted space or wasted energy. This is a building of the future more than a building of the present. A lot of love has gone into that building, and a lot of pride.\"\n\n[8] Development of Doom: \"Doom\"s original release date was the third quarter of 1993, which the team did not meet. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop on the game, with several employees sleeping at the office; programmer Dave Taylor claimed that working on the game gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as hype for the game had been building online. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours, the development team at id uploaded the first episode of the game to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. So many users were connected to the first network that they planned to upload the game to—the University of Wisconsin–Parkside FTP network—that even after the network administrator increased the number of connections while on the phone with Wilbur, id was unable to connect, forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload the game. When the upload finished thirty minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university's network. Within hours, other university networks were banning \"Doom\" multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems.\n\n[9] Reservoir Dogs: \"Reservoir Dogs\" premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1992. It became the festival's most talked-about film, and was subsequently picked up for distribution by Miramax Films. After being shown at several other film festivals, including in Cannes, Sitges and Toronto, \"Reservoir Dogs\" opened in the United States in 19 theaters with a first week total of $147,839. It was expanded to 61 theaters and totaled $2,832,029 at the domestic box office. The film grossed more than double that in the United Kingdom, where it was banned from home video release until 1995. During the period of unavailability on home video, the film was re-released in UK cinemas in June 1994.\n\n[10] Documentary Organization of Canada: • 1983 – First meetings, first intervention letter.

After an article appeared in \"Popular Science\", there was no further work, beyond the paper stage.\n\n[2] Gas turbine: In 1950, designer F.R. Bell and Chief Engineer Maurice Wilks from British car manufacturers Rover unveiled the first car powered with a gas turbine engine. The two-seater JET1 had the engine positioned behind the seats, air intake grilles on either side of the car, and exhaust outlets on the top of the tail. During tests, the car reached top speeds of , at a turbine speed of 50,000 rpm. The car ran on petrol, paraffin (kerosene) or diesel oil, but fuel consumption problems proved insurmountable for a production car. It is on display at the London Science Museum.\n\n[3] Gardner (automobile): For 1927 and 1929 the eights were the only engines used. The interior of the Series 90 cars had many high-quality materials, such as silver-finished hardware, silk window curtains, walnut wood pieces and mohair upholstery (Series 75 and 80 did not have walnut in the interior.) All cars had a gas gauge and temp. gauge standard. During the summer of 1929, Gardner announced two \"very important\" automobile contracts. The first was with Sears, Roebuck and Company, who wanted Gardner to develop a new car to be sold by mail order. The other was with New Era Motors, to manufacture the front-wheel-drive Ruxton. With the stock market crash in late 1929, both deals were off.\n\n[4] Sintz Gas Engine Company: Clark had been undertaking pioneering engine work both on his own and with John F Endter. John Foos held the patent. In 1885 the company demonstrated a small 2-cycle engine in a small boat. The engine was based on a Dugald Clerk design. Clerk was a Scottish engineer who had patented the engine in the 1870s. Foos formed his own company, Foos Gas Engine Company, in 1889 using his own improved version of Clark Sintz's engine. In 1894 Elwood Haynes used a Sintz engine in his first car, as did Milton Reeves in 1896.\n\n[5] Delamare-Deboutteville: Delamare-Deboutteville was among the earliest designs of car, driven by an internal combustion engine. It was developed in France by Édouard Delamare-Deboutteville and patented in 1884, but did not achieve commercial success. Édouard Delamare-Deboutteville described how, with his assistant Leon Malandin, he had built and driven his car in early 1884. The car had a front bench seat and a rear platform, four wheels, a transmission to the rear wheels by chain, shaft transmission and a differential. In 1883 Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville made a trial run of a car whose engine was powered by gas; but the gas supply hose broke during this first trial, so he replaced the gas with fuel oil. In order to use this product, he invented a wick carburetor. This vehicle travelled for the first time on the little road from Fontaine-le-Bourg to Cailly in Normandy in early February 1884. On 12 February 1884, he registered his design under patent number 160267. Several replicas were made of the Delamare-Deboutteville design and have been entered in all kinds of different events.\n\n[6] Gas turbine: The first turbine-powered car built in the US was the GM Firebird I which began evaluations in 1953. While photos of the Firebird I may suggest that the jet turbine's thrust propelled the car like an aircraft, the turbine actually drove the rear wheels. The Firebird 1 was never meant as a commercial passenger car and was solely built for testing & evaluation as well as public relation purposes. Starting in 1954 with a modified Plymouth, the American car manufacturer Chrysler demonstrated several prototype gas turbine-powered cars from the early 1950s through the early 1980s. Chrysler built fifty Chrysler Turbine Cars in 1963 and conducted the only consumer trial of gas turbine-powered cars. Each of their turbines employed a unique rotating recuperator, referred to as a regenerator that increased efficiency.\n\n[7] Aero-engined car: Turbine engines have also been utilized in concept and prototype road cars, such as the three General Motors Firebirds, the Fiat Turbina, and the Chrysler Turbine Car. In 1953, the General Motors XP-21 Firebird I became the first car powered by a gas turbine engine to be built in the United States. Never intended for production, the car was purely a design exercise to determine the feasibility of turbine-powered road cars. The car's body, which was made of plastic reinforced by fiberglass, was designed by Harley J. Earl, while its Whirlfire Turbo-Power engine was developed by Charles L. McCuen and the GM Research Laboratories Division. Driving the rear wheels of the car via a conventional transmission, the engine was able to produce at 13,000 rpm. Its successor, Firebird II, debuted at General Motors Motorama in 1956. In addition to its regenerative gas turbine, the car featured a titanium body, fully independent suspension, power disc brakes, electric gear selection, and air conditioning that could be individually controlled. The last of GM's Firebirds, Firebird III, was built in 1958. It was the only Firebird to influence any GM production cars; both the 1959 and 1961 Cadillac lineups took styling cues from it. Noted for its extravagant tailfins, Firebird III also broke a number of Earl's styling rules with its very reserved use of chrome and lack of parallel lines. While GM planned a Firebird IV\n\n[8] Technology during World War I: At the beginning of the war, Germany had the most advanced chemical industry in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world's dye and chemical production. Although the use of poison gas had been banned by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, Germany turned to this industry for what it hoped would be a decisive weapon to break the deadlock of trench warfare. Chlorine gas was first used on the battlefield in April 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium. The unknown gas appeared to be a simple smoke screen, used to hide attacking soldiers, and Allied troops were ordered to the front trenches to repel the expected attack. The gas had a devastating effect, killing many defenders or when the wind direction changed and blew the gas back, many attackers. Because the gas killed the attackers, depending on the wind, a more reliable way had to be made to transmit the gas. It began being delivered in artillery shells. Later, mustard gas, phosgene and other gases were used. Britain and France soon followed suit with their own gas weapons. The first defenses against gas were makeshift, mainly rags soaked in water or urine. Later, relatively effective gas masks were developed, and these greatly reduced the effectiveness of gas as a weapon. Although it sometimes resulted in brief tactical advantages and probably caused over 1,000,000 casualties, gas seemed to\n\n[9] Robert Muldoon: Concerned about the use of foreign exchange during the 1970s' oil crises, Muldoon supported a scheme whereby natural gas or a dual-fuel gas–petrol system could power cars. Muldoon's 1979 budget introduced incentives to encourage the conversions, and New Zealand emerged as possibly the first country to have dual-fuel cars as a commonplace sight. However, the projection that oil prices would become ever-higher did not happen during this period.\n\n[10] Gas turbine: The first race car (in concept only) fitted with a turbine was in 1955 by a US Air Force group as a hobby project with a turbine loaned them by Boeing and a race car owned by Firestone Tire & Rubber company. The first race car fitted with a turbine for the goal of actual racing was by Rover and the BRM Formula One team joined forces to produce the Rover-BRM, a gas turbine powered coupe, which entered the 1963 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Graham Hill and Richie Ginther. It averaged and had a top speed of . American Ray Heppenstall joined Howmet Corporation and McKee Engineering together to develop their own gas turbine sports car in 1968, the Howmet TX, which ran several American and European events, including two wins, and also participated in the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans. The cars used Continental gas turbines, which eventually set six FIA land speed records for turbine-powered cars.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the question with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It was the 120th annual Grand Final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers of the 2016 AFL season. The match, attended by 99,981 spectators, was won by the Bulldogs by a margin of 22 points, marking the club's second VFL/AFL premiership victory and first since 1954. It was also the first time in VFL/AFL history that a team won the premiership from seventh place on the ladder. Jason Johannisen of the Bulldogs was awarded the Norm Smith Medal as the best player on the ground.\n\n[2] AFL Grand Final: So when the MCG was finally relinquished by the government in August 1946, there was great expectation in the buildup to the grand final, where Essendon booted a record score to defeat Melbourne. Attendances were back to 1930s levels by 1947 and 85,815 turned up to see Carlton beat Essendon by a solitary point; a similar crowd a year later watched the Bombers and Demons play the first draw in grand final history. Melbourne won the replay the following week. The sight of thousands sitting between the fence and the boundary line, first seen in the late 1930s, was now usual at the grand final. Spectators were admitted on a first-come basis, and thousands took to lining up outside the stadium in the days before the match to gain the best vantage point when the gates opened on the morning of the match. Some reservations were raised about spectator safety as the MCG was clearly being filled above its capacity.\n\n[3] 1997 AFL Grand Final: The 1997 AFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Adelaide Football Club and the St Kilda Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 27 September 1997. It was the 101st annual grand final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers for the 1997 AFL season. The match, attended by 99,645 spectators, was won by Adelaide by a margin of 31 points, marking that club's first premiership victory.\n\n[4] 2009 AFL Grand Final: It was also the first grand final to be played since the death of cartoonist William Ellis Green (better known as WEG), who had been drawing victory posters after VFL/AFL grand finals since 1954. The posters had been sold after each Grand Final with the proceeds going to the Royal Children's Hospital. Beginning in 2009, the posters were drawn by cartoonist Mark Knight of the \"Herald Sun\".\n\n[5] 2010 AFL Grand Final: The 2010 AFL Grand Final was a series of two Australian rules football matches between the Collingwood Football Club and the St Kilda Football Club. Together they are considered the 114th annual grand final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), and were staged to determine the premiers for the 2010 AFL season. The premiership is usually decided by a single match; however, as the first grand final ended in a draw, a grand final replay was played the following week and was won by Collingwood. Both grand finals were held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne. The first was held on 25 September 2010. The game was attended by 100,016 spectators, the highest crowd for a VFL/AFL game since the 1986 VFL Grand Final. The match ended in a draw, with both teams scoring 68 points. This was the third draw in a VFL/AFL grand final, the previous two occurring in 1948 and 1977.\n\n[6] 1992 AFL Grand Final: The 1992 AFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the West Coast Eagles and the Geelong Football Club, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 26 September 1992. It was the 96th annual Grand Final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers for the 1992 AFL season. The match, attended by 95,007 spectators, was won by West Coast by a margin of 28 points, marking that club's first premiership victory and the first by a team based outside the state of Victoria.\n\n[7] 2001 AFL Grand Final: The 2001 AFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Essendon Football Club and the Brisbane Lions, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 29 September 2001. It was the 105th annual grand final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers for the 2001 AFL season. The match, attended by 91,482 spectators, was won by Brisbane by a margin of 26 points, marking that club's first premiership victory.\n\n[8] 1990 VFA season: The Grand Final was originally scheduled for Sunday, 23 September; this was intended to be a vacant day in the Australian Football League's finals fixture, meaning that the Association Grand Final was to be the premier football event in Melbourne on the day. However, these plans were disrupted on Saturday, 8 September, when the Australian Football League Qualifying Final between and was drawn; it was replayed on Saturday, 15 September. As a result of the adjusted AFL finals fixture, the Association Grand Final was now scheduled to clash with the AFL Second Semi-Final. To overcome this, the Association pushed the date of the Grand Final back to Sunday, 30 September.\n\n[9] 2017 AFL Women's Grand Final: The inaugural season of the AFL Women's competition, which featured eight teams, made use of a best-two qualification system straight through to the grand final, instead of a finals series system similar to the Australian Football League (AFL). The top two teams on the premiership ladder at the end of a seven-round home-and-away season would compete for the premiership in the grand final. The team that wins the minor premiership also wins the rights to host the match. The date of the match was set for 25 March, serving as a curtain-raiser match for the first round of the 2017 AFL season. The match was scheduled for an early afternoon start at 1:00 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time to boost attendance and television ratings, when no AFL matches were occurring—the first match of the day, a clash between and , was scheduled for a 4:35 pm start time. Three days before the match, the starting time was changed to five minutes earlier (12:55 pm) due to the application of the heat policy, with the quarter and half-time breaks extended.\n\n[10] 2004 AFL Grand Final: The 2004 AFL Grand Final was an Australian rules football game contested between the Port Adelaide Football Club and the Brisbane Lions, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne on 25 September 2004. It was the 108th annual grand final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers for 2004 AFL season. The match was won by Port Adelaide by a margin of 40 points, marking that club's first AFL premiership victory. It was attended by 77,671 spectators (the lowest grand final attendance since 1991, and the lowest at the MCG since the 1948 replay), with the MCG's capacity being reduced due to construction work prior to the 2006 Commonwealth Games.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Flogging is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption. Due to Sharia courts, flogging is legal with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes. Between 2007 and 2013, many people in the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes. In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public. Several Muslims in Abu Dhabi and Ajman were sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption. An Estonian soldier in 2006 was sentenced to 40 lashes for being drunk. Several people have been sentenced to 60 lashes for illicit sex. Sharia courts have penalized domestic workers with floggings. Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.\n\n[2] Politics of Qatar: Flogging is used in Qatar as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations. Article 88 of Qatar's criminal code declares the punishment for adultery is 100 lashes. Adultery is punishable by death when a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man are involved. In 2006, a Filipino woman was sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery. In 2010, at least 18 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to flogging of between 40 and 100 lashes for offences related to “illicit sexual relations” or alcohol consumption. In 2011, at least 21 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to floggings of between 30 and 100 lashes for offences related to “illicit sexual relations” or alcohol consumption. In 2012, six expatriates were sentenced to floggings of either 40 or 100 lashes. Only Muslims considered medically fit were liable to have such sentences carried out. It is unknown if the sentences were implemented. More recently in April 2013, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for alcohol consumption. In June 2014, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for consuming alcohol and driving under the influence. Judicial corporal punishment is common in Qatar due to the Hanbali interpretation of Sharia Law.\n\n[3] Application of Islamic law by country: Flogging is used in Qatar as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations. Article 88 of Qatar's criminal code declares the punishment for adultery is 100 lashes. Adultery is punishable by death when a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim man are involved. In 2006, a Filipino woman was sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery. In 2012, six expatriates were sentenced to floggings of either 40 or 100 lashes. More recently in April 2013, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for alcohol consumption. In June 2014, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for consuming alcohol and driving under the influence.\n\n[4] Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan: In 757 A.D., the Chinese-influenced Yoro Ritsuryo (養老律令) legal system was enacted and introduced Five Judicial Penalties (五刑). Two of the Five Judicial Penalties involved Flogging. Light Flogging provided for 10 to 50 lashes, while Heavy Flogging stipulated 60 to 100 strokes. However, a slave could be sentenced to up a maximum of 200 lashes. These flogging penalties only applied to male commoners. Convicts of the nobility, along with female commoners, might be sentenced to the imposition of handcuffs or a fine. When a convicted criminal was flogged, half the number of lashes were typically applied to the back, half to the buttocks. At times, if the convict's request to change the lash target was sanctioned then the lashes would be applied only to the back or to the buttocks. By the Age of Warring States, flogging had been largely replaced by decapitation.\n\n[5] Child Rights International Network: This reform is to stop children from being prosecuted wrongly. The CRIN does intense legal research on the states that have yet to remove these horrific sentences. In 40 states the Justice system exposes the children to Flogging, Amputation, and even Caning. These forms of punishment is referred to as Corporal Punishment . The Death Penalty on children is continued to be used today in 14 different countries. They can undergo Shootings, Hangings, Stoning, and the most popular/well-known one of all Lethal Injection. The research being conducted and the tabs being kept on the countries are all efforts in ending these cruel punishments. Key component ‘naming and shaming’ campaign.\n\n[6] Violence against women: Stoning, or lapidation, refers to a form of capital punishment whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies. Stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws of several countries, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria, as punishment for adultery. Flogging or flagellation is the act of methodically beating or whipping the human body. It is a judicial punishment in various countries for specific crimes, including sex outside marriage. These punishments employed for sexual relations outside marriage, apart from constituting a form of violence in themselves, can also deter victims of sexual violence from reporting the crime, because the victims may themselves be punished (if they cannot prove their case, if they are deemed to have been in the company of an unrelated male, or if they were unmarried and not virgins at the time of the rape).\n\n[7] Application of Islamic law by country: The court system comprises Sharia courts and civil courts. Judicial corporal punishment is a legal form of punishment in UAE due to the Sharia courts. Flogging is used in UAE as a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and prostitution. In most emirates, floggings of Muslims are frequent, especially for adultery, prostitution and drunkenness, with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes. Between 2007 and 2013, many people were sentenced to 100 lashes. Moreover, in 2010 and 2012, several Muslims were sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption. Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.\n\n[8] United Arab Emirates: Flogging is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex and alcohol consumption. According to Sharia court rulings, flogging ranges from 80 to 200 lashes. Verbal abuse pertaining to a person's honour is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes. Between 2007 and 2014, many people in the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes. More recently in 2015, two men were sentenced to 80 lashes for hitting and insulting a woman. In 2014, an expatriate in Abu Dhabi was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 80 lashes after alcohol consumption and raping a toddler. Alcohol consumption for Muslims is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many Muslims have been sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption. Sometimes 40 lashes are given. Illicit sex is sometimes penalized by 60 lashes. 80 lashes is the standard number for anyone sentenced to flogging in several emirates. Sharia courts have penalized domestic workers with floggings. In October 2013, a Filipino housemaid was sentenced to 100 lashes for illegitimate pregnancy. Drunk-driving is strictly illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many expatriates have been sentenced to 80 lashes for drunk-driving. In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public. Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes.\n\n[9] Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan: Flagellation was a common penalty for crimes such as theft and fighting. Amputation of the nose or ears replaced flogging as penalty early in the Edo period. The 8th Shōgun of Edo, Tokugawa Yoshimune introduced judicial Flogging Penalty, or \"tataki\", in 1720. A convicted criminal could be sentenced to a maximum of 100 lashes. \"Samurai\" and priests were exempt from flogging, and the penalty was applied only to commoners. The convict was stripped of all outer clothing and struck about the buttocks and back. The flogging penalty was used until 1867, though it fell out of favor from 1747 to 1795 intermittently. Both men and women could be sentenced to a flogging, though during one segment of the mid-Edo period, women were imprisoned rather than flogged.\n\n[10] Human rights in Qatar: Flogging is used in Qatar as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations. Article 88 of Qatar's criminal code declares the punishment for fornication is 100 lashes. Married men and women who commit adultery can be punished by death. In 2006, a Filipino woman was sentenced to 100 lashes for adultery. In 2010, at least 18 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to flogging of between 40 and 100 lashes for offences related to “illicit sexual relations” or alcohol consumption.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhich is the first book of the Bible alphabetically?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Chapters and verses of the Bible: Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers. In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs (parashot) that were identified by two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Peh פ indicated an \"open\" paragraph that began on a new line, while Samekh ס indicated a \"closed\" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space. These two letters begin the Hebrew words open (patuach\") and closed (sagoor\"), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the Book of Isaiah from the Dead Sea Scrolls used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the Masoretic divisions. (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as acrostics, such as several of the Psalms and most of the Book of Lamentations.)\n\n[2] Book of Nehemiah: The single book Ezra–Nehemiah, with title \"Ezra\", was translated into Greek around the middle of the 2nd century BCE. It was first proposed to be considered as two books by the early Christian scholar Origen in the 3rd century CE; and Jerome, writing in the early 5th century, noted that this division had since been adopted by Greek and Latin commentators; although in all surviving Christian Greek and Old Latin manuscripts Ezra-Nehemiah is one book denoted as 'Esdras B'. Jerome himself rejected the division in his Vulgate translation of the Bible into Latin from the Hebrew; and consequently no early Vulgate manuscripts separate the two books, and they remained undivided as a single book in the 8th century commentary of Bede, and in the 9th century bibles of Alcuin and Theodulf of Orleans. However, from the 9th century onwards, Latin bibles are found that reintroduce Origen's division; and this becomes standard in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century. It was not until 1516/17, in the first printed Rabbinic Bible of Daniel Bomberg, that the separation was generally introduced into Hebrew Bibles.\n\n[3] Biblical manuscript: For manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as Codex Alexandrinus (A) and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. Constantin von Tischendorf found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, Codex Sinaiticus, over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter aleph (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the Latin alphabet had been used, and scholars moved on to first the Greek alphabet, and eventually started reusing characters by adding a superscript. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.\n\n[4] Seligman Baer: In the meantime, Baer had conceived the plan of editing anew the books of the entire Hebrew Bible, strictly following the Masoretic tradition. The volumes, with a Latin preface by Delitzsch, appeared (Leipzig, Tauchnitz) in the following order: Genesis, 1869; Isaiah, 1872; Job, 1875; Minor Prophets, 1878; Psalms (together with a treatise \"Elementa Accentuationis Metricæ\"), 1880; Proverbs (together with \"De Primorum Vocabulorum Dagessatione\"), 1880; Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah (together with \"Chaldaismi Biblici Adumbratio\" and a treatise by Friedrich Delitzsch on the Babylonian proper names in these books), were published in 1882; Ezekiel (with \"Specimen Glossarii Ezechielico-Babylonici\" by Friedrich Delitzsch), appeared in 1884; followed by the five Megillot, 1886; the book of Chronicles, 1888; Jeremiah, 1890; Joshua and Judges, 1891; and finally Kings, 1895. The last two were edited by Baer alone, Delitzsch having died in 1890.\n\n[5] Aibidil Gaoidheilge agus Caiticiosma: Aibidil Gaoidheilge agus Caiticiosma (\"Irish Alphabet and Catechism\") is the first book printed in Ireland in the Irish language. Meant as a Protestant primer, the book was written by John Kearney (), a treasurer of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin. It includes a short section on the spelling and sounds of Irish. The production of this book was part of a larger endeavour by Irish Protestants to print the Bible in the Irish language so that the common person could read it. The book was printed on a press which was set up in the home of Alderman John Ussher (Early Modern Irish: \"Seón Uiser\"). Ussher, who was a well-known Dublin Protestant, also paid for the venture. Though the printer's identity is unknown, it is possible that William Kearney, a nephew of John Kearney was the printer. 200 copies of the book were printed but only four known copies exist today. In 1995 a copy of the book was bought by Trinity College Library Dublin for £47,700 ($76,463) at Christie's.\n\n[6] Sefer Oklah we-Oklah: The sefer Oklah we-Oklah (אָכְלָה וְאָכְלָה) is an old Masoretic work in which the notices and rules of the Masorah are collected; it consists of groups of rare words or of certain peculiarities of the text arranged either alphabetically, or in the order of the books of the Bible, or according to some other principle, and contains also brief rules and notes on various phenomena found in the original text of the Bible. This work, whose author is unknown, takes its title from the first two words of the opening passage, which is an alphabetical list of words occurring only twice in the Bible, in one passage without the prefixed \"waw\" and in the other with it, the first of these pairs of words being \"oklah\" (אָכְלָה ) from 1 Samuel and \"we-oklah\" ( וְאָכְלָה ) from Genesis .\n\n[7] King James Version: Translations of the books of the Biblical apocrypha were necessary for the King James version, as readings from these books were included in the daily Old Testament lectionary of the Book of Common Prayer. Protestant Bibles in the 16th century included the books of the Apocrypha – generally, following the Luther Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments to indicate they were not considered part of the Old Testament text – and there is evidence that these were widely read as popular literature, especially in Puritan circles; The Apocrypha of the King James Version has the same 14 books as had been found in the Apocrypha of the Bishop's Bible; however, following the practice of the Geneva Bible, the first two books of the Apocrypha were renamed 1 Esdras and 2 Esdras, as compared to the names in the Thirty-nine Articles, with the corresponding Old Testament books being renamed Ezra and Nehemiah. Starting in 1630, volumes of the \"Geneva Bible\" were occasionally bound with the pages of the Apocrypha section excluded. In 1644 the Long Parliament forbade the reading of the Apocrypha in Church and in 1666 the first editions of the King James Bible without the Apocrypha were bound.\n\n[8] History of Madagascar: Before Radama I the Malagasy language was written in a script known as sorabe. In 1820 under the direction of David Jones, a Welsh missionary of the London Missionary Society, Radama I codified the new Malagasy Latin alphabet of 21 letters which replaced the old sorabe alphabet. By 1830 the Bible was the first book written in this new Malagasy Latin alphabet. It is the oldest complete translation of the bible into a sub-Saharan African language.\n\n[9] Acrostic: Relatively simple acrostics may merely spell out the letters of the alphabet in order; such an acrostic may be called an 'alphabetical acrostic' or Abecedarius. These acrostics occur in the first four of the five chapters that make up the Book of Lamentations, in the praise of the good wife in Proverbs 31, 10-31, and in Psalms 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 119 and 145 of the Hebrew Bible. Notable among the acrostic Psalms is the long Psalm 119, which typically is printed in subsections named after the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, each section consisting of 8 verses, each of which begins with the same letter of the alphabet and the entire psalm consisting of 22 x 8 = 176 verses; and Psalm 145, which is recited three times a day in the Jewish services. Some acrostic psalms are technically imperfect. E.g. Psalm 9 and Psalm 10 appear to constitute a single acrostic psalm together, but the length assigned to each letter is unequal and five of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet are not represented and the sequence of two letters is reversed. In Psalm 25 one Hebrew letter is not represented, the following letter (Resh) repeated. In Psalm 34 the current final verse, 23, does fit verse 22 in content, but adds an additional line to the poem. In Psalms 37 and 111 the numbering of verses and the division into lines are interfer\n\n[10] Alphabet book: Alphabet books introduce the sounds and letters of the ordered alphabet.

The first Walker's crisp production line was in the empty upper storey of Walker's Oxford Street factory in Leicester. In the early days the potatoes were sliced by hand and cooked in an ordinary fish and chip fryer. In 1971 the Walker's crisps business was sold to Standard Brands, an American firm, who sold on the company to Frito-Lay. Walker's crisps makes 10 million bags of crisps per day at two factories in Beaumont Leys, and is the UK's largest grocery brand. The Beaumont Leys manufacturing plant is world's largest crisp factory.\n\n[2] Walkers (snack foods): Many of Walkers brands were formerly branded under the Smiths Crisps name. This comes from the time when Walkers, Smiths and Tudor Crisps were the three main brands of Nabisco's UK snack division, with Tudor being marketed mainly in the north of England and Walkers in the south. After the takeover by PepsiCo, the Tudor name was dropped, and the Smiths brand has become secondary to Walkers. The only products currently retaining the Smiths brand are Salt & Vinegar and Ready Salted Chipsticks, Frazzles and the \"Savoury Selection\", which includes Bacon Flavour Fries, Scampi Flavour Fries and Cheese Flavoured Moments. To promote the freshness of its products, Walkers began to package them in foil bags from 1993, then from 1996, began filling them with nitrogen instead of air. In 1997, Walkers became the brand name of Quavers and Monster Munch snacks. In August 2000, Walkers launched Max, a brand with a range of crisps. More Max flavours were introduced in 2001. In the same year Walkers bought Squares, a range of snacks from Smiths.\n\n[3] Walkers (snack foods): In April 2010, the company launched a promotional campaign entitled the \"Walkers Flavour Cup\" in order to locate the world's most loved and favourite flavour. In the end, it was decided that the flavour with the most fans at the end of the tournament/competition would be declared the winner and ultimate champion of all flavours. Walkers encouraged people to engage in social media activity, and upload photos and videos to their website proving people's Superfan status of Walkers Crisps. The best fan from each of the 15 flavours won £10,000. In the end, English Roast Beef & Yorkshire Pudding won the Flavour Cup.\n\n[4] Tudor Crisps: Notably, Tudor salt and vinegar flavour crisps were sold in blue packaging and cheese and onion in green bags, like most other brands in the UK, but the move to Walkers crisps reversed the colours.\n\n[5] Walkers (snack foods): In July 2008, Walkers launched its \"Do Us a Flavour\" campaign, challenging the public to think up unique flavours for their crisps. In January 2009 six flavours were chosen from among the entries and released as special editions, available until May 2009. During this period, consumers could vote on their favourite, and the winner would become a permanent flavour. The winner was Builder's Breakfast by Emma Rushin from Belper in Derbyshire. This flavour was discontinued a year later, in May 2010, in order for Walkers to focus on the upcoming 'Flavour Cup'.\n\n[6] Wotsits: Wotsits is a British brand of cheesy flavour corn puffs sold by Walkers Crisps and originally by Golden Wonder. The most common form are cheese flavoured curly shapes. However, over the years, various other shapes and flavours have also been sold. \"Limited edition\" Wotsits have also appeared on more than one occasion. The brand was stretched into Whopping Wotsits, Weenie Wotsits, Wotsits Wafflers as well as frozen Wotsits. All came into the market under Golden Wonder's ownership managed by Sir Nigel Parrott between the years 1993 and 2002.\n\n[7] Walkers (snack foods): Walkers most common flavours of regular crisp are Ready Salted (sold in a red packet), Cheese & Onion (blue), Prawn Cocktail (pink) and Salt & Vinegar (green). Other flavours are sold in other coloured packets, such as Beef & Onion (brown), Marmite (black) and Worcester sauce (purple).\n\n[8] Walkers (snack foods): In August 2015, Walkers launched the \"Bring me Back\" campaign, reintroducing the Barbecue, Cheese and Chive, Beef and Onion, Lamb and Mint and Toasted Cheese flavours for a limited time. People could vote on the Walkers website or use hashtags to see which flavour would be reintroduced permanently. The Marmite flavour was also brought back permanently to coincide with the promotion. 'Beef and Onion' got the most votes and was reintroduced permanently.\n\n[9] Walkers (snack foods): Other products sold by Walkers include their \"Baked\" crisp range, \"Cheese Heads\", \"Crinkles\", \"Deep Ridged\", \"Extra Crunchy\" 150g bags, launched in 2010 \"Lights\" (low fat crisps, formerly \"Lites\"), \"Market Deli\" crisps, pitta chips and tortilla chips, \"Max\", \"Pops\", \"Potato Heads\" (discontinued in 2008), \"Salt 'n' Shake\", \"Sensations\", \"Squares\", \"Stars\", \"Sunbites\" (wholegrain crispy snacks) and \"Hoops and Crosses\".\n\n[10] Walkers (snack foods): Walkers is a British snack food manufacturer mainly operating in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Walkers was founded in 1948 in Leicester, England by Henry Walker, and in 1989 was acquired by Lay's owner, Frito-Lay, a division of PepsiCo. They are best known for manufacturing potato crisps, and other, non-potato-based snack foods. It holds 56 percent of the British crisps market. The Walkers site in Leicester is the largest crisp production plant in the world, producing over 11 million bags of crisps per day and using about 800 tons of potatoes.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhat is the most sold flavour of Walkers crisps?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the answer to the question \"What is the most sold flavour of Walkers crisps?\"?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\nCONTEXT:\n[7] Walkers (snack foods): Walkers most common flavours of regular crisp are Ready Salted (sold in a red packet), Cheese & Onion (blue", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nThe answer to the question is \"Ready Salted\".", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Guitarist and arranger Jimmy Vivino is the group's leader. The group was originally formed and led by drummer Max Weinberg in 1993, and played under the name The Max Weinberg 7 when it was the house band for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" in New York through 2009. The band then played under Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band during their brief 2009–2010 stint on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" in Los Angeles. They were then briefly known as The Legally Prohibited Band during their participation with O'Brien in the 2010 The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour.\n\n[2] James Wormworth: James Wormworth is an American drummer and percussionist. Wormworth is a member of Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band on the TBS late night comedy program, \"Conan\". Wormworth often appeared as house drummer during the band's run as The Max Weinberg 7 on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien.\" Wormworth joined the band as a full-time member when O'Brien became the host of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\".\n\n[3] Mike Merritt (musician): Michael Monroe \"Mike\" Merritt (born July 28, 1955) is an American bassist best known for playing with the Conan O'Brien house bands: The Max Weinberg 7 on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" in New York, Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" in Los Angeles, and currently The Basic Cable Band on \"Conan\" also in Los Angeles.\n\n[4] Late Night with Conan O'Brien: Late Night with Conan O'Brien is an American late-night talk show hosted by Conan O'Brien that aired 2,725 episodes on NBC between 1993 and 2009. The show featured varied comedic material, celebrity interviews, and musical and comedy performances. \"Late Night\" aired weeknights at 12:37 am Eastern/11:37 pm Central and 12:37 am Mountain in the United States. From 1993 until 2000, Andy Richter served as O'Brien's sidekick; following his departure, O'Brien was the show's sole featured performer. The show's house musical act was The Max Weinberg 7, led by E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg.\n\n[5] The Miami Horns: In 1993 Max Weinberg became music director for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and when putting together a band, he recruited Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg, Mark Pender and Jerry Vivino. The three played until 2009 as members of The Max Weinberg 7, which moved that year with Conan O'Brien to become the latest iteration of The Tonight Show Band. When not on TV, this trio has worked regularly as session musicians. In 2010, the trio toured North America as part of the Legally Prohibited Band (essentially The Tonight Show Band under a different name, with Weinberg's place taken by James Wormwood) in support of Conan O'Brien's 32-city \"Legally Prohibited From Being Funny On Television\" tour. They continue to be part of O'Brien's late night band as part of the Basic Cable Band on O'Brien's current show, \"Conan\".\n\n[6] The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien: Many members of the \"Late Night\" cast and crew made the transition to \"The Tonight Show\". The Max Weinberg 7, the house band from O'Brien's \"Late Night\", served as the house band under the new name, Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. Andy Richter returned to the show as announcer, and also began resuming his role as sidekick, shortly before the show's conclusion. The opening and closing theme song from \"Late Night\" was also carried over to \"Tonight\", in a slightly altered form.\n\n[7] Max Weinberg: Max Weinberg (born April 13, 1951) is an American drummer and television personality, most widely known as the longtime drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and as the bandleader for Conan O'Brien on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\".\n\n[8] Late Night with Conan O'Brien: The show's house band was The Max Weinberg 7, led by drummer Max Weinberg, who also served as a sounding board for O'Brien on the show (more so after Andy Richter's departure). The other six members were Mark Pender on trumpet, Richie \"LaBamba\" Rosenberg on trombone, Mike Merritt on bass, Jerry Vivino on saxophone and brother Jimmy Vivino on guitar, and Scott Healy on keyboards. James Wormworth served as backup drummer when Weinberg went on tour with Bruce Springsteen. With the departure of Andy Richter, Max Weinberg assumed a bigger role as an interlocutor for O'Brien's jokes. One common running gag was Max's awkwardness on camera and his apparent lack of chemistry with Conan. Weinberg was often used in sketches as well, which usually revolved around his purported sexual deviance (mostly a penchant for bedding barely legal groupies), although long-running sketches also spoofed Max's lack of knowledge of current affairs.\n\n[9] Max Weinberg: In 1993, Weinberg got the role as bandleader of The Max Weinberg 7 for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". Weinberg's drums-driven jump blues sound and his role as a comic foil prospered along with the show, giving him a second career. In 1999, Springsteen re-formed the E Street Band for a series of tours and albums; Weinberg worked out an arrangement that allowed him to play with both O'Brien and Springsteen. In 2009, Weinberg moved to the short-lived \"Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" as leader of Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. After that ended, he began touring with his own ensembles, and in 2010 chose not to follow O'Brien to the new \"Conan\" show. Weinberg continued playing with Springsteen, and in 2014 was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band.\n\n[10] Richie Rosenberg: While touring in Europe with Southside Johnny in 1993, Rosenberg got a phone call from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band drummer Max Weinberg, who had been tapped as the bandleader for \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\". Rosenberg joined fellow Miami Horns trumpeter Mark Pender on the show's band, The Max Weinberg 7. The band moved over with O'Brien to \"The Tonight Show\" in 2009 and became Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band. When Conan left as a result of the 2010 \"Tonight Show\" conflict, the band followed him again, this time to TBS, for O'Brien's new television show Conan where they were known as Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nPlease let me know when you are ready to proceed.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It is unclear exactly when IWRG started to mark the Anniversary, records confirm that they held a show to commemorate the event starting in 2010 commemorating the 48th Anniversary of \"Lucha Libre\" in Estadio de Mexico, possibly prior to that. The 2017 show was for the 55th anniversary and was held on December 3, 2013 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major \"lucha libre\" shows.\n\n[4] Arena Coliseo: The 75. Aniversario de Arena Coliseo (Spanish for \"Arena Coliseo's 75th Anniversary\") show was a major professional wrestling show produced by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) to commemorate the opening of Arena Coliseo, in 1943. The event took place on April 7, 2018, and featured six matches in total, including a guest appearances from several \"leyendas\" who had previously worked for CMLL. The main event saw Atlantis and Blue Panther defeat \"leyendas\" Fuerza Guerrera and El SatánicoUnlike most sports or sports entertainment around the world \"Lucha Libre\" holds championships in less regards compared to the prestige of winning a \"Lucha de Apuesta\", literally a \"bet match\". In a \"Lucha de Apuesta\" match each competitor \"Bets\" either their wrestling mask or hair on the outcome of the match and if they lose must unmask or have their hair shaved off in the ultimate form of humiliation. Since the mask holds a sacred place in \"Lucha Libre\" the most prestigious \"Apuesta\" is the mask, once it is lost a wrestler is not allowed to put the mask back on when wrestling. As part of the tradition an unmasked wrestler must also reveal their \"true identity\", which means give their birth name, age and wrestling experience as they lose the \"anonymity\" of the \"enmascarado\" character.

Over the years IWRG has on occasion celebrated the anniversary, although not consistently holding an anniversary show every year.\n\n[6] Lucha libre: The first \"lucha de apuestas\" was presented on July 14, 1940 at Arena México. The defending champion Murciélago (Velázquez) was so much lighter than his challenger (Octavio Gaona), he requested a further condition before he would sign the contract: Octavio Gaona would have to put his hair on the line. Octavio Gaona won the match and Murciélago unmasked, giving birth to a tradition in lucha libre.Since Lucha Libre has its roots more in Latin American professional wrestling than North American professional wrestling it retains some of the basics of the Latin American version such as more weight classes than professional wrestling in North America post World War II. Like \"old school\" European (especially British) wrestling, some Japanese wrestling and early 20th century American wrestling, Lucha Libre has a detailed weight class system patterned after boxing. Each weight class has an official upper limit, but examples of wrestlers who are technically too heavy to hold their title can be found. The following weight classes exist in Lucha Libre, as defined by the \"Comisión de Box y Lucha Libre Mexico D.F.\" (the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission), the main regulatory body in Mexico:\n\n[7] 52nd Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estado de México: The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as \"Grupo Internacional Revolución\" in Spanish) has on occasion held a major show in December to commemorate the \"birth\" of \"Lucha Libre\" in their home state.

The tournament took place on October 9 and October 10 in Tokyo's Shin-Kiba 1st Ring and Korakuen Hall venues, marking the first time the tournament has been held outside AAA's home country of Mexico. The 2017 edition of the tournament also marked the first to feature traditional two-man tag teams, as the previous tournaments had featured a number of three-man tag teams, referred to as \"trios\" in \"Lucha Libre\". The tournament showcased teams representing numerous international promotions such as the Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), Impact Wrestling, and Pro Wrestling Noah among others.\n\n[9] Legado Final (2011): Professional wrestling has been a generational tradition in \"Lucha libre\" since its inception early in the 20th century, with a great deal of second or third generation wrestlers following in the footsteps of their fathers or mothers. Several \"lucha libre\" promotions honor those traditions, often with annual tournaments such as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's \"La Copa Junior\". The Naucalpan, State of Mexico based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) has held a \"Legado Final\" (Spanish for \"Final Legacy\") on an annual basis since 2011, with the 2015 show marking the fifth time they used the name. The \"Legado Final\" show, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general will be held in \"Arena Naucalpan\", owned by the promoters of IWRG. In addition to legitimate second generation wrestlers there are a number of wrestlers who are presented as second or third generation wrestlers, normally masked wrestlers promoted as \"Juniors\". These wrestlers normally pay a royalty or fee for the use of the name, using the name of an established star to get attention from fans and promoters. Examples of such instances of fictional family relationships include Arturo Beristain, also known as \"El Hijo del Gladiador\" (\"The Son of El Gladiador\") who was not related to the original El Gladiador, or El Hijo de Cien Caras who paid Cien Caras for the rights to use the\n\n[10] 49th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estado de México: The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; sometimes referred to as \"Grupo Internacional Revolución\" in Spanish) has on occasion held a a major show in December to commemorate the \"birth\" of \"Lucha Libre\" in its home state.

Shal Bhanjika, the celestial apsara of the 11th century fixed on the tableau was attired in this printed fabric.\n\n[3] Bastille Day military parade: United States President Donald Trump attended the 2017 parade as the foreign guest for that year, marking the centennial since the United States entry into the First World War. The parade for that year had an estimated 6,500 personnel marching in the march past proper alone, while United States Armed Forces (United States Army Europe, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Naval Forces Europe, United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa) delegations (with a combined total of 2,100 personnel) were expected to take part in the celebrations. That year, President Emmanuel Macron made his holiday address, the first President to do so in the parade grandstand, before the parade began. This was the parade that the reconstituted National Guard took part for the very first time since its reactivation months earlier. A medley of Daft Punk songs was played that year\n\n[4] National day: Importance attached to the national day as well as the degree to which it is celebrated vary greatly from country to country. For example, Spain's national day Fiesta Nacional de España is held on 12 October, the day celebrated in other countries as Columbus Day or \"Día de la Raza\", and commemorates the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas. A military parade is held in Madrid celebrating the occasion. The national day in France is 14 July and known as the \"Fête nationale\" (known in English-speaking countries as Bastille Day) commemorating the Storming of the Bastille, which is considered the start of the French Revolution. It is widely celebrated and the French Tricolour is much in evidence, while the President of the Republic attends a military parade on the Champs-Élysées of Paris. In the United States, the Independence Day celebrations on 4 July are widely celebrated with parades, fireworks, picnics and barbecues. In Ireland, Saint Patrick's Day, 17 March, is the equivalent of a national day and has been a public holiday for many years. However, in the United Kingdom the constituent countries' patron saints' days are low-key affairs. In recent times campaigns have commenced to promote the national days of England, Scotland and Wales, with St. Andrew's Day being designated as an official bank holiday when the Scottish Parliament passed the St Andrew's Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Act 2007. A National Day for the United Kingdom has also been propos\n\n[5] Flag Day (United States): Quincy, Massachusetts, has had an annual Flag Day parade since 1952 and claims it \"is the longest-running parade of its kind\" in the U.S. The largest Flag Day parade is held annually in Troy, New York, which bases its parade on the Quincy parade and typically draws 50,000 spectators. In addition, the Three Oaks, Michigan, Flag Day Parade is held annually on the weekend of Flag Day and is a three-day event and they claim to have the largest flag day parade in the nation as well as the oldest. In Washington, D.C., Flag Day is celebrated heavily through the 7th and 8th Wards of the city. It is said that Clyde Thompson is the \"Godfather of Flag Day\". It is tradition in these wards to slow smoke various meats and vegetables.\n\n[6] National Independence Day Parade: The National Independence Day Parade also known as the July 4th Parade is an annual military/civilian parade in the National Capital Region of the United States that is held on the occasion of the Forth of July holiday. It is the largest and foremost parade held in the United States during the holiday celebrations. It has historically taken place on the capital's Constitution Avenue and usually goes past many national monuments until the parade one mile parade route ends at 17th Street. The 2 hour parade includes marching bands, military units, floats, balloons, equestrian units, and drill teams. The parade is sponsored by the National Park Service, which organizes the parade events. Annual performers and contingents include the 257th Army Band, the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, the joint-services honor guard, officers of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and the representatives of the high schools inside the DCPS.\n\n[7] Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben: Generally, Von Steuben Day takes place in September in many cities throughout the United States. It is often considered the German-American event of the year. Participants march, dance, wear German costumes and play German music, and the event is attended by millions of people. The German-American Steuben Parade is held annually in September in New York City. It is one of the largest parades in the city and is traditionally followed by an Oktoberfest in Central Park as well as celebrations in Yorkville, Manhattan, a German section of New York City. The German-American Steuben Parade has been taking place since 1958. Chicago also hosts a von Steuben Day parade, which is featured in the U.S. film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\". Philadelphia hosts a smaller Steuben Parade in the Northeast section of the city.\n\n[8] South Boston: The year 1976 marked the 200th anniversary of Evacuation Day and the 75th anniversary of the parade. A reenactment of the 1776 evacuation was incorporated into the parade, with fireworks and period costumes. President George H.W. Bush declared March Irish-American Heritage Month in 1991. The application of the Irish American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, or GLIB, to march in the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade in 1992, the first of its kind in the history of the parade, was met with a rejection by the South Boston Allied War Veterans Council. In recent years, parade organizers have tried to make the event more kid-friendly, by incorporating \"family zones\" or sober places to watch the parade. The South Boston, St. Patrick’s Parade is listed as the second-largest parade in the country, being viewed by nearly 600,000 to 1 million people every year, in addition to having the entire parade seen on live television.\n\n[9] Military parade: Currently the Chilean Armed Forces and the Carabineros de Chile hold public parades in front of state leaders and the public onLocal level parades are marked on the following days aside from 21 May:The annual military parade in the French capital of Paris is held on July 14 during the Bastille Day holiday. It is currently the oldest and largest military parade on the European continent. It is held on the Champs-Élysées and passes from l'Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. Bastille Day parades are also held in smaller garrison towns such as Toulon and Belfort. The 1st Infantry Regiment of the French Republican Guard regularly performs ceremonial marchpasts in is role as the guard of honour for the President of the French Republic. Like the British, many French units have the ability to march in slow and quick time.\n\n[10] Saint Patrick's Day in the United States: This western Massachusetts factory town was the site of massive Irish immigration in the 19th century and hosts a parade its organizers claim is the second largest in the United States. It is scheduled on the Sunday following Saint Patrick's Day each year. Attendance exceeds 300,000, with over 25,000 marchers through a 2.3-mile route in the city of 40,000. A 10K road race and many events create a remarkable festival weekend. Each year an Irish-American who has distinguished himself or herself in his or her chosen profession is awarded the John F. Kennedy National Award. JFK was a National Award Winner in the 1958 Holyoke Parade. Other winners include author Tom Clancy, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge, and actor Pat O'Brien.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

In a 2002 UK poll conducted by Channel 4, the British public voted the match #10 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.' The \"New York Times\" tennis writer Neil Amdur wrote in 2011: \"I covered the 1980 Wimbledon men’s singles final between McEnroe and Borg. Until the 2008 Nadal–Federer classic at the All England Club, the Borg–McEnroe five-setter at Wimbledon was the greatest tennis match I had ever seen, but after watching chunks of the 3:53 McEnroe–Borg final at an HBO screening, I am tempted again to reaffirm its place as the sport’s single most compelling piece of court magic\".\n\n[3] 1884 Wimbledon Championships: The 1884 Wimbledon Championships took place on the outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom.

That December, Voltaire moved to Holland for two months and became acquainted with the scientists Herman Boerhaave and 's Gravesande. From mid-1739 to mid-1740 Voltaire lived largely in Brussels, at first with the Marquise, who was unsuccessfully attempting to pursue a 60-year-old family legal case regarding the ownership of two estates in Limburg. In July 1740, he traveled to the Hague on behalf of Frederick in an attempt to dissuade a dubious publisher, van Duren, from printing without permission Frederick's \"Anti-Machiavel\". In September Voltaire and Frederick (now King) met for the first time in Moyland Castle near Cleves and in November Voltaire was Frederick's guest in Berlin for two weeks; in September 1742 they met in Aix-la-Chapelle. Voltaire was sent to Frederick's court in 1743 by the French government as an envoy and spy to gauge Frederick's military intentions in the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\n[2] Ferney-Voltaire: During Voltaire's residence, the population of Ferney increased to more than 1,000. Voltaire lived there for the last 20 years of his life before returning to Paris, where he died in 1778.\n\n[3] Voltaire: In Russia, Catherine the Great had been reading Voltaire for sixteen years prior to becoming Empress in 1762. In October 1763, she began a correspondence with the philosopher that continued till his death. The content of these letters has been described as being akin to a student writing to a teacher. Upon Voltaire's death, the Empress purchased his library, which was then transported and placed in The Hermitage. Alexander Herzen remarked that \"The writings of the egoist Voltaire did more for liberation than those of the loving Rousseau did for brotherhood.\" In his famous letter to N. V. Gogol, Vissarion Belinsky wrote that Voltaire \"stamped out the fires of fanaticism and ignorance in Europe by ridicule.\"\n\n[4] Aurelio Voltaire: Voltaire's father died when he was four months old. At ten months old, Voltaire emigrated to New Jersey with his mother and sister and his mother remarried. However, he states that he did not enjoy residing there, stating he was a victim of bullying because of his heritage and strange hobbies and interests. At the age of ten, Voltaire was inspired by the films of Ray Harryhausen (\"Jason and the Argonauts\", \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\"), and began animating on a super 8 camera. By piecing together snippets of information from fanzines, he eventually was able to teach himself how to make foam rubber animation models and animate them. His stepfather was abusive, considering Voltaire's strange hobbies and interests to indicate he was homosexual. A family friend sexually molested him from infancy into his teenage years. His girlfriend at the time committed suicide, which made him consider doing the same. Before he followed through, he promised himself to live one more day, doing and saying what he wanted to do and say. This allowed him to stand up to the people who were bullying him, and instantly elevated his self-esteem. Though he considered committing suicide again the next day, he was able to hold it off indefinitely. At the age of 17, he ran away from home and moved to New York City. His first job there was an animator with Parker Brothers. Voltaire says that he loves New York, and that the only\n\n[5] Voltaire: According to Victor Hugo: \"To name Voltaire is to characterize the entire eighteenth century.\" Goethe regarded Voltaire to be the greatest literary figure in modern times, and possibly of all times. According to Diderot, Voltaire's influence on posterity would extend far into the future. Napoleon commented that till he was sixteen he \"would have fought for Rousseau against the friends of Voltaire, today it is the opposite...The more I read Voltaire the more I love him. He is a man always reasonable, never a charlatan, never a fanatic.\" Frederick the Great commented on his good fortune for having lived in the age of Voltaire, and corresponded with him throughout his reign until Voltaire's death. In England, Voltaire's views influenced Godwin, Paine, Mary Wollstonecraft, Bentham, Byron and Shelley. Macaulay made note of the fear that Voltaire's very name incited in tyrants and fanatics.\n\n[6] Jacqueline Voltaire: Voltaire was born as Jacqueline Anne Walter Clisson in Warwickshire, England, United Kingdom, on November 6, 1948. She lived in several countries and continents during her early life, including France, Germany, the United States and parts of Africa, before settling in Mexico, where she lived for over thirty years. She first worked as a dancer and performer. She danced in some of the world's most famous nightclubs, including the Moulin Rouge, the Casino de Paris and Le Lido. She became fluent in Spanish, Italian and French through her career and travels.\n\n[7] Candide: It is unknown exactly when Voltaire wrote \"Candide\", but scholars estimate that it was primarily composed in late 1758 and begun as early as 1757. Voltaire is believed to have written a portion of it while living at Les Délices near Geneva and also while visiting Charles Théodore, the Elector-Palatinate at Schwetzingen, for three weeks in the summer of 1758. Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote \"Candide\" in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work by Lucien Perey (real name: Clara Adèle Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras. The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise \"Candide\", but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year. \"Candide\" is mature and carefully developed, not impromptu, as the intentionally choppy plot and the aforementioned myth might suggest. There is only one extant manuscript of \"Candide\" that was written before the work's 1759 publication; it was discovered in 1956 by Wade and since named the \"La Vallière Manuscript\". It is believed to have been sent, chapter by chapter, by Voltaire to the Duke and Duchess La Vallière in the autumn of 1758. The manuscript was sold to the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in the late eighteenth century, where it remained undiscovered\n\n[8] Voltaire in Love: Voltaire in Love is a popular history of the sixteen-year relationship between Voltaire and the Émilie, the Marquise du Châtelet. Written by Nancy Mitford and first published in 1957, the book also explores the French Enlightenment. In March 1729 Voltaire was allowed to go back to France. In spite of his love for England, he had become homesick; like many a Frenchman, he could not stand the austerity. In well-to-do houses, according to him, there was no silver on the table; tallow candles were burnt by all but the very rich; the food everywhere was uneatable. The arts of society, the art of pleasing were hardly cultivated and social life very dull compared with that in France. Furthermore, the weather did not suit his “unhappy machine.” He often said that his unhappy machine demanded a Southern climate but that between the countries where one sweats and those where one thinks, he was obliged to choose the latter.’\n\n[9] Voltaire: The town of Ferney, where Voltaire lived out the last 20 years of his life, was officially named Ferney-Voltaire in honor of its most famous resident in 1878. His \"château\" is a museum. Voltaire's library is preserved intact in the National Library of Russia at Saint Petersburg, Russia. In the Zurich of 1916, the theatre and performance group who would become the early avant-garde movement Dada named their theater The Cabaret Voltaire. A late-20th-century industrial music group then named themselves after the theater. Astronomers have bestowed his name to the Voltaire crater on Deimos and the asteroid 5676 Voltaire.\n\n[10] Louis XV of France: In the 1740s Voltaire was welcomed to the court as a playwright and poet, but his low rank as the son of a notary and the fact his father was also a Jansenist soon displeased the King and the Queen, and he was finally forced to depart Versailles. He went to Berlin, where he became a counselor to Frederick the Great, before living in Geneva and Savoy, far from Paris. On one issue in particular Voltaire took the side of Louis XV; when the King suppressed the \"parlements\" of nobles, demanded that all classes be taxed equally, and removed the charges which plaintiffs had to pay in order to have their cases heard. He wrote: \"Parlements of the King! You are charged with rendering justice to the people! Render justice upon yourselves!...There is in the entire world no judicial court which has ever tried to share the power of the sovereign.\" However, the King's lack of further reforms in his last years disappointed Voltaire. When the King died, Voltaire wrote of his reign, \"Fifty-six years, consumed with fatigues and wanderings.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\n\nNo, answer is not present in the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Their corporate parents are too busy at work and teen insanity rules! That is until their Dad, Dave Keller, gets fired and decides to work from home in the Keller attic. To feel useful, Dave launches the Keller Family Corp. and sets about \"reinvolving\" himself in the lives of his teenage kids, much to his offspring's total embarrassment. Whenever a problem occurs, Dad looks to his years of business knowledge to find the solution, whether it is getting to know his kids through in-depth marketing surveys or outsourcing all their phone messages to India.

As a result, both Autotrader.com and State Farm pulled their advertising from the show. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called on both Turner and TBS to take action. Both Bee and TBS apologized. Accepting a Television Academy Honors award later for \"Full Frontal\"’s #MeToo coverage, Bee said, \"Every week I strive to show the world as I see it, unfiltered. Sometimes I should probably have a filter. I accept that. Stories about 1,500 missing unaccompanied migrant children flooded the news cycle over the weekend. So last night we aired a segment on the atrocious treatment of migrant children by this administration and past administrations. Our piece attracted controversy of the worst kind... We spent the day wrestling with the repercussions of one bad word when we all should have spent the day incensed that as a nation we are wrenching children from their parents and treating people legally seeking asylum as criminals. If we are O.K. with that, then really, who are we?\"\n\n[4] Anthony Sagar: In TV comedy he appeared in \"Steptoe and Son\" as George in the episode \"Full House\" in 1963, and appeared in two episodes of the popular BBC sitcom \"Dad's Army\" – as Drill Sergeant Gregory in \"Room at the Bottom\" (1969) and as the Sergeant Major in \"Fallen Idol\" (1970); he also played a Police Sergeant in the 1971 film version.\n\n[5] Brian Basset: Following his layoff at the Seattle Times, Basset became a full-time Work-From-Home Dad and his comic strip reflected this changing reality as Adam Newman went from Stay-At-Home Dad to harried home-office worker.\n\n[6] Stay-at-home dad: Robert Frank, a professor of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children on a day-to-day basis than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.\n\n[7] Brian Part: Part describes his \"Little House\" adventure as \"the most wonderful experience anyone could ever have.\" He also says that he was very close to many of the cast members and that both Michael Landon and Victor French, his television dad, were father figures for him, having lost his own dad as a child. Brian was also close to the rest of his on-screen family, Bonnie Bartlett, Radames Pera, and Kyle Richards.\n\n[8] Stay-at-home dad: A stay-at-home dad (alternatively, stay at home father, house dad, SAHD, househusband, or house-spouse) is a father who is the main caregiver of the children and is generally the homemaker of the household. As families have evolved, the practice of being a stay-at-home dad has become more common and socially acceptable. Pre Industrialisation, the family worked together as a unit and was self-sufficient. When affection-based marriages emerged in the 1830s, parents began devoting more attention to children and family relationships became more open. Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, large-scale production replaced home manufacturing; this shift, coupled with prevailing norms governing sex or gender roles, dictated that the father become the breadwinner and the mother the caregiver.\n\n[9] List of Full House and Fuller House characters: Matt Harmon (portrayed by John Brotherton) is D.J.'s partner at the Harmon/Fuller Pet Care. He originally intended to fill in for his dad while he was away on a trip to India but decides to stay in San Francisco. When his dad retires he has Matt and D.J. take over the business. Matt and Steve fight for D.J.'s affection. She and him eventually begin dating. While in Japan for Steve and C.J's wedding, Matt proposed to D.J. and she says yes. The next day at the wedding Steve calls off his wedding, and D.J. breaks off her engagement. A heartbroken Matt walks off. He goes on an eight-day vacation and when he comes back to work he tells D.J. he doesn't know how he able to work with her if they’re not together anymore. He takes some time off to think, and when he returns he tells her that he will be opening up a new pet clinic two blocks down. He opens his new clinic and tries to sabotage her business as a way to hurt her like she did him. His clinic doesn't last long when him and DJ realize they work better together as partners. Matt eventually starts dating Gia much to DJ's annoyance. Before becoming a doctor Matt used to be an underwear model.\n\n[10] List of Full House and Fuller House characters: In \"Fuller House\", Jesse, Becky, and Danny all move to Los Angeles. Jesse becomes the music composer for \"General Hospital\" while Becky and Danny start a new nationally syndicated talk show called, \"Wake Up USA\". In the season two finale, Jesse and Becky adopt a baby girl whom they name Pamela after his sister. Somewhere along the line Jesse became a stay at home dad. When Becky and Danny get fired from \"Wake Up USA\", they try to get their old jobs back but the station only wanted her back to co-host an all women's talk show. Jesse, Becky and Pamela are all moving back to San Francisco, and he also bought back the Smash Club (which is now a laundromat) along with Joey.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWho was the dad on Full House?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It forms a two-component system with a reductase (StyB, StyA2B). The reductase utilizes solely NADH to reduce the FAD, which is then transferred to the styrene monooxygenase (StyA, StyA1). Two types of that enzyme are described so far: StyA/StyB (designated E1), first described from \"Pseudomonas\" species, and StyA1/StyA2B (designated E2), first described from Actinobacteria. The E1-type is more abundant in nature and comprises a single monooxygenase (StyA) supported by a single reductase (StyB), whereas the E2-type has a major monooxygenase (StyA1) which is supported by fusion protein of a monooxygenase and reductase (StyA2B). The latter one is the source of reduced FAD for the monooxygenase subunits and has some side activity as a monooxygenase. So far all styrene monooxygenases perform enantioselective epoxidations of styrene and chemically analogous compounds, which makes them interesting for biotechnological applications.\n\n[6] ᅱ: ᅱ is one of the Korean hangul.

Taylor crossed the Rio Grande on 18 May, Arista's army having abandoned their artillery, sick and wounded at Linares, Nuevo Leon during their retreat to Monterrey. Before accepting a prisoner exchange with General Arista, Taylor was noted for his humane treatment of the abandoned wounded Mexican soldiers, giving them the same care as was given to the American wounded. After tending to the wounded he performed the last rites for the dead of both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle.\n\n[2] Battle of Big Dry Wash: Four men received the Medal of Honor for actions at this battle: Thomas Cruse, George H. Morgan, Charles Taylor, and Frank West. Cruse, Morgan, and West were all Lieutenants and West Point graduates. Taylor was a career soldier and troop First Sergeant at the time of the battle. This engagement was the last major battle between the United States Army and Apache warriors, the wars were not over yet however. The U.S. army would soon begin the Geronimo Campaign which ended with Geronimo's capture in 1886. Even then Apache attacks on white settlers in Arizona continued as late as the year 1900.\n\n[3] USS Taylor (DD-468): \"Taylor\" departed Leyte Gulf on 4 January 1945 in the screen for the cruisers in the covering force. The next day, the destroyer sighted two torpedoes running toward her formation. After giving the submarine alarm, \"Taylor\" launched a depth-charge attack on the enemy submarine—a midget. Following those attacks, she rammed the small submarine and sent it on its last dive. During the Allied approach to Lingayen Gulf and in the days following the landings, the Japanese subjected \"Taylor\" and her sister ships to a series of heavy air raids. \"Taylor\"s antiaircraft gunners assisted in splashing at least two of the attackers. Through the end of January, the warship screened the cruisers and the escort carriers on patrol west of Luzon.\n\n[4] USS Taylor (DD-468): Following the Battle of Kolombangara, \"Taylor\" reported back to TF 31 and resumed support for the amphibious operations in the central Solomons. On the night of 15–16 July, the destroyer took \"Helena\" survivors off Vella Lavella Island where they had found refuge after their ship went down. Almost a week later, on the night of 23–24 July, the destroyer supported the landings at Enogai Inlet and participated in another bombardment of Bairoko Harbor. The following morning, her main battery joined in a bombardment of the Japanese positions around the Munda area of New Georgia.\n\n[5] USS Taylor (DD-468): On the night of 2 October, she, \"Terry\" (DD-513), and \"Ralph Talbot\" (DD-390) engaged enemy barges and a surface force in the waters between Choiseul and Kolombangara. Four nights later came the big action of the Vella Lavella and Kolombangara evacuations, the Battle of Vella Lavella. While south of New Georgia escorting a convoy, \"Taylor\", \"Ralph Talbot\", and \"La Valette\" (DD-448) were ordered to join \"O'Bannon\", \"Chevalier\", and \"Selfridge\" already embroiled in a slugfest with nine Japanese destroyers covering the Vella Lavella evacuation group. During the ensuing battle, the American and Japanese forces traded torpedo salvoes and gunfire, as well as exchanged destroyer \"Chevalier\" for . During the battle, \"Selfridge\" also received a torpedo hit and \"O'Bannon\" ran into \"Chevalier\"s stern, but neither was lost. \"Taylor\" went alongside \"Selfridge\" in the closing moments of the battle and evacuated most of her crew while a skeleton crew began their successful attempt to save the damaged destroyer. She then screened the two cripples while they limped back down the \"Slot\" to Purvis Bay.\n\n[6] George R. Wicker: The conflict is to be known as \"The Battle of Sugar Point\" and is the last recorded battle between U.S. Army troops and American Indians. The Battle of Sugar Point, or the Battle of Leech Lake, was fought on October 5, 1898 between the 3rd Infantry and members of the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians in a failed attempt to apprehend Pillager Ojibwe Bugonaygeshig (\"Old Bug\" or \"Hole-In-The-Day\"), as the result of a dispute with Indian Service officials on the Leech Lake Reservation in Cass County, Minnesota. Often referred to as \"the last Indian Uprising in the United States\", the engagement is also the first battle to be fought in the Northwest United States since the Winnebago War in 1827. It is considered by American War Historians to be the last battle fought between Native Americans and the U.S. Army.\n\n[7] USS Taylor (DD-468): Between 18 and 24 October, \"Taylor\" was a unit of the screen for the second reinforcement echelon for the Leyte invasion. During a Japanese aerial assault on the 24th, the destroyer laid a smoke screen to protect the convoy. That night, as the Battle of Surigao Strait opened, \"Taylor\" and the other destroyers of her division were anchored near the entrance of San Pedro Bay. Though she did not actually join the surface engagement, \"Taylor\" joined the support force on the following morning. Following that, she patrolled the vicinity of Dinagat Island with a unit known as the \"torpedo attack force\". On 27 and 28 October, the warship screened TG 77.4, the escort carrier group. During that duty, she rescued a downed fighter pilot of \"Enterprise\" (CV-6) and a seaman from \"Petrof Bay\" (CVE-80). Frequently, she helped fend off Japanese air attacks.\n\n[8] Battle of Preston (1715): The battle of Preston is often claimed to have been the last fought on English soil, but this depends on the definition of \"battle\", for which there are different interpretations. Preston was a siege rather than a pitched battle, so the Battle of Sedgemoor fought in 1685 is also a contender for the title of the last battle, as is the skirmish at Clifton Moor near Penrith in Cumbria on 18 December 1745 during the 'Forty-Five' Jacobite rebellion. However, there was a great deal of savage fighting in streets all over the town during the Battle of Preston, far more than in most sieges. It was as much of a battle as, for example, the Battle of St Albans (1455) in the Wars of the Roses, which was also fought in the streets of a town, but which is generally regarded as a battle and not a siege, as is the Battle of Reading of 1688. The Battle of Bossenden Wood, fought on 31 May 1838, is a much later contender.\n\n[9] Battle of Tiro: The Battle of Tiro was the last battle fought between the Oromo Liberation Army led by Elemo Qiltu, and Ethiopian government forces.\n\n[10] USS Taylor (FFG-50): In September 2010, \"Taylor\" was buzzed by a Russian Tu-95 bomber. However, as of 2004, all significant anti-aircraft capability was deleted from this class. On January 8, 2014, \"Taylor\" left Naval Station Mayport for her last 7-month deployment to the U.S. 5th and 6th Fleets. On February 5, 2014, \"Taylor\" was scheduled to enter the Black Sea along with in support of the Sochi Olympics.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [5].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Adult spruce budworm are medium-sized (15 mm in length) and dichromatic, exhibiting gray and rust colors. The wings have silvery patches and are 21 mm to 30 mm in wingspan. Peak activity occurs during the later afternoon and early evening. After emerging, the adults will mate and lay eggs in July or August.\n\n[2] Choristoneura fumiferana: Eastern spruce budworm moths are strong fliers and disperse in exodus in the evening. They can fly at elevations over 100 meters before going to a new site, which is typically only 50 to 100 kilometers downwind, but can sometimes be up to 450 km away. After depositing some eggs at the first dispersion site, female moths may emigrate and lay eggs at multiple sites. Factors controlling budworm flight during dispersal include meteorological conditions and temperature. Moths will not disperse when the temperature is below 14°C or above 30°C. When the temperature drops below 14°C mid-flight, the moth will fold its wings and descend from the sky.\n\n[3] Spruce budworm: This species is a favoured food of the Cape May warbler, which is therefore closely associated with its host plant, balsam fir. This bird, and the Tennessee and bay-breasted warblers, which also have a preference for budworm, lay more eggs and are more numerous in years of budworm abundance.\n\n[4] Cape May warbler: The breeding habitat of this bird is the edges of coniferous woodland. Cape May warblers nest in dense foliage near the trunk of the tree, commonly a black spruce, and lay 4–9 eggs in a cup nest. This species can lay the largest clutch of any New World warbler, probably in response to increases in the numbers of spruce budworm during outbreaks.\n\n[5] Choristoneura fumiferana: Traditionally, the eastern spruce budworm prefers balsam fir over white spruce. However, one study showed contradicting evidence. In this study, Bichon sampled spruce budworm populations on branches from the upper mid-crowns of dominant or co-dominant balsam fir and white spruce. This was done at 20 randomly selected points in the Black Sturgeon Lake area near Thunder Bay, Ontario. The number of late-instar larvae captured in water traps was recorded throughout the dispersal period of the late instar larvae. The data indicated that white spruce canopies contained 2 to 3 times more spruce budworm than balsam fir canopies. A similar pattern was found in the understory. Water traps under white spruce trees captured more than 3 times as many larvae as did those under balsam fir trees for most of the dispersal period.\n\n[6] Bay-breasted warbler: Their breeding habitats are coniferous woodlands. Bay-breasted warblers nest up in conifer trees, laying 3–5 eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Incubation is 12 days. More eggs are laid in spruce budworm years.\n\n[7] Choristoneura fumiferana: Female moths lay one brood per season, and eggs are laid over several days. The number of eggs per egg mass varies from 1 to about 60, but there are 20 eggs on average per mass. These masses are laid in 2 to 4 rows on conifer foliage, preferably balsam fir and spruce needles. Generally, females can lay 100 to 300 eggs in a lifetime but average approximately 200 eggs. These eggs hatch after around 10 days, but this period ranges from 8 to 12 days. The spruce budworm oviposits on needles of host trees in late June or mid-July to early August. Large numbers of egg masses are deposited on the peripheral shoots of the crown.\n\n[8] Choristoneura fumiferana: The main hosts of the eastern spruce budworm in eastern North America are balsam fir, white spruce, and black spruce, but the larvae feed almost exclusively on current-year needles of balsam fir and white spruce. In massive outbreaks, populations of the insect can become so high that the larvae will feed on old foliage after the current-year foliage has been depleted.\n\n[9] Choristoneura fumiferana: Eastern spruce budworm egg masses are immobile and less vulnerable to predation than other stages of the cycle. Small larvae are exposed to predators during dispersal but become safer while bud or needle mining or overwintering in hibernacula. Large larvae actively escape predation by dropping from the tree foliage, which can also attract the attention of other predators. Predators outside of host plants on the forest floor include ants, spiders, beetles, and small mammals. Pupae are vulnerable because the budworm are generally immobile in this state. The adult moths can fly away from predators but are then exposed to various birds, dragonflies, and robber flies. Spruce budworm male and female moths experience increased vulnerability during copulation.\n\n[10] Choristoneura fumiferana: The eastern spruce budworm \"Choristoneura fumiferana\" has been called “the most destructive forest insect in North America.\" Massive budworm epidemics erupt periodically in spruce–fir forests in northern and eastern Canada. Populations of spruce budworm vary in density over several orders of magnitude. Recorded densities in the boreal forest range from less than 0.01 to over 100 larvae per 45 cm branch tip. Damage to trees in forests can begin even before the buds have flushed. Early instar larvae mine and kill these buds. Late instar larvae are voracious and wasteful feeders, chewing off needles at their bases. In heavy infestations, old foliage is also eaten. Increment loss, tree deformity, and tree mortality follow several years of heavy infestation.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nHow many eggs does the eastern spruce budworm lay?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nReasoning:\nThe answer to the question can be found in context 7.

New York has not had a Hispanic or Latino mayor, with the possible exception of John Purroy Mitchel (1914–1917), who was of Spanish descent and whose grandfather was born in Venezuela. New York's mayors have been religiously diverse; the city has had Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic mayors. No woman has ever served as mayor of New York City.\n\n[2] Mayor of New York City: The Mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter. The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed Grover Whalen as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. Deputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor. (The order of succession is the Public Advocate of the City of New York, then the Comptroller of the City of New York.)\n\n[3] A Mayor's Life: A Mayor's Life: Governing New York's Gorgeous Mosaic is the autobiography of New York City's 106th mayor, David N. Dinkins, co-authored with Peter Knobler. Published in 2013 by PublicAffairs Books, the autobiography recounts the life and career of David Norman Dinkins, who defeated Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani to become mayor of New York. \"The New York Times\" called it a \"moving... inspiring account of New York's first black mayor.\" Set against the backdrop of the rise of Harlem's influence on city politics, which produced several state and national black leaders and energized the base that ultimately led to the election of President Barack Obama, \"A Mayor's Life\" deals with Dinkins' childhood in Trenton, NJ, his service in the U.S. Marine Corps, his education at Howard University and Brooklyn Law School, his political career beginning at the Carver Democratic Club and moving through jobs as City Clerk and Manhattan borough president to his election as mayor. Dinkins discusses his administration's successes, including an historic decrease in the city's crime rate; the cleanup of Times Square; the restoration of dilapidated housing in Northern Harlem, the South Bronx and Brooklyn; the deal to keep the US Tennis Open in New York City, which Mayor Michael Bloomberg has called \"the only good athletic sports stadium deal, not just in New York but in the country\"; and the hosting of Nelson Mandela on the South African diplomat's first international visit after being free\n\n[4] List of mayors of New York City: The Mayor of New York City is the chief executive of New York City's government, as stipulated by New York City's charter. The current mayor, the 109th in the sequence of regular mayors, is Bill de Blasio, a Democrat.\n\n[5] Thomas Noell: Thomas Noell was the 26th Mayor of New York City, who served from 1701 to 1702. He was an English-born merchant from an aristocratic family who became a citizen of New York in 1698. He was appointed mayor on September 29, 1701, and took the oath of office on October 14 of that year. He died in 1702 at his farm in Bergen, New Jersey of smallpox.Notes\n\n[6] Mayor of New York City: The mayor's office is located in New York City Hall; it has jurisdiction over all five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Staten Island and Queens. The mayor appoints a large number of officials, including commissioners who head city departments, and his deputy mayors. The mayor's regulations are compiled in title 43 of the \"New York City Rules\". According to current law, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms in office but may run again after a four year break. It was changed from two to three terms on October 23, 2008, when the New York City Council voted 29–22 in favor of passing the term limit extension into law. However, in 2010, a referendum reverting the limit back to two terms passed overwhelmingly.\n\n[7] Mayor of New York City: The Mayor of the City of New York is head of the executive branch of the Government of New York City. The mayor's office administers all city services, public property, police and fire protection, most public agencies, and enforces all city, state and federal laws within New York City.\n\n[8] Joseph V. McKee: McKee became acting Mayor of New York City after the resignation of Mayor Walker on September 1, 1932. Walker, who resigned amid scandal and the threat of a criminal indictment, subsequently fled to Europe until the danger of prosecution appeared remote. McKee, who was sometimes mockingly referred to as \"Holy Joe\", running as a write-in candidate, lost a special election to John P. O'Brien in November 1932 to fill out the rest of Walker's unexpired term as mayor. His four-month term as acting Mayor of New York City ended on December 31, 1932.\n\n[9] 2009 New York City mayoral election: The 2009 election for Mayor of New York City took place on Tuesday, November 3. The incumbent Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, an independent who left the Republican Party in 2008, won reelection on the Republican and Independence Party/Jobs & Education lines with 50.7% of the vote over the retiring City Comptroller, Bill Thompson, a Democrat (also endorsed by the Working Families Party), who won 46.3%. Thompson had won the Democratic primary election on September 15 with 71% of the vote over City Councilman Tony Avella and Roland Rogers. This was the fifth straight mayoral victory by Republican candidates in New York despite the city's strongly Democratic leaning in national and state elections.\n\n[10] Government of New York City: The government of New York City, headquartered at New York City Hall in Lower Manhattan, is organized under the New York City Charter and provides for a \"strong\" mayor-council system. The mayor is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for the administration of city government. The New York City Council is a unicameral body consisting of 51 members, each elected from a geographic district, normally for four-year terms. All elected officials—other than those elected before 2010, who are limited to three consecutive terms—are subject to a two consecutive-term limit. The court system consists of two city courts and three state courts.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" to the following question:\n\nWho is the current mayor of New York City?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know who the mayor of New York City is?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nReference(s):\n[4] List of mayors of New York City", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.

According to the initial arrangement, the employees which took part in this pension scheme were entitled to receive an early retirement at the age of 66 if they wanted it. Later, the LO and the NHO negotiated on a lower retirement age. This pension scheme retirement age is currently 62. Eighty percent of today's 62-year-olds in Norway are entitled to get this pension scheme. Initially this pension scheme was only meant for those who were working in the hard industrial jobs, but eventually more groups became involved as other trade unions and employers' organizations also joined this pension scheme. The state has gradually joined this scheme.\n\n[2] Pension policy in South Korea: In 2008, Korea introduced the Basic Old-Age Pension. According to the Ministry of Health Welfare and Family Affairs, the Basic Old-age Pension is \"designed to enhance the elderly welfare by providing a monthly pension payment to the elderly in need.\" This pension was meant to benefit workers who were contributing to the National Pension Scheme. By 2012, the pension was only providing 16% of the minimum cost of living, and benefited 67% of Korea's elderly over the age of 65. It was extended in 2014 to allow monthly allowances of approximately $179 (KRW 200,000) to elderly people over the age of 65 in the bottom 70 percentile of income earned. In 2014, approximately 4.9 million people benefited from this program.\n\n[3] Willem Drees: A wide range of social reforms were carried out during's Drees's tenure as Prime Minister. The Occupational Pensions Funds Act of March 1949 made membership of industry-wide pension funds compulsory, while the General Old Age Pensions Act of May 1956 introduced universal flat-rate old age pensions for all residents as a right and with no retirement condition at the age of 65. The Retired Persons' Family Allowances Act of November 1950 established a special allowance for pensioned public servants with children, a law of November 1950 extended compulsory health insurance to cover other groups, such as old-age and invalidity pensioners, and a law of December 1956 introduced health insurance with special low contributions for old-aged pensioners below a certain income ceiling. A law of August 1950 established equal rights for illegitimate children, and introduced an allowance for disabled children between the ages of 16 and 20. The Temporary Family Allowances Act for the Self-employed of June 1951 entitled self-employed persons with low incomes to family allowance for the first and second child, and a law of February 1952 introduced an allowance for studying and for disabled children until the age of 27. In 1950, works councils were established, and in 1957 the dismissal of female civil servants upon marriage was abolished.\n\n[4] First and second terms of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt: The United States was the lone modern industrial country where people faced the Depression without any national system of social security, though a handful of states had poorly-funded old-age insurance programs. The federal government had provided pensions to veterans in the aftermath of the Civil War and other wars, and some states had established voluntary old-age pension systems, but otherwise the United States had little experience with social insurance programs. For most American workers, retirement due to old age was not a realistic option. In the 1930s, physician Francis Townsend galvanized support for his pension proposal, which called for the federal government to issue direct $200-a-month payments to the elderly. Roosevelt was attracted to the general thinking behind Townsend's plan because it would provide for those no longer capable of working while at the same time stimulating demand in the economy and decreasing the supply of labor. In 1934, Roosevelt charged the Committee on Economic Security, chaired by Secretary of Labor Perkins, with developing an old-age pension program, an unemployment insurance system, and a national health care program. The proposal for a national health care system was dropped, but the committee developed an unemployment insurance program largely administered by the states. The committee also developed an old-age plan that, at Roosevelt's insistence, would be funded by individual contributions from workers.\n\n[5] Andrew Fisher: A land tax, aimed at breaking up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while coverage of the Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, the age at which women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.\n\n[6] Pension: A growing challenge for many nations is population ageing. As birth rates drop and life expectancy increases an ever-larger portion of the population is elderly. This leaves fewer workers for each retired person. In many developed countries this means that government and public sector pensions could potentially be a drag on their economies unless pension systems are reformed or taxes are increased. One method of reforming the pension system is to increase the retirement age. Two exceptions are Australia and Canada, where the pension system is forecast to be solvent for the foreseeable future. In Canada, for instance, the annual payments were increased by some 70% in 1998 to achieve this. These two nations also have an advantage from their relative openness to immigration: immigrants tend to be of working age. However, their populations are not growing as fast as the U.S., which supplements a high immigration rate with one of the highest birthrates among Western countries. Thus, the population in the U.S. is not ageing to the extent as those in Europe, Australia, or Canada.\n\n[7] History of the Liberal Party of Canada: As Prime Minister for most of the time between 1921 and 1948, King introduced several measures that led to the creation of Canada's social safety net. Bowing to popular pressure, he introduced the mother's allowance, a monthly payment to all mothers with young children. He also reluctantly introduced old age pensions when J. S. Woodsworth required it in exchange for his Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party's support of King's minority government. Later, Lester B. Pearson introduced universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, and the Canada Assistance Plan (which provided funding for provincial welfare programs).\n\n[8] Glennie Hall: Old-age pensions of per year were introduced by the Queensland government on 1 July 1908 and in September delegates from the various Warwick friendly societies met to discuss the benefits of forming an association. By 31 October 1908 the Warwick and District Friendly Societies Association was founded and office bearers elected. The Commonwealth Government's introduction of the old age pension in 1909 which was soon supplemented by an invalid pension and introduction of the maternity bonus in 1912, was the onset of the welfare state and a death knoll for friendly societies.\n\n[9] Old age: Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to prevent elderly persons from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed. By 1990, the United States was spending 30 per cent of its budget on the elderly, compared with 2 per cent on education. The dominant perception of the American old age population changed from \"needy\" and \"worthy\" to \"powerful\" and \"greedy,\" old people getting more than their share of the nation's resources. However, in 2011, using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the old age American poverty rate was measured as 15.9%.\n\n[10] Welfare in Finland: Finland's first national old-age pension plan dates from 1937, but it was so poorly funded that a new National Pensions Act was put into effect in 1957. In the late 1980s, this law, somewhat reformed, was still the basis of Finland's National Pension Plan, which was open to all residents over the age of sixteen, even to those who had never paid into it. Even those foreigners not from the Nordic countries were entitled to this pension if they had resided in Finland for at least five years. Those who left for residence in a country outside Nordic Europe, even those who were Finnish citizens, could receive the pension for only one year. The flat-rate national pension could be paid as an old-age pension, once a person reached the age of sixtyfive; as an invalidity pension (either full or partial) to those between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four who were no longer able to work; or, in some cases, to the long-term unemployed who were in their late fifties or early sixties. In addition to these classes of beneficiaries, survivors of those eligible for national pensions who were not themselves eligible for the pensions could receive pensions under the terms of the Survivor's Pension Plan. Also tied to the National Pension Plan were payments for handicapped children living at home and for some combat veterans of World War II.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhich country was the first to introduce old age pensions?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

However, Kuala Lumpur's 2013-2016 extended W series plates (Wx #### x) had notably conflicted with the Singapore's W series for engineering plant vehicles and British-sourced 4×4s, Q series for government vehicles, S series for Singapore private vehicles and as such Malaysian vehicles registered in this W, Q and S series may be required to be further identified by their country of origin. Both the tractor and trailer of Malaysian semi-trucks are fitted with the \"Hazardous Cargo\" registrations plates upon entry into Singapore. The same characters of the Malaysian number plates are used, with the only visible changes being the standardised fonts which reflect that of Singapore's and the colour code, which features black characters on an orange background. The \"Hazardous Cargo\" number plates subject Malaysian semi-trailers to the same laws followed by Singaporean ones.\n\n[2] Vehicle registration plates of Portugal: Initially there were white characters on a black background, all of plastic. In 1992, the design was changed to one of black characters on a white background in metal or fibreglass; in that same year, the European blue ribbon was added with the Portuguese 'P' denominator. In 1998, a yellow ribbon on the right side was added with the month and year in which the car was first registered (e.g. 99/12 for December 1999 - the year comes on top of the month). This is different from systems such as in Germany (where the numbers indicate the start and end month of the vehicle's registration) and more similar to systems such as in Italy (where the date indicates the year of vehicle registration). Note that the date is that of first-ever registration of the vehicle, not the date the vehicle was registered in Portugal. Some vehicles carry plates that have a year and month seemingly out of tune with the alphanumeric sequence, and the reason for this is that these are imported used vehicles.Trailers and vehicles for export have the following district code letters in their licence plates:Until the 1970s only the codes A, AN, C, H, L, M and P were used. After that, other registration offices were created with new codes.\n\n[3] Vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom: By 1982, the year suffixes had reached Y and so from 1983 onwards the sequence was reversed again, so that the year letter — starting again at \"A\" — preceded the numbers then the letters of the registration. The available range was then codice_33 to codice_34, the numbers 1–20 being held back for the government's proposed, and later implemented, DVLA select registration sales scheme. Towards the mid-1990s there was some discussion about introducing a unified scheme for Europe, which would also incorporate the country code of origin of the vehicle, but after much debate such a scheme was not adopted because of lack of countries willing to participate.\n\n[4] History of vehicle registration plates of the Philippines: Hyphens were used in separating the numbers; this was later replaced by asterisks in 1938. On the bottom of the license plate are the 2-digit year mark, the place the car is registered, and the word \"P.I.\", in that order (e.g. \"36 MANILA P.I.\", 36 stands for 1936). In 1938 the \"P.I.\" was dropped, the place name and the year mark were simply displayed (e.g. MANILA 60, 60 stands for 1960). Prefixes were common in license plates starting in 1938. Sometimes prefixes stand for place names (e.g. \"PS\" stands for Pasay City).In 1970, Philippine vehicle license plates adapted a numbering format similar to Japanese license plates. It can be in a format of \"DD-DD\", (from 0–0 to 99–99, sometimes 00 to 09 are used) with single or double-letter suffixes. Most vehicle category prefixes are on the lower-left of the plate. For government vehicles, \"RP\" is displayed before the number. Year stickers were introduced in 1973.\n\n[5] Vehicle registration plate: According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, vehicles in cross-border traffic are obliged to display a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. With registration plates in the common EU format, vehicles registered in the EU are no longer required to carry an international code plate or sticker for traveling within the European Economic Area. The common EU format is also recognized in countries signatory to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic. As are registration plates of other European countries similar to the EU format, such as Norwegian ones; with the Norwegian flag replacing the circle of stars. Both the common EU format, and i.e. Norwegian registration plates satisfies the requirements laid out in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic; According to the convention, when the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs.\n\n[6] Vehicle registration plates of Kenya: It is not known when the first vehicle was registered in Kenya, but it is thought to be before 1920. Single letters were attributed to each of the 14 registration districts e.g. N=Kiambu, E=Kisumu, J=Kitale, B, H, T, W=Nairobi, A=Mombasa, C=Nakuru, D=Kericho, F=Eldoret, G=Nyeri, K=Muranga (Fort Hall), L=Kisii, Q=Machakos, S=Lamu, V=Isiolo, Y=Nanyuki. A serial number of 1-9999 followed, on white on black plates, save for commercial vehicles, which are thought to have used black on white.\n\n[7] ISO 3166-1 alpha-3: The United Nations uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for international vehicle registration codes, which are codes used to identify the issuing country of a vehicle registration plate; some of these codes are currently indeterminately reserved in ISO 3166-1.\n\n[8] International vehicle registration code: The country in which a motor vehicle's vehicle registration plate was issued may be indicated by an international licence plate country code, formerly known as an International Registration Letter or International Circulation Mark. The sign must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate, or be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.\n\n[9] Vehicle registration plates of Europe: A metal or plastic plate or plates attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes. The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority's database. In Europe most countries have adopted a common format for number plates, such as the common EU format issued in EU member states. This format satisfies the requirements in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which states that cross-border vehicles must display a distinguishing code for the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle. This sign may be an oval sticker placed separately from the registration plate, or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle, and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state, or the emblem of the regional economic integration organisation to which the country belongs.\n\n[10] Vehicle registration plates of Kazakhstan: The current format of Vehicle registration plates of Kazakhstan uses black letters on a white background with a Kazakh Flag and the country code KZ on the left. The two digit area code is located on the square located on the right and the rest of the plate follows the format 111AAA. This format was introduced in 2011 and was implemented from August 2012. This format of Vehicle registration plates of Kazakhstan used black letters on a white background. Each registration plate consisted of a single letter identifying the area and three digits and two letters identifying the non-individual car (for example: A 001 AA) or of a single letter identifying the area and three digits and three letters identifying the individual car (for example: A 585 CUO)\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease select one of the following options:\n\nYes, answer is present\nI don't know", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if you find the question and any of the contexts contain the answer, or \"I don't know\" if you do not find any answer.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nThe answer is present in context [1] in the following sentence:\n\"A vehicle with the national registration code ‘PK’ would originate from which country?\"\n\nThe answer", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\nNone of the contexts provide information about the country of origin for the vehicle registration code 'PK'.", "Orca-2-7b": "\nYes, answer is present.

His father-in-law, William \"Bowler\" Walsh, played hurling with Cork in the early part of the century. He lined out in two All-Ireland finals in 1912 and 1915, however, he ended up on the losing side on both occasions. Cummins’s sons, Kevin, Ray and Brenadan, all wore the red jersey of Cork at various levels from the 1960s until the 1980s. Kevin captained ‘the Rebels’ to the All-Ireland minor title in 1964. Ray captained the Cork senior team to the first of three All-Ireland titles in-a-row in 1976 while Brendan was also a key member of the team.\n\n[2] Brahe: The Danish branch descended from Axel and what later became the Swedish, descended from Thorkild's daughter, .Johanna Torkildsdotter from the danish Brahe family, married Magnus Laurentsson in Sweden. Their son took his mothers family name Brahe, but not her family arms.\n\n[3] Clan Macdonald of Clanranald: The 'Maceachen' family of Macdonalds descends from Hector, second son of Roderick, 3rd of Clanranald (see 'MacEachan' sept listed below). Hector was granted by the lord of the isles, the lands of Kilmalew and others in the lordship of Morven. The Maceachens of Howbeg and Glenuig descend from Ranald, son of Hector 5th of Kilmalew. Ranald was the first of this family to occupy lands in Uist. A tack was given to the family by Clanranald in the 17th century. In 1900, Angus and Archibald Macdonald state that there were still members of the family using the patronymic in Arisaig and Uist, though the gentlemen of the family assumed the surname Macdonald by the 18th century. The Macdonalds of Morar descend from Allan, eldest son of Dougall, 6th of Clanranald. In 1538, Allan and his brother Lachlan were granted the 14 merklands of Morar.\n\n[4] Simon McTavish: In 1751, Simon McTavish was born at Stratherrick in the Scottish Highlands, the son of John McTavish (1701–1774), tacksman of Garthbeg, who bore the arms of the McTavishes of Garthbeg. His mother, Mary Fraser (1716–1770) of Garthmore, was descended through Simon Fraser of Dunchea and the Frasers of Foyers, from an illegitimate son of the 1st Lord Lovat. McTavish's father had fought as an officer with the Jacobite armies at the Battles of Culloden and Falkirk Muir, and he was one of the few who were specifically named as to \"not\" receive a pardon from George II after the Jacobites were defeated.\n\n[5] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[6] Anthony Caminetti: He married Ellen Martin, a native of California. She descendeded from the distinguished Madison family. Her great-grandmother was President Madison's own cousin. Her great-grandfather, George Holland, was a First Lieutenant in the Continental army, and was with Washington at Valley Forge. His oath of allegiance is on file at the Department of State, being one of the few documents preserved from the destructive hands of the English in the war of 1812. When her husband was unable to be present at the Democratic Convention in Sacramento, Ellen Martin went before the Convention and made his speech of acceptance for him. In commenting on this one of the newspapers of California said: \"People who think that women have no influence in politics ought to have attended the Democratic Convention in Sacramento yesterday. Mrs. Caminetti presided and dictated the course of the proceedings with grace and precision of purpose unexpected from the gentler sex.\" Her work in Washington during a session of the Fifty-third Congress, against a bill that she opposed, elicited a complimentary editorial from a San Francisco paper. Ellen Martin was prominently connected with educational work in California, and was a member of the Board of Education of her county.\n\n[7] Chris Strachwitz: He was born Christian Alexander Maria, Graf Strachwitz von Groß-Zauche und Camminetz, in Gross Reichenau, Lower Silesia, then within Germany and now known as Bogaczów, Poland. His family were aristocratic farm owners, with some American antecedents; Strachwitz's mother's grandfather was US Senator Francis G. Newlands. In 1945, under the terms of the Potsdam Agreement after World War II, he and his family were among the millions of German-speaking people forcibly resettled to the west of the Oder-Neisse line which became the eastern boundary of Germany. Strachwitz's family settled temporarily with relatives in Braunschweig, in the British zone of Allied-occupied Germany, where he first heard swing music played on Armed Forces Radio.\n\n[8] Mancini family: The Sicily line: a) was descended from Giacomo Mancini who moved to Sicily in 1256 to run away at Vitelleschi persecutions; Barons of Tardello, Tumminii and Ogliastro were descended from him. This line was extinguished in the 17th century. b) was descended from Francesco Mancini, consanguineous of the Cardinal Giulio Mazzarino, who moved to Catania in the 17th century as Attorney-General of the Prince Marco Antonio Colonna and his wife Isabella Gioeni. \"Mancini\" family flourished in Catania in the following centuries, so that the Town-Council dedicated streets and squares to Mancini's family. At present the surname of the family is Mancini de Lucij. The Nevers line: was illustrated by many eminent people:\n\n[9] Mecklenburg (Dano-Norwegian family): Mecklenburg, Mechlenborg, and Mikkelborg is a patrician and historically a prominent family living in Denmark and Norway. They descend from Flensburg in today's Germany. Members include Willum Mecklenburg, Feudal Lord of Eiker, as well as several regional bailiffs, militaries, and privileged merchants. The family is closely related to families of the Danish and the Norwegian nobility, and among cognatic descendants of the family are the Counts of Wedel-Jarlsberg.\n\n[10] Massimo family: The Massimo family is sometimes referred to as one of the oldest noble families in Europe. According to the Augustine historian Onofrio Panvinio (1529-1568) in his work \"De gente Maxima\" of 1556, the family descends in the male line from the ancient Gens Fabia or \"Maximi\" of republican Rome and from Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus (c. 275 BC – 203 BC), called \"Cunctator\" (\"the Delayer\"). When asked by Napoleon (with whom he was negotiating the Treaty of Tolentino) whether the family descended from Fabius Maximus, the then Prince Massimo famously replied: «Je ne saurais en effet le prouver, c’est un bruit qui ne court que depuis douze cents ans dans notre famille» (\"I can not actually prove it, it's a rumour that only runs for twelve hundred years in our family\").\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [6].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

During an MTV/MySpace forum on February 19, 2008, Hillary Clinton, when asked about education expenses, stated, \"I'm in favor of two years of national service, where you could earn up to $10,000 a year doing national service and go right into helping you pay for college.\" In a follow-up comment, Barack Obama then stated, \"one of the things that I've proposed, for example, is that I will give a $4000 tuition credit--every student, every year--so that they are not being loaded up with enormous debts, but there will be a community service--a national service component. The military could be one way for you to get this $4000 tuition credit. Another way would be to work in an under-served school that needs help. Another way would be to work in an under-served hospital or a homeless shelter, or a veterans home. The point is, I think it is important for young people to serve.\"\n\n[2] Alexander Dennis Enviro500: As for operators, Community Transit in Snohomish County, Washington currently has a fleet of 62 Enviro500 coaches, including 39 Enviro500 'USA Standard' coaches. After its initial order of 23 Enviro500 coaches proved to be well suited for the agencies commuter routes with direct peak-hour service to Downtown Seattle, the agency placed orders for 17 more Enviro500 'USA Standard' coaches in 2013, 5 more in 2014, and 17 more in 2016. At the same time as Community Transit placed its order, neighboring agency Sound Transit, the regional operator in Seattle, also ordered five Enviro500 'USA Standard' coaches. The agency used the coaches to test their suitability for use Sound Transit Express routes. After proving to be successful, Sound Transit placed an order for an additional 32 Enviro500 'USA Standard' coaches in 2016 which would replace 32 articulated buses loaned from Sound Transit to Community Transit.\n\n[3] Community Transit: Community Transit has a fleet of double-decker buses used on commuter routes from park and rides to Downtown Seattle, named the \"Double Tall\" in reference to the double tall cup size at Starbucks, a coffee chain founded and headquartered in Seattle. The Alexander Dennis Enviro500 was introduced during a one-year pilot project in 2007, on lease from Alexander Dennis for $15,000 per month. The , Enviro500 seated 77 to 81, with standing room for 20 additional passengers, replacing the capacity of the standard articulated buses used on the commuter routes in a smaller footprint. Prior to the end of the trial in 2008, CT placed an order of 23 Enviro500s, scheduled to be delivered and put into service in 2010; the initial order was not fulfilled until 2011, when manufacturing was moved to an ElDorado plant in Riverside, California to meet federal Buy America Act requirements. A second order of 17 Enviro500s, to replace older articulated buses, was made in 2013 and went into service in late 2015.\n\n[4] We Are the World: In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine, and clothing departed for Ethiopia and Sudan. It stopped \"en route\" in New York, where 15,000 T-shirts were added to the cargo. Included in the supplies were high-protein biscuits, high-protein vitamins, medicine, tents, blankets and refrigeration equipment. Harry Belafonte, representing the USA for Africa musicians, visited Sudan in the same month. The trip was his last stop on a four-nation tour of Africa. Tanzanian Prime Minister Salim Ahmed Salim greeted and praised Belafonte, telling him, \"I personally and the people of Tanzania are moved by this tremendous example of human solidarity.\" One year after the release of \"We Are the World\", organizers noted that $44.5 million had been raised for USA for Africa's humanitarian fund. They stated that they were confident that they would reach an initial set target of $50 million (equivalent to $ million in 2022). By October 1986, it was revealed that their $50 million target had been met and exceeded; CBS Records gave USA for Africa a check for $2.5 million, drawing the total amount of money to $51.2 million. USA for Africa's Hands Across America event had also raised a significant amount of money—approximately $24.5 million for the hungry in the US.\n\n[5] School bus: Every year in the United States and Canada, school buses provide an estimated 8 billion student trips from home and school. Each school day in 2015, nearly 484,000 school buses transported 26.9 million children to and from school and school-related activities; over half of the United States K–12 student population is transported by school bus. Outside North America, purpose-built vehicles for student transport are less common. Depending on location, students ride to school on transit buses (on school-only routes), coaches, or a variety of other buses.\n\n[6] South Carolina: South Carolina is the only state which owns and operates its own statewide school bus system. As of December 2016, the state maintains a 5,582 bus fleet with the average vehicle in service being 15 years old with 236,000 miles, compared to the national average of 6 years. Half of the state's school buses are more than 15 years old and some are reportedly up to 30 years old. In 2017 in the budget proposal, Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman requested the state lease to purchase 1,000 buses to replace the most decrepit vehicles. An additional 175 buses could be purchased immediately through the State Treasurer's master lease program. On January 5, 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded South Carolina more than $1.1 million to replace 57 school buses with new cleaner models through its Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program.\n\n[7] Citizen Schools: Citizen Schools has recently partnered with financial institutions such as Bank of America and with technology corporations like Google who have made major financial investments in addition to leading a variety of apprenticeships. In 2008, Bank of America committed $1 million to help support Citizen Schools’ national expansion in addition to providing local grants to support programs in Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina. In California, Bank of America recognized Citizen Schools as a Neighborhood Builder and awarded Citizen Schools $200,000 over two years as part of their Neighborhood Excellence Initiative. Since 2006, Google has taught more than 40 apprenticeships at campuses in California, Massachusetts and New York. At the Brooklyn School for Global Studies, Google programmers provided the first opportunity for middle school students in the United States to work with the Android platform. Google also host WOW! Events and Citizen Schools fundraisers at their corporate offices in Mountain View, California and New York City and provides a Citizen Schools channel on YouTube to showcase their work with students.\n\n[8] Education in the United States: Transporting students to and from school is a major concern for most school districts. School buses provide the largest mass transit program in the country, 8.8 billion trips per year. Non-school transit buses give 5.2 billion trips annually. 440,000 yellow school buses carry over 24 million students to and from schools. In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that forced busing of students may be ordered to achieve racial desegregation. This ruling resulted in a white flight from the inner cities which largely diluted the intent of the order. This flight had other, non-educational ramifications as well. Integration took place in most schools though de facto segregation often determined the composition of the student body. By the 1990s, most areas of the country had been released from mandatory busing.\n\n[9] Foreign relations of Nepal: Currently, 36 intermediate and large projects such as construction of a National Police Academy at Panauti, Nepal Bharat Maitri Pashupati Dharmashala at Tilganga, a Polytechnic at Hetauda, and the National Trauma Centre at Kathmandu are at various stages of implementation. In addition, Government of India's Small Development Projects (SDPs) programme in Nepal extends assistance for the implementation of projects costing less than NRs 5 crore (approx.. INR 3.125 crore) in critical sectors such as health, education & community infrastructure development. So far, 243 SDPs have been completed and 233 are under various stages of implementation in 75 districts of Nepal, with a total outlay of over Rs 550 crore. Till date, India has gifted 502 ambulances and 98 school buses to various institutions and health posts across Nepal's 75 districts.\n\n[10] General Services Administration: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (stimulus bill) included $300 million to acquire energy-efficient motor vehicles for the federal fleet. President Barack Obama announced that GSA was to support the U.S. auto industry with orders for about 17,600 new fuel-efficient vehicles by June 1, 2009, on an accelerated schedule, with money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. GSA was to pay $285 million to General Motors Corporation, Chrysler LLC, and Ford Motor Company. It was to include 2,500 hybrid sedans—the largest one–time purchase yet of hybrid vehicles for the federal government—and each new vehicle was claimed to yield at least a 10% fuel economy improvement over its predecessor. GSA was to spend $15 million more that year on a pilot fleet of advanced-technology vehicles, including all-electric vehicles and hybrid buses.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [7].\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Winters are usually milder than much of the rest of the state due to Missoula's location west of the Rockies, allowing it to receive mild, moist Pacific air and avoid the worst of cold snaps; however, it also gets more precipitation in winter. Winter snowfall averages , on average occurring between October 30 and April 20. As with the rest of the state, summers are very sunny, and the average diurnal temperature variation is more than from late June through late September, due to the relative aridity. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in December to in July. There is an average of 24 days with temperatures above , 45 days where the temperature does not rise above freezing, and 7.8 days with temperatures below .\n\n[2] Climate of Mumbai: The mean average is 27.2 °C and average precipitation is 242.2 cm (95.35 inches). The mean maximum average temperatures is about in summer and in winter, while the average minimums are in summer and in winter. Mumbai experiences three distinct seasons: 1. Winter (Nov to Feb or mid March) winter temperature 15 to 20 degree C Peak Winter Months - Dec to Mid Feb with temperature range 12-19 Deg C; 2. Summer (Feb/March to mid June and Sept to Nov) Avg temperature 30 to 27 Deg. C; Peak Summer Months (Mid March to June 1 week), temperature shoots up to 30 - 40 Deg. C with humidity being approx 70-80%. 3.Monsoon: (June to August, at times until October). Peak monsoon months: July & August sometimes with winds and thunderstorms. Temperatures at 24-29 Deg C.\n\n[3] Coachella Valley: The area is surrounded on the southwest by the Santa Rosa Mountains, by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west, the Little San Bernardino Mountains to the east and San Gorgonio Mountain to the north. These mountains peak at around and tend to average between 5,000 and 7,000 feet (1,500 to 2,000 m). Elevations on the Valley floor range from 1600 ft above sea level at the north end of the Valley to 250 ft below sea level around Mecca. In the summer months daytime temperatures range from to and nighttime lows from to . During winter, the daytime temperatures range from to and corresponding nights range from to making it a popular winter resort destination. The surrounding mountains create Thermal Belts in the immediate foothills of the Coachella Valley, leading to higher night-time temperatures in the winter months, and lower daytime temps during the summer months. Due to its warm year-round climate the region's agricultural sector produces fruits such as mangoes, figs and dates.\n\n[4] Mecca, California: Situated within the Colorado Desert, Mecca's climate is that of an arid desert, which experiences an average 90 degree temperature. Low temperatures can reach into the 20s. The community sits at less than 150 feet below sea level on the edge of the Salton Sea, formerly the Salton Sink.\n\n[5] Folsom, New Mexico: Folsom’s elevation moderates summer temperatures. July is the warmest month with an average high temperature of 84 (28C) degrees and an average low of 56 (13C). January is the coldest month with an average high temperature of 45 (7C) and an average low of 17 (-8C). The highest recorded temperature is 99 (37C) degrees and the lowest was minus 28 (-33C). Folsom receives 18 inches (45mm) of precipitation per year, mostly as summer rainfall but with about 30 (76mm) inches of snow annually. July and August are the wettest months and January and February are the driest.\n\n[6] Mecca: Mecca features a hot desert climate. Like most Saudi Arabian cities, Mecca retains warm to hot temperatures even in winter, which can range from at night to in the afternoon. Summer temperatures are extremely hot and consistently break the mark in the afternoon, dropping to in the evening. Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts scattered between November and January. Mecca houses Al-Haram Mosque, the largest mosque in the world. The mosque surrounds the Kaaba, which Muslims turn towards while offering daily prayer. This mosque is also commonly known as the \"Ḥaram\" or \"Grand Mosque\".\n\n[7] Meshchera Lowlands: Climate of Meshchera is humid continental with long, cold and snowy winters, and short, warm and rainy summers. Annual average temperature is . The coldest month is February with average temperature of . During severe winters, temperatures can go as low as . Summers are warm, sometimes hot, with average July temperature of , and in extremely hot summers temperature can rise up to .\n\n[8] Climate of Mecca: Mecca features a hot desert climate. Mecca retains its hot temperature in winter, which can range from at night to in the day. Summer temperatures are extremely hot, often being over during the day, dropping to at night. Rain usually falls in Mecca in small amounts between November and January. The rainfall, as scant as it is, also presents the threat of flooding and has been a danger since the earliest times. According to Al-Kurdī, there had been 89 historic floods by 1965, including several in the period. In the last century the most severe one occurred in 1942. Since then, dams have been constructed to ameliorate the problem.\n\n[9] Geography of Massachusetts: Generally, Massachusetts' hilly central interior (e.g. Worcester) and its western Berkshire Mountain region (e.g. Pittsfield) have colder winters than its coastal and Connecticut River Valley regions. Stockbridge, in the Berkshires, has a January average temperature of 21.6 °F (-5.8 °C). In Eastern Massachusetts, Boston, on the coast of Massachusetts Bay, has an average January temperature of 29.0 °F (-1.7 °C). The island of Martha's Vineyard has the state's highest average temperature—31.8 °F (-0.1 C), due to the warming effect of the Atlantic Ocean. Summer temperatures are highest in the state's urban centers, due to the heat island effect. Average July temperatures in Massachusetts' three most populous urban centers are: Boston (coastal) - 81.7 °F (27.6 °C); Worcester (central) - 79.2 °F (26.2 °C); and Springfield (Connecticut River Valley) - 85.0 °F (29.44 °C). By contrast, the coolest average summer temperatures occur in the Berkshires and on the state's offshore islands. The average temperature in August, the warmest month on Nantucket Island, is 68.7 °F (20.4 °C). The average in July in Stockbridge is 68.9 °F (20.5 °C). Both daily and seasonal variation in temperature are greatest in the Berkshires and lowest along the coast.\n\n[10] Climate of Mecca: Mecca is at an elevation of 277 m above sea level, and approximately 80 km inland from the Red Sea. Flash floods are common during winter season even though the amount of precipitation is low. Since Mecca is located in a desert, dust storms are common in the city.Since Mecca is located in a low-lying region, it is threatened by seasonal flash floods despite the low amount of annual precipitation. There are less than of rainfall during the year, mainly falling in the winter months. Temperatures are high throughout the year and in summer it may reach .

He started his football career as an amateur with his hometown team Finchley, in the London League. In May 1929 he signed for Aston Villa. His chances were limited at Villa Park, and he signed for Burnley during the 1935–36 season where he developed into an inside right earning the nickname \"The Toff\" because of his gentlemanly approach to life and football.\n\n[2] Burnley Express: The newspaper was founded as the Burnley Express and East Lancashire Observer by printer George Frankland from Preston as an eight-page penny weekly. It was politically Conservative. In 1880, it merged with the \"Burnley Advertiser\", becoming the Burnley Express and Advertiser, and in 1886, it became the Burnley Express and Clitheroe Division Advertiser.\n\n[3] Australian cricket team in Australia in 1962–63: With their baseball experience Australia were traditionally a stronger fielding side than England and as Richie Benaud emphasised this area of the game their already athletic skills rose to an extraordinary level. Wally Grout was an exceptional wicket-keeper, but had his jaw broken while keeping to Queensland's West Indian fast-bowler Wes Hall in their match against the MCC a week before the Test. He was replaced by South Australia's Barry Jarman, who played only seven Tests until Grout retired in 1966, when he became Australia's first-choice keeper and vice-captain on their 1968 tour of England. Neil Harvey and Norm O'Neill were electric in the covers, and Harvey took six catches in his last Test. Bobby Simpson held 110 catches in 62 Tests and was \"one of the greatest slip-fielders of all time. He had lightning-quick reflexes and it was rare indeed for a chance to go begging if the ball was anything like catchable.\" Alan Davidson's spectacular catching close to the wicket earned him the nickname of \"The Claw\" and Benaud himself was an expert gully.\n\n[4] Ryan Ciminelli: Ryan Ciminelli (born March 7, 1986) is a left-handed ten-pin bowler from Cheektowaga, New York. Since 2007, he has competed on the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. Ciminelli has won seven PBA Tour titles, including one major championship, in addition to 12 PBA Regional titles. He has earned over $590,000 on Tour to date, and has rolled 11 perfect 300 games in PBA competition. Ryan is a staff member of Motiv Bowling and Turbo Grips. He was given the nickname \"The Ryan Express\" in the 2012 Tournament of Champions TV introductions, while his DV8 bio listed the nickname \"Hit Man\".\n\n[5] Bart Crashley: Bart Crashley (born June 15, 1946 in Toronto, Ontario) is a retired professional ice hockey defenceman who played 148 games in the National Hockey League and 140 games in the World Hockey Association. He played for the Detroit Red Wings, Los Angeles Sharks, Kansas City Scouts, and Los Angeles Kings. Wore contact lenses when he played. A promising rushing defenceman in his rookie year of 1967–68 with Detroit where he wore jersey #15 and was paired with Gary Bergman. His style of play was not encouraged by coach Sid Abel who reportedly instructed Crashley to not carry the puck past his own blueline. Subsequently traded to Montreal where he played in their farm system. Drafted by the New York Islanders in 1972 expansion draft, but opted to join Los Angeles Sharks of the WHA. Joined the Kansas City Scouts in 1974 for their first NHL season, wearing #4. Returned to Detroit via a trade halfway through that season where he again wore #4. Went to the Los Angeles Kings along with Marcel Dionne in a blockbuster trade. Assistant Coach of the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey League 1998–99. Coach of the Couchiching Terriers (Ontario Provincial Junior A) 2007–2008. Coach of the Campbellford Rebels Ontario Empire B Junior C Hockey League 2012–13.\n\n[6] The Midnight Express (professional wrestling): When Bobby Eaton was sent to Mid-South Wrestling under promoter Bill Watts as a part of a talent trade it was decided that he should be part of the new version of the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of Jim Cornette to form a new version of the Midnight Express. The Express had up until this point been a group of wrestlers, but once Eaton and Condrey joined together the Midnight Express worked exclusively as a two-man team. To complement \"Loverboy\" Dennis Condrey, Eaton was nicknamed \"Beautiful Bobby\", a nickname he still uses. The Express was first booked in a storyline with the Mid-South Tag Team champions Magnum T.A. and Mr. Wrestling II. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey tarring and feathering Magnum TA in the middle of the ring. Condrey and Eaton won their first tag team championship when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum TA and attacked him during a match, allowing The Midnight Express to walk away with the titles without much opposition. Collectively Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton hold the record for the most Tag Team Titles in all of professional wrestling with 51 together; earning the right to be called the most decorated Tag Team of all time. See Title History below.\n\n[7] Burnley Express: The Burnley Express is a newspaper for Burnley and Padiham, England and surrounding area. It is printed twice weekly on Tuesday and Friday, which is the larger edition. In print since 1877, it is now part of the Johnston Press group. The \"Padiham Express\" is a variant with the first few pages being specific to Padiham. Much of the content is also available on the paper's website.\n\n[8] C. Aubrey Smith: As a cricketer, Smith was primarily a right arm fast bowler, though he was also a useful right-hand lower-order batsman and a good slip fielder. He is widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to play the game. His oddly curved bowling run-up, which started from deep mid-off, earned him the nickname \"Round the Corner Smith\". When he bowled round the wicket his approach was concealed from the batsman by the umpire until he emerged, leading W. G. Grace to comment \"it is rather startling when he suddenly appears at the bowling crease.\" He played for Cambridge University (1882–85) and for Sussex at various times from 1882 to 1892. While in South Africa he captained the Johannesburg English XI. He captained England to victory in his only Test match, against South Africa at Port Elizabeth in 1888–89, taking five wickets for nineteen runs in the first innings. The English team who played were by no means representative of the best players of the time and nobody at the time realised that the match would enter the cricket records as an official Test match.\n\n[9] Hedley Verity: Verity was unsuccessful during the 1927 season, his only one with Accrington. His bowling was less effective than the club had hoped; he endured spells where he took few wickets and was unable to implement the tactics or bowl in the style that the club expected. His batting average for the season was 5.25. The team, containing players far more experienced than Verity, were unimpressed by his performances and unsympathetic to his difficulties, offering him little support in the field. Even so, the club were prepared to offer an improved contract for 1928, but he declined as Accrington had previously refused to release their players for county cricket. Verity signed a contract with Middleton, a club in the Central Lancashire Cricket League. Limited in resources, the club paid him less than Accrington, but guaranteed his release to play for Yorkshire if he were selected. Playing with young teammates, Verity worked hard to coach the players and develop team spirit. He made a modest start in his first season, and was initially rated as a useful but unimpressive all-rounder. A visit to the Yorkshire nets around this time prompted Verity to alter his bowling style. Wilfred Rhodes, Yorkshire's main spinner since 1898, was considering retirement; he and Hirst suggested that, as there were fewer spinners than medium-pace bowlers, Verity was more likely to achieve selection if he switched to spin bowling. With the support of the Middleton team and \n\n[10] Billy Baxter (footballer): He was a regular in the Ipswich team than won the old Division 2 Championship in 1960-61 and Division 1 Championship in 1961-62. He later captained the team to the old Division 2 Championship in 1967-68. In total, Baxter played 459 games for Ipswich during an 11-year stay at Portman Road. However, after a falling-out with manager Bobby Robson, he was sold to Hull City in March 1971. This was an unfortunate end to a fine career with Ipswich as Baxter, who had played initially as a wing-half and later as a centre back was a consistent and loyal member of the squad for many years.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhich England bowler earned the nickname \"The Burnley Express\"?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, the England bowler who earned the nickname \"The Burnley Express\" is Bob Brocklebank.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context 3.\n\nIn context 3, the answer is mentioned as \"The Claw\" which is a nickname given to Alan Davidson, an Australian cricketer, for his spectacular catch", "flan-t5-xxl": "No, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\nThere is no context that answers the question about which England bowler earned the nickname ’The Burnley Express’.

They both have a year of 365 days, which is extended to 366 once every four years, without exception, so have a mean year of 365.25 days. As solar calendars became more accurate, they evolved into two types.\n\n[2] Runic calendar: The calendar is based on the 19-year-long Metonic cycle, correlating the Sun and the Moon. Runic calendars were written on parchment or carved onto staves of wood, bone, or horn. The oldest one known, and the only one from the Middle Ages, is the Nyköping staff from Sweden, believed to date from the 13th century. Most of the several thousand which survive are wooden calendars dating from the 16th and the 17th centuries. During the 18th century, the Runic calendars had a renaissance, and around 1800, such calendars were made in the form of tobacco boxes in brass.\n\n[3] Tzolk'in: The 260-day calendar spread throughout the Mesoamerican cultural region and is regarded as the oldest and most important of the calendar systems, with an origin predating its first appearances in Maya inscriptions. The earliest evidence of this calendar comes from a possible day sign with a dot numeral coefficient in an Olmec-like inscription in Oxtotitlán cave dated to 800-500 BCE. Some of the next oldest calendric inscriptions are from early strata of Zapotec in the Oaxacan highlands at sites such as Monte Albán, dating from mid-1st millennium BCE. A few earlier-dated inscriptions and artifacts have what appear to be calendric glyphs, such as at San José Mogote and in the Olmec Gulf Coast region. However, either the dating method or the calendric nature of the glyphs are disputed by scholars.\n\n[4] Chiapas: Recent excavations in the Soconusco region of the state indicate that the oldest civilization to appear in what is now modern Chiapas is that of the Mokaya, which were cultivating corn and living in houses as early as 1500 BCE, making them one of the oldest in Mesoamerica. There is speculation that these were the forefathers of the Olmec, migrating across the Grijalva Valley and onto the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico to the north, which was Olmec territory. One of these people's ancient cities is now the archeological site of Chiapa de Corzo, in which was found the oldest calendar known on a piece of ceramic with a date of 36 BCE. This is three hundred years before the Mayans developed their calendar. The descendants of Mokaya are the Mixe-Zoque.\n\n[5] Celtic calendar: The Gaulish Coligny calendar is possibly the oldest Celtic solar/lunar ritual calendar. It was discovered in Coligny, France, and is now on display in the Palais des Arts Gallo-Roman museum, Lyon. It dates from the end of the second century AD, when the Roman Empire imposed the use of the Julian Calendar in Roman Gaul. The calendar is made up of bronze fragments, in a single huge plate. It is inscribed in Gaulish with Latin characters and uses Roman numerals.\n\n[6] History of calendars: A mesolithic arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in Warren Field, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, dated to roughly 10,000 years ago, has been described as a lunar calendar and was dubbed the \"world's oldest known calendar\" in 2013.\n\n[7] Vučedol culture: Among the most famous pieces is a vessel bearing inscribed images corresponding to what has been alleged to be the oldest Indo-European calendar, based on an Orion cycle, shown by precise sequence of constellations on a vessel found in an Eneolithic mound in the very center of the modern town of Vinkovci. The climatic conditions in that latitude bring about four yearly seasons. The simple explanation of the Vučedol Calendar is that each of the four lateral bands on the vessel represent the four seasons, starting with spring on the top. Each band is divided into twelve boxes, making up 12 \"weeks\" for each season. Each of the little boxes contains an ideogram of celestial objects that lie at a certain point on the horizon right after twilight. The place of reference on the horizon is the point at which (in those days) the Orion's Belt disappeared from view at the end of winter, which meant the beginning of a new year. The pictographs in the boxes represent: Orion, the Sun, Cassiopeia, Cygnus, Gemini, Pegasus, and the Pleiades. If the box is empty, it means there was nothing visible at the reference point during the corresponding time.\n\n[8] Zoroastrian calendar: The oldest (though not dateable) testimony for the existence of the day dedications comes from \"Yasna\" 16, a section of the Yasna liturgy that is – for the most part – a veneration to the 30 divinities with day-name dedications. The \"Siroza\" – a two-part Avesta text with individual dedications to the 30 calendar divinities – has the same sequence.\n\n[9] History of calendars: The Oldest European calendar is found near to Vukovar in modern-day Croatia. It is a ceramic vessel bearing inscribed ideograms of celestial objects.\n\n[10] History of calendars: A ceramic artefact from Bulgaria, known as the Slatino furnace model, has been pronounced by local archeologists and media to be the oldest known calendar representation, a claim not endorsed in mainstream views.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [3].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nI don't know in context [2].\nYes, answer is present in context [3].\nI don't know in context [4].\nYes, answer is present in", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "\n[Based on the given contexts, it is unclear which, if any, of them contains the answer to the question about the oldest type of calendar.

His invention is essentially the same now as it was 140 years ago. Only with self-propelled torpedoes could the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war. Until the perfection of the guided torpedo, multiple \"straight-running\" torpedoes were required to attack a target. With at most 20 to 25 torpedoes stored on board, the number of attacks was limited. To increase combat endurance most World War I submarines functioned as submersible gunboats, using their deck guns against unarmed targets, and diving to escape and engage enemy warships. The importance of guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser such as the French and the Royal Navy's and M-class submarines. With the arrival of Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, guns became more for defense than attack. A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube, loaded only in port. The ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as minelayers. Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose. Modern submarine-laid mines, such as the British Mark 5 Stonefish and Mark 6 Sea Urchin, can be deployed from a submarine's torpedo tubes.\n\n[2] Submarine warfare: The age of submarine warfare began during the American Civil War. The 1860s was a time of many turning points in terms of how naval warfare was fought. Many new types of warships were being developed for use in the United States and Confederate States Navies. Submarine watercraft were among the newly created vessels. The first sinking of an enemy ship by a submarine occurred on 17 February 1864, when the Confederate submarine , a privateer sank the sloop in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Shortly afterward, however, \"H. L. Hunley\" sank, with the loss of her entire crew of eight.\n\n[3] Submarine warfare: All participants were supposed to abide by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, but this was found to be impracticable for submarines. The German government maintained the British naval blockade was illegal under international law. Initially, German submarines did attempt to comply with the prize rules, but later switched to unrestricted submarine warfare following the British introduction of Q-ships with concealed deck guns. American diplomatic pressure forced the Germans to stop this for a while, but in January 1917 Germany declared a war zone around the British Isles and sank up to a quarter of shipping entering it, until escorted convoys were introduced.\n\n[4] Anti-submarine mortar: Anti-submarine warfare did not become an issue of great concern until World War I, when Germany used submarines in an attempt to strangle British shipping in the Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere. The earliest way to counter a submarine was in the form of depth charges, which were large canisters filled with explosives, rolled off the back of a ship and detonated by a hydrostatic fuse. Depth charges served well throughout World War I but were not without flaws. A ship had to pass directly over a submarine to score an effective hit, because of this depth charges were dropped in lines instead of more effective clusters and could only be carried in ships fast enough to avoid the concussion of the explosion. The depth charges were also not as effective as one might think at sinking a submarine - only a very close detonation would sink a submarine, and the problems of scoring a direct hit meant that a submarine was more often damaged then destroyed by depth charges.\n\n[5] History of the United States Navy: Submarines were the \"silent service\"—in terms of operating characteristics and the closed-mouth preferences of the submariners. Strategists had, however, been looking into this new type of warship, influenced in large part by Germany's nearly successful U-boat campaign. As early as 1912, Lieutenant Chester Nimitz had argued for long-range submarines to accompany the fleet to scout the enemy's location. The new head of the Submarine Section in 1919 was Captain Thomas Hart, who argued that submarines could win the next war: \"There is no quicker or more effective method of defeating Japan than the cutting of her sea communications.\" However Hart was astonished to discover how backward American submarines were compared to captured German U-boats, and how unready they were for their mission. The public supported submarines for their coastal protection mission; they would presumably intercept enemy fleets approaching San Francisco or New York. The Navy realized it was a mission that isolationists in Congress would fund, but it was not actually serious. Old-line admirals said the mission of the subs ought to be as eyes of the battle fleet, and as assistants in battle. That was unfeasible since even on the surface submarines could not move faster than 20 knots, far slower than the 30 knot main warships. The young commanders were organized into a \"Submarine Officers' Conference\" in 1926. They argued the\n\n[6] Sonobuoy: With the technological improvement of the submarine in modern warfare, the need for an effective tracking system was born. Sound Navigation And Ranging (SONAR) was originally developed by the British—who called it ASDIC—in the waning days of World War I. At the time the only way to detect submarines was by listening for them (passive sonar), or visually by chance when they were on the surface recharging their battery banks. Air patrols (the British mostly used small airships which had the advantage of long endurance) could spot surfaced submarines and occasionally, when conditions were right, even submerged ones as the diving depth of submarines of the era was so limited. If contact was made, they would follow the submarine while summoning surface ships by radio to attack it.\n\n[7] Sea: Submarines became important in naval warfare in World War I, when German submarines, known as U-boats, sank nearly 5,000 Allied merchant ships, including however the RMS Lusitania, so helping to bring the United States into the war. In World War II, almost 3,000 Allied ships were sunk by U-boats attempting to block the flow of supplies to Britain, but the Allies broke the blockade in the Battle of the Atlantic, which lasted the whole length of the war, sinking 783 U-boats. Since 1960, several nations have maintained fleets of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, vessels equipped to launch ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads from under the sea. Some of these are kept permanently on patrol.\n\n[8] Submarines in the United States Navy: Given the lack of large scale conventional naval warfare since 1945, with the USN's role being primarily that of power projection, the submarine service did not fire weapons in anger for very many years. The BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) was developed to give naval vessels a long range land attack capability other than direct shore bombardment and strikes by aircraft flying off carriers. Submarines fitted with the Tomahawk could hit targets up to 1,000 miles inland. The mainstay of the Tomahawk equipped vessels in the early days of the missile's deployment were the s, and the submarine fleet. The Tomahawk was first used in combat on 17 January 1991, on the opening night of Operation Desert Storm. On that day, for the first time since the surrender of Japan in 1945, an American submarine fired in combat, when 12 Tomahawks were launched by U.S. boats in the eastern Mediterranean. Since then, the Tomahawk has become a staple of American campaigns, seeing use in three wars. It has also been exported to the United Kingdom, which has also fitted it to submarines. The use of the Tomahawk has seen a change in the design of attack submarines. The Tomahawk can be fired through 21-inch torpedo tubes, but the and s since have been fitted with vertical launch systems to enable them to carry more of the weapons.\n\n[9] History of submarines: Germany started the war with only 65 submarines, with 21 at sea when war broke out. Germany soon built the largest submarine fleet during World War II. Due to the Treaty of Versailles limiting the surface navy, the rebuilding of the German surface forces had only begun in earnest a year before the outbreak of World War II. Having no hope of defeating the vastly superior Royal Navy decisively in a surface battle, the German High Command planned on fighting a campaign of \"Guerre de course\" (Merchant warfare), and immediately stopped all construction on capital surface ships, save the nearly completed s and two cruisers, and switched the resources to submarines, which could be built more quickly. Though it took most of 1940 to expand production facilities and to start mass production, more than a thousand submarines were built by the end of the war.\n\n[10] Submarine warfare: The advent of the nuclear-powered submarine in the 1950s brought about a major change in strategic thinking about submarine warfare. These boats could operate faster, deeper and had much longer endurance. They could be larger and so became missile launching platforms. In response to this the attack submarine became more important, particularly in regard to its postulated role as a hunter-killer. The US also used nuclear submarines as radar pickets for a while. There have also been major advances in sensors and weapons.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [7], [9]", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It is endemic to the Solomon Islands. The population abundance has been marked by periodic die-offs of generally unknown cause, including a major die-off in the 1980s. Hunting may be a significant threat to the population.\n\n[2] Nǃxau ǂToma: On 5 July 2003, he died from multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis while he was out on an excursion for hunting guinea fowl. According to official estimates he was about 58 or 59 years old at the time. He was buried on 12 July in a semi-traditional ceremony at Tsumkwe, next to the grave of his second wife. He had six surviving children.\n\n[3] Winfield Toll Bridge: Winfield Toll Bridge, also known as the Ross Booth Memorial Bridge, is a historic three-span cantilever Warren Truss bridge located at Winfield and Red House, Putnam County, West Virginia. It was built in 1955, and spans the Kanawha River, carrying West Virginia Route 34. The cantilever through-truss consists of two anchor spans each 245 feet in length and the main span 462 feet in length between pier center lines. The main span consists of two 128 feet, 4 inch, cantilever arms and a 205 feet, 4 inch, suspended span.\n\n[4] Solomon, King of Hungary: Solomon did not give up his ambitions even after his abdication. He was arrested for plotting against his cousin, then held in captivity in Visegrád. He was released \"on the occasion of the canonization of King St. Stephen and the blessed Emeric the confessor\" around 17 August 1083. According to Hartvik's \"Legend of King Saint Stephen\", King Ladislaus ordered Solomon's release, because nobody could open the grave of the saintly king while Solomon was held in captivity.\n\n[5] List of The Blacklist characters: While being transported by federal agents, Solomon is rescued by an unknown person driving a Rolls Royce. Then, working for Susan Hargrave, he plots to steal a nuclear weapon. This plot turns out to be a decoy to divert the FBI's attention from his real mission: capturing Liz Keen. He and his men surround the church where Liz and Tom are about to be married and demand that Liz come with them or they will kill everyone else and take her by force. However, Reddington, Tom, and the task force members are able to fend off Solomon's men long enough for Ressler to come to the rescue, allowing Liz and Tom to escape. He chases Liz again after her escape and hunts her ambulance as Red tries to take her to the hospital to save her life. Solomon is able to disable Red's vehicle and pins him and his men down. Eventually FBI backup arrives and Solomon flees as his men are killed. However, the delay in getting to the hospital caused by Solomon's attack causes Liz to apparently die due to complications during childbirth.\n\n[6] Swift's silver mine: Solomon Mullins, or \"Money-making Sol\" (born 1782, died 1858) was rumored to have discovered Swift's mines near Pine Mountain in Southwest Virginia. Solomon lived in what was then known as Holly Creek, but is now Clintwood, Virginia. Solomon melted the silver down and used one of his slaves to \"strike\" for him (striking: the head of a hammer is heated until it is a plastic state and struck over a good coin. The coin, being harder than the softened head of the hammer is, therefore, imprinted. The hammer is then allowed to cool thus producing the die). To finish the process, or to imprint the counterfeit coins with official markings, Sol and his slave would relocate to the privacy afforded by caves located on cliffs adjacent Sol's farm. To this day, the cliffs are known as \"Sol's Cliffs.\"\n\n[7] Peggy Solomon: Solomon was the daughter of Etta (née Wedell) and Jules Mastbaum, a Philadelphia real estate investor who specialized in movie theaters and the philanthropist whose estate established that city's Rodin Museum. Both parents played bridge. In 1930 she married Benjamin M. Golder, who was a U.S. Congressman from Philadelphia (1925–1933); he would be 1946 president of the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) and die in office. Peggy Golder started bridge lessons \"shortly before World War II\". Charles Goren was her second teacher and Charles J. Solomon, another star player from Philadelphia became her mentor; they married in 1948. Charles Solomon would be president of the ACBL in 1958, the year the World Bridge Federation was established, and second president of the WBF (1964–68). He died in 1975.\n\n[8] Abdelghani Bousta: From May 1973 to September 1974, Abdelghani Bousta lived in hiding. During this time, he realised the mistakes made when the March 1973 events were organised. In 1975, he wrote a critical analysis of UNFP on behalf of the Option Révolutionnaire (Revolutionary option) movement, harshly criticising the events and the leaders: “[...] the March 1973 events helped shed light on the internal contradictions of the Party and show the true nature of its leaders: putschist and adventurous leaders who did not see any problem in sacrificing dozens of activists in a hazardous battle.”\n\n[9] Tensta Konsthall: Recent exhibitions at Tensta konsthall include • “Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies,” with Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Goldin+Senneby, Wade Guyton, Mai-Thu Perret, Walid Raad, and Haegue Yang, among others • “Kami, Khokha, Bert and Ernie: World Heritage” by Hinrich Sachs • “Doing what you want: Marie-Louise Ekman accompanied by Sister Corita Kent, Mladen Stilinović, and Martha Wilson” • “The Society without qualities” with Sören Andreasen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Sture Johannesson, Sharon Lockhardt, and Palle Nielsen (part of “The new model” and curated by Lars Bang Larsen) • “Working With...” by Zak Kyes • “We are continuing BBDG” with Bernd Krauss • “Two Archives” by Babak Afrassiabi and Nasrin Tabatabai\n\n[10] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H.

It was built in 1899, and designed by local architect and parish member Louis G. Destremps, who also designed the nearby St. Joseph's Orphanage and Notre Dame de Lourdes Church.\n\n[2] St. Joseph's Church (Fall River, Massachusetts): Right Reverend Bishop Hendricken presided over the lengthy ceremonial of dedication, and this was followed by a Solemn High Mass with these officers: Celebrant, Reverend Father James F. Roach of Taunton; Deacon, Reverend Father Michael P. Cassidy of Fall River; Sub-Deacon, Reverend Father Patrick McLaughlin of Woonsocket, R.I.; Master of Ceremonies, Reverend Father Michael O'Hare of Fall River. The sermon was by Reverend Father R.J. Barry of Hyde Park, who spoke in English and French from the text: \"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel.\" After paying deserved tribute to the three clergymen who had initiated, carried on and finished the erection of the noble building, he entered into an explanation of the meaning conveyed to the faithful in the dedication of a church and of the great power for good it would be in the community. A score of priests were in the sanctuary, and the congregation that filled every seat in the edifice followed his words with a rare degree of interest.\n\n[3] St. Joseph's Church (Fall River, Massachusetts): The ceiling and sides are frescoed in panels and show a very neat effect. The sanctuary is fitted up with rare beauty and taste. Running almost the entire width of the church, the sanctuary has a smaller altar at either side, dedicated to Saint Joseph, the patron saint, and to the Blessed Virgin Mary. These have just been under the skilled hands of decorators, and, like the main altar, painted in white and gold, are more resplendent than at any time since the day of their construction. A handsome new carpet on the floor of the sanctuary, green in color with red trimmings, adds the last detail to the beauteous ensemble.\n\n[4] St. Joseph's Church (Fall River, Massachusetts): The end came on Ash Wednesday, February 18, l885, and the last words that he gave utterance to were these: \"I'm tired; I want to go home!\" On the Friday of that week, February 20, the funeral ceremonies were held with the first religious service in the new church, the officers of the Solemn High Mass of Requiem being: Celebrant, Reverend Father McCabe of Fall River; Deacon, Reverend Father Roach of Taunton; Sub-Deacon, Reverend Father Grace of Fall River; Master of Ceremonies, Reverend Father Briscoe of Fall River. The eulogy was ably delivered by Reverend Father Kinnerney of Pawtucket, R.I., with the absolution and the final blessing by the head of the diocese, Right Reverend Bishop Hendricken. As in the death of the founder of the parish, the body of Reverend Father Brady was laid at rest in a vault in the basement of the church.\n\n[5] St. Joseph's Orphanage (Fall River, Massachusetts): St. Joseph's Orphanage is an historic former orphanage and school located at 56 St. Joseph Street in Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\n[6] Jesus Marie Convent (Fall River, Massachusetts): The Jesus Marie Convent is a historic former convent located at 138 St. Joseph's Street in Fall River, Massachusetts. It was built in 1887 and designed by local architect and parish member Louis G. Destremps, who also designed the nearby orphanage, school and church.\n\n[7] St. Mary's Cathedral and Rectory (Fall River, Massachusetts): The church and the entire steeple are stonework (save for the gilded cross at its 190-foot high apex), with a shingled roof. The interior includes intricate woodwork, with some gilding above the sanctuary. It is attached to the rectory, chapels and diocesan offices to the rear by a colonnade. The cathedral is one of several grand Catholic churches built in the city during its heyday as an industrial center, including St. Anne Shrine, the Good Shepherd Church (formerly Saint Patrick's), Sacred Heart Church, Espirito Santo, and Saint Joseph's Church, as well as several that have since been lost, including St. Matthieu's in the North End (taken by eminent domain in the 1960s) and Notre Dame de Lourdes in the Flint, which was destroyed in one of the city's most famous conflagrations on May 11, 1982.\n\n[8] St. Joseph's Church (Fall River, Massachusetts): St. Joseph's Church is a historic church located at 1355 North Main Street in Fall River, Massachusetts. It was built in 1880 in the Gothic Revival style and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It was designed by notable church architect Patrick C. Keely.\n\n[9] St. Joseph's Church, Le Havre: The church was designed by the chief architect for the reconstruction of Le Havre, Perret, who was the teacher and mentor to the Swiss architect Le Corbusier. A centrally-planned building, Saint Joseph's Church was envisioned as a beacon for the city. The church’s single, central tower dominates the city skyline, easily visible from the city’s port. Perret’s vision created a building resembling a lantern, now fondly referred to as the “lantern tower” or the “lighthouse at the heart of the city.” Made of concrete, St Joseph’s is a product of modern architectural innovation in Post-War France. The sombre interior is in the Neo-Gothic style. The tower is 107 metres tall and acts as a beacon visible from out at sea, especially at night when illuminated.\n\n[10] St. Joseph's Orphanage (Fall River, Massachusetts): In 1989, the building was converted into residential apartments, with a large addition to the north side. A statue of Saint Joseph was removed from the alcove atop the front of the building and placed on the nearby grounds of Notre Dame Church.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [3].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the height of St. Joseph's Church in Fall River?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nI don't know in contexts [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], and [10].", "flan-t5-xxl": "No, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

In Europe, the most commonly used currency is the euro (used by 25 countries); any country entering the European Union (EU) is expected to join the eurozone when they meet the five convergence criteria. Denmark is the only EU member which has been granted an exemption from using the euro, Sweden has also not adopted the Euro, although unlike Denmark, it has not formally opted out, instead, fails to meet the ERM II (Exchange Rate Mechanism) which results in the non-use of the Euro. For countries which hope to join the eurozone, there are five guidelines that need to be followed, grouped in the Maastricht criteria.\n\n[2] Bulgaria and the euro: While Bulgaria has not formally joined the exchange rate mechanism, the ±15% floating band permitted within ERM II is less restrictive than Bulgaria's current strict peg of 1.95583 BGN to 1 EUR. The lev has been pegged to the euro since its launch, and prior to that was pegged on par to the German Mark. While the currency board which pegs Bulgaria to the euro has been seen as beneficial to the country fulfilling criteria so quickly, the ECB has pressured Bulgaria to drop it as it did not know how to let a country using a currency board join the euro. The Prime Minister has stated the desire to keep the currency board until the euro was adopted. However, factors such as a high inflation, an unrealistic exchange rate with the euro and the country's low productivity are negatively affected by the system.\n\n[3] Euro: Outside the eurozone, a total of 22 countries and territories that do not belong to the EU have currencies that are directly pegged to the euro including 14 countries in mainland Africa (CFA franc), two African island countries (Comorian franc and Cape Verdean escudo), three French Pacific territories (CFP franc) and three Balkan countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark), Bulgaria (Bulgarian lev) and Macedonia (Macedonian denar). On 28 July 2009, São Tomé and Príncipe signed an agreement with Portugal which will eventually tie its currency to the euro. Additionally, the Moroccan dirham is tied to a basket of currencies, including the euro and the US dollar, with the euro given the highest weighting.\n\n[4] Lithuania and the euro: All members of the European Union, except Denmark and the UK, are required by treaty to join the euro once certain economic criteria have been met. The Lithuanian litas participated in ERM II since 28 June 2004, and was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.45280 litai = €1. Lithuania originally set 1 January 2007 as their target date for joining the euro, and in March 2006 requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the currency. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met four of the five criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that \"there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation.\" Lithuania is the only country initially to have been denied approval to adopt the euro after requesting a convergence check.\n\n[5] European Union: In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining. In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.\n\n[6] European Currency Unit: On 1 January 1999, the euro (with the code EUR and symbol €) replaced the ECU, at the value €1 = 1 ECU. Unlike the ECU, the euro is a real currency, although not all member states participate (for details on euro membership see Eurozone). Two of the countries in the ECU basket of currencies, UK and Denmark, did not join the eurozone, and a third, Greece, joined late. On the other hand, Finland and Austria joined the eurozone from the beginning although their currencies were not part of the ECU basket (since they had joined the EU in 1995, two years after the ECU composition was \"frozen\")\n\n[7] Sweden and the euro: Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and its accession treaty has since obliged it to adopt the euro once the country is found to comply with all the convergence criteria. However, one of the requirements for eurozone membership is two years' membership of ERM II, and Sweden has chosen not to join this mechanism, which would peg the Swedish currency to the euro ±2.25%. The SEK floats freely alongside other currencies. Most of Sweden's major parties believe that it would be in the national interest to join, but they have all pledged to abide by the result of the referendum.\n\n[8] Enlargement of the eurozone: The eurozone was born with its first 11 Member States on 1 January 1999. The first enlargement of the eurozone, to Greece, took place on 1 January 2001, one year before the euro had physically entered into circulation. Along with the formal eurozone states, the euro also replaced currencies in four microstates, Kosovo and Montenegro who all used the currencies of one of the member countries. Denmark and Sweden held referendums on joining the euro, but both referendums were lost leading both to remain outside. The first enlargements after the euro entered circulation were to states which joined the EU in 2004; namely Slovenia in 2007, followed by seven others up to 2015. The chart below provides a full historical summary of exchange-rate regimes for EU members since the European Monetary System with its Exchange Rate Mechanism and the related new common currency ECU was born on 13 March 1979. The euro replaced the ECU 1:1 at the exchange rate markets, on 1 January 1999. During 1979–1999, the German mark functioned as a de facto anchor for the ECU, meaning there was only a minor difference between pegging a currency against ECU and pegging it against the German mark. All members who joined the union from 1995 onwards are required by treaty to adopt the euro as soon as they meet the criteria; only Denmark and the United Kingdom obtained treaty opt-outs from participation in the Maastricht Treaty when the euro was agreed upon.

Greece joined 1 January 2001, one year before the physical euro coins and notes replaced the old national currencies in the eurozone. Subsequently, the following seven countries also joined the eurozone on 1 January in the mentioned year: Slovenia (2007), Cyprus (2008), Malta (2008), Slovakia (2009), Estonia (2011), Latvia (2014) and Lithuania (2015).\n\n[10] 2000s (decade): A common currency for most EU member states, the euro, was established electronically in 1999, officially tying all the currencies of each participating nation to each other. The new currency was put into circulation in 2002 and the old currencies were phased out. Only three countries of the then 15 member states decided not to join the euro (the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden). In 2004 the EU undertook a major eastward enlargement, admitting 10 new member states (eight of which were former communist states). Two more, Bulgaria and Romania, joined in 2007, establishing a union of 27 nations.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhich country is joining the euro currency in 2023?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Which country is joining the euro currency in 2023?\n\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if you see the country you are looking for in the provided contexts, or \"I don't know\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\nThe country joining the euro currency in 2023 is Bulgaria.", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

However, without the same degree of popular support, they were less effective. By late 1922, the Irish National Army had taken all the major towns in the country and reduced the IRA's campaign to small scale attacks. A very large number of anti-Treaty fighters, some 12,000 in all, were interned by the Free State. Moreover, as it went on the war produced acts of great cruelty on both sides. The Free State embarked on a policy of selective executions – 77 prisoners were judicially shot with over 100 more 'unofficially' killed in the field. The anti-Treaty forces assassinated one pro-Treaty member of Parliament, and several other civilian politicians, wounded more and burned their houses. However the Free State's tactics of internment and executions combined to cripple the anti-Treaty forces by April 1923.\n\n[2] History of guerrilla warfare: In 1462, the Ottomans were driven back by Wallachian prince Vlad III Dracula. Vlad was unable to stop the Turks from entering Wallachia, so he resorted to guerrilla war, constantly organizing small attacks and ambushes on the Turks. During The Deluge in Poland guerrilla tactics were applied. In the 100 years war between England and France, commander Bertrand du Guesclin used guerrilla tactics to pester the English invaders. The Frisian warlord and freedom fighter Pier Gerlofs Donia fought a guerrilla against Philip I of Castile and with his co-commander Wijerd Jelckama against Charles V.\n\n[3] Arthur Ehrhardt: Ehrhardt re-enlisted in the Wehrmacht when war broke out in 1939 and initially served with the Abwehr. At his own request he was transferred to the Waffen-SS in 1944 and worked as a member of Heinrich Himmler's staff. Within the SS he rose to rank of Sturmbannführer (Major), becoming an expert in anti-espionage tactics in the Balkans. He also wrote extensively on the subject of guerrilla warfare, notably in such books as \"Kleinkrieg\". This work has been edited by the Command and General Staff School of the United States Army in Fort Leavenworth, KA in 1936 under the title: \"Guerrilla Warfare. Lessons of the Past and Possibilities of the Future\". However, his insights into the possibility of unusual tactics being used by and against partisans were largely ignored by the Wehrmacht high command. He also served as the expert in 'Bandenbekämpfung' in the Führer Headquarters.\n\n[4] History of guerrilla warfare: Although many of the engagements of the American Revolution were conventional, guerrilla warfare was used to a certain extent during this conflict from 1775–1783, which made a significant impact. Guerrilla tactics were first used at the Battles of Lexington and Concord by the Patriots at April 19, 1775. George Washington sometimes used some sort of unconventional methods to fight the British. During the Forage War, George Washington sent militia units with limited Continental Army support to launch raids and ambushes on British detachments and forage parties, the militia, and Continental Army support would skirmish with British detachments in small-scale battles and engagements. Throughout the Forage War, British casualties exceeded past 900. The Forage War raised morale for the Patriots as their guerrilla operations against the British were very effective. Next, there are other Americans that used hit and run raids, ambushes, and surprise attacks against the British such as William R. Davie, David Wooster, Francis Marion, Shadrach Inman, Daniel Morgan, Morgan's riflemen, and the Overmountain Men. All these American guerrilla fighters did their part by using unconventional tactics to fight the British and loyalists. Nathanael Greene used a guerrilla strategy very effectively against Lord Cornwallis. First, Nathanael Greene would keep retreating to lure the British far from their supply lines, then send out\n\n[5] The Terrorists of Iraq: Nance asserts that the United States did not adequately learn from the past mistakes of the Vietnam War and the 1920 uprising by the people of Iraq against the United Kingdom forces. He notes these events could have imparted valuable pointers to the Bush Administration such as the notion that terrorism tactics used by insurgency operations including guerrilla warfare were difficult to defeat effectively, even in the face of overwhelming U.S. military forces. Nance recounts lessons learned from the Lebanon war with Israel in 1992, particularly how the subsequent occupation of Lebanon by Israel could have provided the U.S. with significant ways to improve their strategy in the Iraqi invasion in 2003. Nance compares the two occupation force strategies, and argues each left their occupiers with many deaths and few tangible results.\n\n[6] History of guerrilla warfare: Many guerrilla tactics are used by the Iraqi insurgency against the U.S.-led coalition. Such tactics include the bombing of vehicles and human targets, suicide bombings, ambushes, sniper attacks, and traditional hit and run raids. Although it is unclear how many U.S. casualties can be attributed to insurgent guerrilla action because of the high numbers of non-combat related injuries and deaths being included in all available statistics of total coalition casualties, it is estimated that they have injured more than 18,000 coalition troops and killed over 3,900, including more than 3,000 U.S. soldiers. In addition the Sunni insurgents established de facto control over the Al Anbar Governorate and Diyala Governorate, over a third of Iraq's land. Insurgent control was maintained despite a series of coalition campaigns; the worsening violence in Baghdad led to the recall of coalition forces, ensuring continued insurgent control.\n\n[7] History of guerrilla warfare: Guerrilla tactics were employed in the war in the Pacific as well. When Japanese forces invaded the island of Timor on 20 February 1942, they were resisted by a small, under-equipped force of Allied military personnel— known as Sparrow Force—predominantly from Australia, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands East Indies. Although Portugal was not a combatant, many East Timorese civilians and some Portuguese colonists fought with the Allies as guerrillas (\"criados\"), or provided food, shelter and other assistance. Some Timorese continued a resistance campaign following the Australian withdrawal. When the United States entered the war, the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) co-operated and enhanced the work of SOE as well as working on its own initiatives in the Far East. Colonel Wendell Fertig in 1942 organized a large guerrilla force which harassed the Japanese occupation forces on the Philippine Island of Mindanao all the way up to the liberation of the Philippines in 1945. After the surrender of Bataan and Corregidor which was the last organized resistance against the Imperial Japanese Army, Filipino guerillas fought the Japanese throughout the war and became a very important force during the liberation of the Philippines. The exploits of these American commanders and Filipino guerillas influenced the later formation of the United States Green Berets.\n\n[8] Strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare: In Iraq, most of the deaths since the 2003 US invasion have not been suffered by US troops but by civilians, as warring factions plunged the country into civil war based on ethnic and religious hostilities. (\"See also: Civil war in Iraq (2006–07)\") Arguments vary on whether such turmoil will succeed in turning American opinion against the US troop deployment. However, the use of attacks against civilians to create an atmosphere of chaos (and thus political advantage where the atmosphere causes foreign occupiers to withdraw or offer concessions), is well established in guerrilla and national liberation struggles. Claims and counterclaims of the morality of such attacks, or whether guerrillas should be classified as \"terrorists\" or \"freedom fighters\" are beyond the scope of this article. See Terrorism and Genocide for a more in-depth discussion of the moral and ethical implications of targeting civilians.\n\n[9] Strategy and tactics of guerrilla warfare: The VC and NVA made extensive use of such international sanctuaries during their conflict, and the complex of trails, way-stations and bases snaking through Laos and Cambodia, the famous Ho Chi Minh Trail, was the logistical lifeline that sustained their forces in the South. Also, the United States funded a revolution in Colombia in order to take the territory they needed to build the Panama Canal. Another case in point is the Mukti Bahini guerrilleros who fought alongside the Indian Army in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 against Pakistan that resulted in the creation of the state of Bangladesh. In the post-Vietnam era, the Al Qaeda organization also made effective use of remote territories, such as Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, to plan and execute its operations.\n\n[10] History of guerrilla warfare: Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army split into pro- and anti-Treaty factions with the Anti-Treaty IRA forces losing the Irish Civil War (1922–23) which followed. The partition of Ireland laid the seeds for the later Troubles. The Irish Civil War is a striking example of the failure of guerrilla tactics when used against a relatively popular native regime. Following their failure to hold fixed positions against an Irish Free State offensive in the summer of 1922, the IRA re-formed \"flying columns\" and attempted to use the same tactics they had successfully used against the British. However, against Irish troops, who knew them and the terrain and faced with the hostility of the Roman Catholic Church and the majority of Irish nationalist opinion, they were unable to sustain their campaign. In addition, the Free State government, confident of its legitimacy among the Irish population, sometimes used more ruthless and effective measures of repression than the British had felt able to employ. Whereas the British executed 14 IRA men in 1919–1922, the Free State executed 77 anti-treaty prisoners officially and its troops killed another 150 prisoners or so in the field (see Executions during the Irish Civil War). The Free State also interned 12,000 republicans, compared with the British figure of 4,500. The last anti-Treaty guerrillas abandoned their military campaign \n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question with a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\":\n\nDid the USA use guerrilla tactics against England?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

On 11–12 September, \"Seydlitz\" and the rest of the I Scouting Group covered a minefield laying operation off Terschelling. On 24 November, the ship ran aground in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, but was quickly refloated. On 4 December, while exiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, \"Seydlitz\" became entangled in one of the net barriers. Divers had to remove the tangled nets from the starboard screws.\n\n[2] SMS Seydlitz: \"Seydlitz\" was long at the waterline, and overall. The ship had a beam of , which was increased to with anti-torpedo nets equipped. She had a draft of forward and aft. \"Seydlitz\" displaced as designed, and carrying a full load, the ship displaced . \"Seydlitz\" had a double bottom for 76 percent of the length of the hull. The ship carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, three barges, two launches, two yawls, and two dinghies. \"Seydlitz\" was described as having been a good sea boat with gentle motion. The ship lost up to 60 percent of her speed at a hard rudder, and would heel over to 9 degrees. The ship had a standard complement of 43 officers and 1025 men, and when serving as the flagship of I Scouting Group , she was manned by an additional 13 officers and 62 men.\n\n[3] SMS Moltke: By 14:00, Boedicker's ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling. At 15:38, \"Seydlitz\" struck a naval mine, which tore a 50-foot (15 m) hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, allowing 1,400 short tons (1,250 long tons) of water to enter the ship. \"Seydlitz\" turned back, with the screen of light cruisers, at a speed of . The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, \"Seydlitz\" was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Boedicker to disembark. The torpedo boat brought Boedicker to \"Lützow\".\n\n[4] SMS Seydlitz: SMS \"Seydlitz\" was a battlecruiser of the Imperial German Navy, built in Hamburg. She was ordered in 1910 and commissioned in May 1913, the fourth battlecruiser built for the High Seas Fleet. She was named after Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, a Prussian general during the reign of King Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War. \"Seydlitz\" represented the culmination of the first generation of German battlecruisers, which had started with the in 1906 and continued with the pair of s ordered in 1907 and 1908. \"Seydlitz\" featured several incremental improvements over the preceding designs, including a redesigned propulsion system and an improved armor layout. The ship was also significantly larger than her predecessors—at , she was approximately 3,000 metric tons heavier than the \"Moltke\"-class ships.\n\n[5] SMS Seydlitz: On the night of 30 May 1916, \"Seydlitz\" and the other four battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group lay in anchor in the Jade roadstead. The following morning, at 02:00 CET, the ships slowly steamed out towards the Skagerrak at a speed of . By this time, Hipper had transferred his flag from \"Seydlitz\" to the newer battlecruiser \"Lützow\". \"Seydlitz\" took her place in the center of the line, to the rear of \"Derfflinger\" and ahead of \"Moltke\". The II Scouting Group, consisting of the light cruisers , Boedicker's flagship, , , and , and 30 torpedo boats of the II, VI, and IX Flotillas, accompanied Hipper's battlecruisers.\n\n[6] SMS Seydlitz: On 15 June 1916, repair work to \"Seydlitz\" began in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, and continued until 1 October. The ship then underwent individual training, and rejoined the fleet in November. With his previous flagship \"Lützow\" at the bottom of the North Sea, Hipper again raised his flag in \"Seydlitz\". On 4 November, \"Seydlitz\" and \"Moltke\", along with the II Division, I Battle Squadron, the III Battle Squadron, and the new battleship sailed to Bovbjerg on the Danish coast, in order to retrieve the stranded U-boats and .\n\n[7] SMS Derfflinger: By 14:00, Boedicker's ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling.

The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, \"Seydlitz\" was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Boedicker to disembark. The torpedo boat brought Boedicker to \"Lützow\", and the operation continued as planned. After Boedicker departed the ship, \"Seydlitz\", escorted by a pair of torpedo boats, withdrew southward to the Jade. She was out of service for over a month for repair work due to the mine damage.\n\n[9] SMS Seydlitz: At 00:45, \"Seydlitz\" was attempting to thread her way through the British fleet, but was sighted by the dreadnought and noted as a \"ship or Destroyer\". \"Agincourt\"s captain did not want to risk giving away his ship's position, and so allowed her to pass. By 01:12, \"Seydlitz\" had managed to slip through the British fleet, and she was able to head for the safety of Horns Reef. At approximately 03:40, she scraped over Horns Reef. Both of the ship's gyro-compasses had failed, so the light cruiser \"Pillau\" was sent to guide the ship home. By 15:30 on 1 June, \"Seydlitz\" was in critical condition; the bow was nearly completely submerged, and the only buoyancy that remained in the forward section of the ship was the broadside torpedo room. Preparations were being made to evacuate the wounded crew when a pair of pump steamers arrived on the scene. The ships were able to stabilize \"Seydlitz\"s flooding, and the ship managed to limp back to port. She reached the outer Jade river on the morning of 2 June, and on 3 June the ship entered Entrance III of the Wilhelmshaven Lock. At most, \"Seydlitz\" had been flooded by of water.\n\n[10] SMS Seydlitz: On 3 August 1915, \"Seydlitz\", \"Moltke\", and \"Von der Tann\" were transferred to the Baltic with I Reconnaissance Group (AG) to participate in a planned foray into the Riga Gulf. The intention was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, including the pre-dreadnought , and to use the minelayer to block the entrance to Moon Sound with naval mines. The German forces, under the command of Hipper, included the four and four s, the battlecruisers \"Seydlitz\", \"Moltke\", and \"Von der Tann\", and a number of smaller craft.

Historically the Germanic tribes created fighting groups of 100 men. This term is not used in the modern German military (although it is roughly the size of a company, which is a bit larger). It is currently used by the \"Bereitschaftspolizei\" (riot police) of the \"Landespolizei\" (state police) and \"German Federal Police\" to designate company-sized police reserve units.\n\n[2] Hundred (county division): A hundred is an administrative division that is geographically part of a larger region. It was formerly used in England, Wales, some parts of the United States, Denmark, Southern Schleswig, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Norway. It is still used in other places, including South Australia, and The Northern Territory.\n\n[3] Ten Thousand Villages: Prices are determined by a combination of what the artisan believes fair and demand in the foreign market. Artisans are paid up-front fifty percent of the agreed-upon price in order to help them pay for the raw materials used in their products. The other fifty percent is paid once the products are complete. The artisans are paid in full before their products are sold in North America, even if they never get sold. Ten Thousand Villages’ marketing director Doug Dirks estimated that market prices abroad are up to five times what is paid to the artisan. He said that his company is willing to take that risk because they feel that it is important to what they do. Most of the artisans in these countries cannot obtain business loans from their local banks.\n\n[4] Council of Two Hundred: The Councils of Two Hundred (\"Rat der Zweihundert\" or \"Conseil des Deux-Cents\") were the legislative authorities in four Swiss cities (Zürich, Bern, Fribourg, Basel), as well as in the independent Republic of Geneva, prior to the French Revolution. They were medieval in origin, although the council in Geneva dates to 1526. They sometimes contained as many as 300 members.\n\n[5] Twenty Two Hundred: Twenty Two Hundred is an Australian rock band from Melbourne, Victoria, who formed in 2010. The band was founded by songwriter, musician and producer Mark Wells (former member of The Ronnie Wood Band). Their music incorporates elements of hard rock, classic rock, funk and groove.\n\n[6] 1000 percent: \"1000 percent\" or \"1000%\" in a literal sense means to multiply by 10. This article deals with its use in American English as a metaphor meaning very high emphasis, or enthusiastic support. It was used in the 1972 U.S. presidential election by presidential candidate George McGovern who endorsed his running mate, Thomas Eagleton , \"1000 percent\" following a scandal, then soon after dropped him. Communication experts Judith Trent and Jimmy Trent agree with journalist Theodore H. White who called it, \"possibly the most damaging single faux pas ever made by a presidential candidate.\"\n\n[7] The Hundred (cricket): The Hundred is the working title of a proposed professional 100-ball cricket league in England and Wales run by the ECB from 2020. The league will consist of eight city-based franchise teams, each of which will field both a men's and women's team. It is intended to run alongside the county-based t20 Blast for men and supersede the Women's Super League.\n\n[8] Hundred Million: \"Hundred Million\" is a song by Canadian rock band Treble Charger. It was released as the lead single from the band's fourth album, \"Detox\". The song features backing vocals by Deryck Whibley and percussion by Steve Jocz, both from Sum 41. The song received a CASBY Award for \"Favourite New Single\" in 2002.\n\n[9] Atlantic Northeast: New England economy shows continuous growth in the second quarter of 2016.

The manufacturing nationally decreased from two thousand fifteen to two thousand and sixteen but the New England area had a nice increase.\n\n[10] Percent sign: The percent (per cent) sign (%) is the symbol used to indicate a percentage, a number or ratio as a fraction of 100. Related signs include the permille (per thousand) sign ‰ and the permyriad (per ten thousand) sign ‱ (also known as a basis point), which indicate that a number is divided by one thousand or ten thousand respectively.

The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating).

Under the Constitution of South Korea, the president is the country's head of state as well as its head of government. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n[2] List of Presidents of South Korea: The Great Korean Republic (대한공화국) was proclaimed in Seoul on April 23, 1919, by 24 representativse gathered from 13 provinces of Korea. It is commonly known as the Seoul Government (한성정부). Syngman Rhee was elected by the assembled representatives as the Consul-President (집정관 총재). Rhee sent letters to foreign heads of state including those of the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom notifying these countries of the proclamation of the Republic and his election as the President. It was agreed at the time of the amalgamation with the Governments of Shanghai and Vladivostok that the new unified Provisional Government is the successor government of the legitimacy of the Seoul Government.\n\n[3] President of South Korea: The President of the Republic of Korea () is, according to the South Korean constitution, the chairperson of the cabinet, the chief executive of the government, commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and the head of state of South Korea. The Constitution and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding two governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election. If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. While in office, the chief executive lives in Cheong Wa Dae (the \"Blue House\"), and is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason).\n\n[4] Political scandals in South Korea: Koreagate is the name of a political bribery scandal revealed in 1976. It involves the Central Intelligence Agency South Korea (KCIA), Korean political figures and several U. S. congressmen. In 1971, U. S. President Richard Nixon announced his intention to withdraw U. S. troops from South Korea. The President of the Republic of Korea, Park Chung-hee, disagreed with Nixon's decision to withdraw soldiers from South Korea and felt that it was urgent to obtain support to preserve the remaining military presence of the United States. In 1976, KCIA spent millions of dollars to finance a project called Intrepid. The purpose of this program was to bring both President Nixon back on his decision and to ease the growing tensions between the two countries.\n\n[5] Coup d'état of May Seventeenth: On October 26, 1979, the former president of South Korea of the time, Park Chung-hee, was assassinated by the leader of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA). Following the death of the former president, South Korea entered a state of transition. Times prior to the death of Park Chung-hee, was void of democracy and South Korea was an autocratic state. After the assassination, a revision to change South Korea into a nation of democracy was attempted to be implemented. Choi Kyu-hah, who was the prime minister of the time, became the successor of Park Chung-hee and was appointed the role of acting president. With Choi Kyu-ha in power, restricting regulations of the rule of Park Chung-hee were repealed and opposition leaders and activists, such as Kim Dae-jung, were freed from restraint. Choi Kyu-ha later became the official president of South Korea on December 6, 1979. Despite the attempt to change South Korea from an autocratic state to a democratic nation, the already established ideals stemming from the Yushin Constitution, such as martial law and dictatorial rule, was failed to be abolished and an authoritarian rule of the military remained.\n\n[6] 2018 North Korea–United States summit: Donald Trump was elected US President in 2016 with a position of opposition to Barack Obama's policy of \"strategic patience\" towards North Korea. While advocating a tough stance, he also expressed openness to dialogue, saying he would be prepared to \"eat a hamburger\" with Kim. He put himself at odds with military allies, saying that it would be better if South Korea and Japan protect themselves. In return, a pro-North Korean website, DPRK Today, described him as a \"wise politician\". The editorial suggested that Trump might make the slogan \"Yankee go home\" a reality. In 2017, Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy of friendly relations with the North. North Korea successfully tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), named Hwasong-14, in July 2017. In response to heightened North Korean rhetoric, Trump warned that any North Korean attack \"will be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before\". In response, North Korea announced that it was considering a missile test in which the missiles would land near the US territory of Guam. North Korea tested what some sources argued may have been its first hydrogen bomb on September 3. The test was internationally condemned, and further economic sanctions were put on North Korea. The United States also added North Korea back to its State Sponsor\n\n[7] Sukhee Kang: Kang was born at Yeji-dong near Jongno 5-ga in Seoul, South Korea, to merchant parents from the city of Kaesong, in what is now North Korea. He served military draft duty in the Republic of Korea Army from 1973-75 and immigrated to the United States in June 1977 from South Korea after receiving his bachelor's degree in agricultural economics from Korea University in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul. When he was in a college, he joined the English debating club named Seoul PTC (Pine Tree Club) and served as the president from 1971-72. He received an honorary doctoral degree in Business Administration from Dongseo University in Busan, South Korea in March 2011.\n\n[8] Park Geun-hye: Park Geun-hye (; ; born 2 February 1952) is a former South Korean politician who served as the 18th President of South Korea from 2013 to 2017. Park was the first woman to be President of South Korea and also the first female president popularly elected as head of state in East Asia. She was also the first South Korean president to be born after the country's founding; her predecessors were either born during Japanese rule or during the post-World War II transitional period.\n\n[9] History of South Korea: Park Geun-hye was inaugurated in February 2013. She was the eighteenth President of South Korea and is the eldest child of South Korea's third President, Park Chung-hee. She was the first woman to be elected South Korean president, but was impeached in December 2016, because a of series of scandals which led to her impeachment. She was the first woman to be elected as a head of state in the modern history of Northeast Asia. However, after a corruption scandal involving Choi Soon-sil quickly blew up after reports from multiple news organizations (the most notable of which was JTBC) in 2016, nationwide protests ensued on a weekly basis, with participant count hitting a maximum of over 2.3 million (as reported by the protesters). These protests turned out to be the biggest series of mass protests in Korean history. The protests continued even after the Congress voted on Park's impeachment. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn acted as President of South Korea pending completion of investigations into the actions of Park Geun-hye, and in the absence of any intervening election. The impeachment was upheld by the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017, ending Park's presidency and forcing her out of office.\n\n[10] Lai Đại Hàn: A June 16, 2016, article in the \"Daily Kos\" said that South Korea has been \"\"very vocal\"\" about the agony Koreans endured from Japan during World War II, pressing for apology and compensation from Japanese prime ministers at different points in time for what Japan did to South Korea during World War II, and the article described this as being done \"ironically\" in light of what the South Korean military did to other countries' civilians. The article said that \"\"brutal killings, rapes and heinous acts\"\" done by the South Korean military during the Vietnam War have now been unearthed. Referring to South Korea's actions during the Vietnam War, the article said that South Korean president Park Geun-hye should admit to the \"\"historical truths of her country's detestable behavior \"\", and the article said that president Park should be \"like Japan\" and give an apology and compensation to the victims of what the South Korean military did during the Vietnam War.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the name of the president of South Korea?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, the answer is present.

INDRA is a series of joint exerise with Russian special forces, and operation Sampriti is the name for joint exercises with Bangladeshi special forces. Para (SF) also conducts exercises and training with the special forces of Israel. The Ajeya Warrior is a series of exercises with regular infantry units of the UK (as the UK's special forces are highly classified). Indian special forces also conduct exercises with forces of the following 16 friendly countries: the United States, France, the UK, Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Maldives, Seychelles, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand.\n\n[2] 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment: Training evenings (Tuesday night, Wednesday for Nottingham) will usually include a combination of fitness, military skills and admin. One or two weekend exercises per months of ranges, tactics, military skills etc. (9 weekends maximum) before TSC Alpha. Advanced skills in TSC Bravo takes place before P Company and Parachute training. Annual camps (one per year, 2 weeks duration) are for longer exercises, parachuting and more advanced range work.Recent overseas annual camps have been held in the Czech Republic 1999 (Ex Czech Mate); France 2001 (Ex Gaulish 1); Germany 2002 (Ex Paperchase); Ukraine 2003 (Ex Cossack Steppe); Wyoming, USA 2005 (Ex Stoney Run) and Albania 2006. In addition the Battalion has a number of regular exercises and unit exchanges in which it takes part, including Ex Paperchase (exchange with German 272 Fallschirmjager Battalion); Ex Anthropoid (Patrol competition with Slovak Special Forces); Ex Pathfinder (Exchange with Czech airborne forces) and Ex Market-Garden (annual commemoration and jump into Arnhem). The Battalion also regularly sends teams to the annual Exercise Cambrian Patrol competition held at the Sennybridge Training Area.\n\n[3] Kazakhstan–United States relations: The second phase of the Steppe Eagle 2015 peacekeeping exercises began June 15, 2015 at the Ili training area near Almaty. It was the 13th time the exercise was held. Annually, exercises involved more than 1,500 people as well as military observers from foreign states, experts from various NATO headquarters and military-diplomatic corps accredited in Kazakhstan.\n\n[4] Bangladesh–India relations: On 9 October 2011, Indian and Bangladeshi armies participated in Sampriti-II (Unity-II), a 14-day-long Joint military exercise at Sylhet to increase synergy between their forces.\n\n[5] Cadex 2009: Cadex 2009 was a military training exercise involving the Indian Navy, Sri Lanka Navy and the Indian Coast Guard. The three-day-long training exercise was held from 6 October to 8 October 2009. Training exercises between the two countries had been held annually, but this had been delayed because of the Sri Lankan Civil War. It was also the first training exercise between the two navies since the end of the war.\n\n[6] 39 Canadian Brigade Group: Exercise Cougar Salvo is 39 CBG's annual field training exercise which combines the brigade as a whole. Every year, the exercise is held in a different location, usually in British Columbia. In 2006, it was held in the streets of Kamloops, in 2007, at HMCS \"Quadra\" Sea Cadet Summer Training Centre near Comox. However, it has been held in other locations, such as in the United States. In 2012, Exercise Cougar Salvo was held in Boise, Idaho.\n\n[7] Operation Nanook: Operation Nanook 2012 was a military training exercise held in Canada's Arctic in August 2012. It was the sixth annual exercise. Vessels from the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard and the Royal Danish Navy participated in the exercise.\n\n[8] Embedded Training Teams: Since October 2006, the U.S. Army's 1st Infantry Division, based at Fort Riley, Kansas, was responsible for training all transition teams for service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Previously, advisor teams had been trained at several U.S. Army installations, most notably Fort Carson, Colorado; Camp Atterbury, Indiana; Fort Hood, Texas; and Camp Shelby, Mississippi. However, in early 2006, the U.S. Army decided to consolidate all training at Fort Riley in order to standardize and improve training for that critical mission. The Marines Corps initially coordinated all ETT training through the SCETC (Security Cooperation Education and Training Center) in Quantico Virginia and later, in 2008, SCETC established the Advisor Training Group in Twentynine Palms California. Additionally, the Marine ETTs assigned to the 201st Corps in RC east (2003-2010), went through a rigorous mountain warfare training program at the Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport California known as Mountain Viper.\n\n[9] SAFTI Military Institute: The SAFTI Military Institute (Abbreviation: SAFTI MI) is a tri-service military training institution for officers of all ranks of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Located within an 88 hectare campus in Jurong West, it was officially opened by the then-prime minister Goh Chok Tong on 25 August 1995. Officers from the Singapore Army, Republic of Singapore Navy and Republic of Singapore Air Force begin their training at the Officer Cadet School (OCS), before proceeding on to the SAF Advanced Schools and the Goh Keng Swee Command and Staff College (GKSCSC) at various stages of their careers.\n\n[10] Camp Shelby: Camp Shelby is a military post whose North Gate is located at the southern boundary of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, on United States Highway 49. It is the largest state-owned training site in the nation. During wartime, the camp's mission is to serve as a major independent mobilization station of the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM). Camp Shelby Joint Forces Training Center is the largest reserve component training site, covering , allowing up to battalion-level maneuver training, Gunnery Table 8-12, field artillery firing points and a wide range of support facilities. This is the normal Annual Training location for National Guard and Reserve units located in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. However, units from across the country use its assets to support a variety of missions. The 2nd Battalion, 114th Field Artillery conducts its gunnery training and has the bulk of its combat equipment stored in the Mobilization and Annual Training Equipment Site (MATES) located there.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nThe annual military training exercise SAMPRITI-IX will be held in which state?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\nThe question asks for the state where the SAMPRITI-IX military training exercise will be held, but none of the contexts mentions that particular exercise or the state it is being held in.", "Orca-2-7b": "\nYes, answer is present", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "I don't know"}}

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat number does the Roman numeral D stand for?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Pandigital number: While much of what has been said does not apply to Roman numerals, there are pandigital numbers: MCDXLIV, MCDXLVI, MCDLXIV, MCDLXVI, MDCXLIV, MDCXLVI, MDCLXIV, MDCLXVI. These, listed in , use each of the digits just once, while has pandigital Roman numerals with repeats.\n\n[2] Numeral system: More useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for \"one occurrence\", B \"two occurrences\", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing Chinese numerals and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the English language is of this type (\"three hundred [and] four\"), as are those of other spoken languages, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is \"soixante dix-neuf\" () and in Welsh is \"pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain\" () or (somewhat archaic) \"pedwar ugain namyn un\" (). In English, one could say \"four score less one\", as in the famous Gettysburg Address representing \"87 years ago\" as \"four score and seven years ago\".\n\n[3] Kharosthi: Kharosthi included a set of numerals that are reminiscent of Roman numerals. The system is based on an additive and a multiplicative principle, but does not have the subtractive feature used in the Roman number system. The numerals, like the letters, are written from right to left. There is no zero and no separate signs for the digits 5–9. Numbers in Kharosthi use an additive system. For example, the number 1996 would be written as 1000 4 4 1 100 20 20 20 20 10 4 2 (image: text: ).\n\n[4] Pentimal system: The notation is similar to the older Roman numerals for numbers 1 to 9 \"(I,II,III,IV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX)\". Unlike the Roman notation, there are only symbols for numbers one (\"I\") and five (\"U\"). In inscriptions the notches are placed vertically on the stem or \"stav\" of the rune. The number 4 is represented by four horizontal lines on the stem, 5 is represented by what looks like an inverted letter U. 10 is represented by two U's opposing each other. Numbers up to 19, or even 20, can be represented by a combination of I's and U's, just like the Roman numerals are represented by combinations of I's and V's. (A Roman 10 is represented by two V's opposing each other).\n\n[5] Roman numerals: Capital or small capital Roman numerals are widely used in Romance languages to denote , e.g. the French ' and the Spanish ' mean \"18th century\". Slavic languages in and adjacent to Russia similarly favour Roman numerals (). On the other hand, in Slavic languages in Central Europe, like most Germanic languages, one writes \"18.\" (with a period) before the local word for \"century\". Mixed Roman and Arabic numerals are sometimes used in numeric representations of dates (especially in formal letters and official documents, but also on tombstones). The is written in Roman numerals, while the day is in Arabic numerals: \"14..1789\" and \".14.1789\" both refer unambiguously to 14 June 1789. Roman numerals are sometimes used to represent the in hours-of-operation signs displayed in windows or on doors of businesses, and also sometimes in railway and bus timetables. Monday, taken as the first day of the week, is represented by . Sunday is represented by . The hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in Roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time. In the example case (left), the business opens from 10 am to 7 pm on weekdays, 10 AM to 5 pm on Saturdays and is closed on Sundays. Note that the listing uses 24-hour time. Roman numerals may also be used for floor numbering. For instance, apartments in central\n\n[6] Ross &amp; Co. Dublin Cabinet Makers: Ross’s numbering, for ease of assembly, of the individual parts that make up a piece of their furniture is also unique. Most campaign furniture makers used a simple system, often using Roman numerals but always starting, naturally, with the number one. Furniture by Ross is often given a two digit number or sometimes a letter and number depending on the item and Roman numerals are not noted as having been used. An example of such numbering is the set of four Balloon Back Chairs, illustrated, where the numbers range from 62 and 63 on the first chair to 70 and 71 on the second, 74 and 75 on the third and 92 and 93 on the fourth. Although at first this seemingly random system of numbering doesn’t seem to make sense it was probably logical for a factory that may have been making several pieces of the same item of furniture at the same time. Added to this Ross were probably selling their wares to members of the same regiments and their numbering system may well have saved future confusion amongst brother officers.\n\n[7] Roman numerals: Alfred Hooper has an alternative hypothesis for the origin of the Roman numeral system, for small numbers. Hooper contends that the digits are related to hand gestures for counting. For example, the numbers , , , correspond to the number of fingers held up for another to see. , then represents that hand upright with fingers together and thumb apart. Numbers 6–10, are represented with two hands as follows (left hand, right hand) 6=(,), 7=(,), 8=(,), 9=(,), 10=(,) and results from either crossing of the thumbs, or holding both hands up in a cross.\n\n[8] List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions: When expressing a numerical quantity, Roman numerals are commonly used in place of arabic digits so as to avoid confusion. The numbers 1 - 3 (I, II, III), usually written as upper-case Roman numerals, often have the appearance of a capital \"T\" or a series of capital \"T's\" with a dot above each \"T.\" They are also sometimes written as lower-case Roman numerals (i, ii, iii).\n\n[9] Roman numerals: The number zero does not have its own Roman numeral, but the word \"nulla\" (the Latin word meaning \"none\") was used by medieval scholars in lieu of 0. Dionysius Exiguus was known to use \"nulla\" alongside Roman numerals in 525. About 725, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter N, the initial of \"nulla\" or of \"nihil\" (the Latin word for \"nothing\"), in a table of epacts, all written in Roman numerals.\n\n[10] Roman numeral analysis: Roman numeral analysis is the use of Roman numeral symbols in the musical analysis of chords. In music theory related to or derived from the common practice period, Roman numerals are frequently used to designate scale degrees as well as the chords built on them. In some contexts, arabic numerals with carets are used to designate scale degrees (); theory related to or derived from jazz or modern popular music may use Roman numerals or arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...) to represent scale degrees \"(See also diatonic function)\".

Licensing activity begins in 1996 with Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, through the negotiations of Investment Banker, Paul M. Michaels, licenses Ambisome and Danisome for the Asian marketplace from a U.S. Pharmaceutical company. This is the beginning of business licensing U.S. developed drugs for the Japanese market. Additionally, an Orphan drug business is created with the assistance of Paul M. Michaels with his Japanese counterparts called Nobelpharma. Co.Ltd. The first licensed product, from Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, is for the treatment of Wilsons disease in Japan. This transaction was negotiated and completed by Paul Michaels.\n\n[2] John Thistlewood Davenport: John Thistlewood Davenport (1817–1901) was an English pharmacist and businessman. He was the founder of J. T. Davenport & Sons, a pharmaceuticals company based in Great Russell Street, London which bought the patent for Dr. John Collis Browne's 'chlorodyne' and sold the famous drug for ailments including headache, stomachache, insomnia, and cholera. Davenport served as Vice-President of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (formerly the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) from 1853–55 and as its President, 1855-56. An obituary for him in the Society's \"Pharmaceutical Journal\" gave this credit to him: “the first official recognition of the Society in connection with the British Pharmacopoeia may be said to date from the time of Mr. Davenport’s presidency.”\n\n[3] RXi Pharmaceuticals: RXi Pharmaceuticals in its first incarnation was founded in late 2006 by the Los Angeles-based drug development company CytRx and four scientific founders including Craig Mello, who had recently received the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his co-discovery of RNAi. The company was taken public in March 2008 when RXi Pharmaceuticals was spun out of CytRx as a separate company. In 2011 RXi Pharmaceuticals acquired Apthera, developer of a peptide vaccine called NeuVax, and changed its name to Galena Biopharma to reflect its change of focus. Galena Biopharma made the decision to spin out the siRNA programs into a separate company, again to be called RXi Pharmaceuticals. This second incarnation of RXi Pharmaceuticals was completed in 2012 when its stock started trading publicly.\n\n[4] Douglas Pharmaceuticals: Douglas Pharmaceuticals began when founder, Graeme Douglas, created a cough syrup called Kofsin, while working as a chemist in Te Atatu, West Auckland. As demand for the cough syrup grew, the company contracted manufacturing chemists to maintain enough supply. Afterwards, the company began importing niche pharmaceuticals and packaging them at Douglas's chemist shop before distributing them to other pharmacists. In the early 1970s, Douglas's chemist shop had over $2 million in revenue when he sold it to focus on the pharmaceutical business.\n\n[5] History of pharmacy: The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology. Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi (Rhazes) (865-915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936-1013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His \"Liber servitoris\" is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973-1050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology entitled \"Kitab al-Saydalah\" (\"The Book of Drugs\"), where he gave detailed knowledge of the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, mode of action and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in \"The Canon of Medicine\". Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty\n\n[6] Albert Hofmann: Hofmann became an employee of the pharmaceutical/chemical department of Sandoz Laboratories (now a subsidiary of Novartis), located in Basel as a coworker with professor Arthur Stoll, founder and director of the pharmaceutical department. He began studying the medicinal plant \"Drimia maritima\" (squill) and the fungus ergot, as part of a program to purify and synthesize active constituents for use as pharmaceuticals. His main contribution was to elucidate the chemical structure of the common nucleus of the \"Scilla\" glycosides (an active principal of Mediterranean squill). While researching lysergic acid derivatives, Hofmann first synthesized LSD on 16 November 1938. The main intention of the synthesis was to obtain a respiratory and circulatory stimulant (analeptic) with no effects on the uterus in analogy to nikethamide (which is also a diethylamide) by introducing this functional group to lysergic acid. It was set aside for five years, until 16 April 1943, when Hofmann decided to reexamine it. While re-synthesizing LSD, he accidentally touched his hand to his mouth, nose or possibly eye, ingesting a small amount, and discovered its powerful effects. He described what he felt as being:\n\n[7] Empire Laboratories: Empire Laboratories was a Canadian pharmaceutical company incorporated on August 21, 1959 as Empire Laboratories Limited by founder Louis Lloyd Winter in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It grew to become the largest pharmaceutical business in Canada during the 1960s, until the death of its founder on November 5, 1965.\n\n[8] Endo Pharmaceuticals Building: In 1969, Endo Pharmaceuticals was acquired by DuPont and the family-run business became a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont but still under the name of Endo Pharmaceuticals until 1984. In 1997, DuPont sold certain pharmaceutical products, related rights, and assets and the new owners started business again under the Endo name.\n\n[9] Pharmacy: The advances made in the Middle East in botany and chemistry led medicine in medieval Islam substantially to develop pharmacology.

Claiborne Robins School of Business: The E. Claiborne Robins School of Business is a part of the University of Richmond and was established in 1949. It offers undergraduate, graduate and executive education programs, and was named after alumnus E. Claiborne Robins Sr in 1979. Robins, the grandson of Albert Hartley Robins, founder of the A.H.

Smith High School in South Norfolk,Virginia, Beard was an All-American and also State Heavyweight Wrestling Champion in 1957 when his high school, Oscar F. Smith, did not have a wrestling team; the only time this has ever been accomplished by a wrestler. In 1960 Beard completed his post-graduate year at the Staunton Military Academy, where he was a standout football player. Beard played two years of college football at Tennessee before joining the Army, where he was selected Outstanding Player on the Army football team.\n\n[2] USS Burrows (DD-29): In June, she sailed from New York with Group 2, Cruiser and Transport Force, to escort the convoy which carried the first American Expeditionary Force to reach France. She arrived in the Loire River on 27 June 1917, and was assigned to patrol the south coast of Ireland, operating out of Queenstown, Ireland. \"Burrows\" patrolled; escorted convoys; answered Allied distress calls; landed survivors; and fought enemy submarines that hunted in the English Channel. On one occasion, she was in trouble with a broken oil line, which caused a fire on board. Four other destroyers assisted her in putting it out, but two crew members lost their lives. With the cessation of hostilities, she performed various duties at Brest, France, and was present at the reception of President Woodrow Wilson on 13 December 1918, when and escort arrived.\n\n[3] Mast Brothers: According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", in May 2011, Mast Brothers chartered the three-masted \"Black Seal\", a 70-foot schooner built over 25 years by Captain Eric Loftfield, to sail from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to the Dominican Republic in order to pick up 20 tons of cocoa beans. On June 14, 2011 the Black Seal arrived at the Red Hook waterfront in Brooklyn where a group of deckhands and makers of artisanal chocolate unloaded the cocoa beans from the schooner. It was the first time a sailing ship had unloaded commercial cargo in New York since 1939, according to one city official.\n\n[4] RFA Black Rover (A273): By February 2001, \"Black Rover\" set sail from Devonport Naval Base at the start of an 11-month deployment as the tanker assigned to the Atlantic patrol (south) task. Along with the destroyer , she visited a number of ports as they sailed south and made their way to the coast of West Africa to support British forces in and around Sierra Leone. Later in 2001, the tanker crossed the Atlantic and headed even further south as she proceeded to the more traditional patrol area of the Falkland Islands. She returned home to the UK in December.\n\n[5] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[6] 2008 Georgian spy plane shootdowns: It also claimed that white smoke trails such as seen behind the missile on the footage usually occur from land-to-air missile launches, and never with air-to-air missiles. “This is not a full list of inconsistencies in the obviously edited video footage. [The footage does not give] a clear picture of when and where the video was recorded. If watched carefully, one can clearly see two roads parallel to the shoreline,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said. “But there aren't such roads in the indicated area of Abkhazia’s coast. Abkhazia's famous sand beaches - 100 meters in width - are not seen in the footage, even though they can be seen by satellite.”\n\n[7] S͎: s͎ is represented in Unicode by an s and U+034E (Combining Upwards Arrow Below).\n\n[8] Abdelghani Bousta: From May 1973 to September 1974, Abdelghani Bousta lived in hiding. During this time, he realised the mistakes made when the March 1973 events were organised. In 1975, he wrote a critical analysis of UNFP on behalf of the Option Révolutionnaire (Revolutionary option) movement, harshly criticising the events and the leaders: “[...] the March 1973 events helped shed light on the internal contradictions of the Party and show the true nature of its leaders: putschist and adventurous leaders who did not see any problem in sacrificing dozens of activists in a hazardous battle.”\n\n[9] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H. Cockrum, Foram’s founder, chairman and CEO. “We wanted the most efficient office building ever designed, with no wasted space or wasted energy. This is a building of the future more than a building of the present. A lot of love has gone into that building, and a lot of pride.\"\n\n[10] MV Brown Bear: \"Brown Bear\" left Seattle on 3 April 1947 carrying FWS personnel to Southeast Alaska, where they worked the downstream pink salmon fry-counting weir at the FWS Little Port Walter field station at Port Walter, Territory of Alaska. After that, she served as a base of operations for the spring 1947 stream surveys headed by FWS biologist Samuel J. Hutchinson, operating skiffs with outboard motors to transport personnel between ship and shore. Upon completion of the survey in early May 1947. \"Brown Bear\" transferred the survey staff to the FWS vessel MV \"Brant\" so that they could conduct additional surveys in Alaska′s Ketchikan district, then departed Alaska to transport Hutchinson to Seattle.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [3].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know where Black Beard sailed?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\nNo, answer is not present in context [2].\nNo, answer is not present in context [3].\nNo, answer is not present in context [4].\nNo,", "flan-t5-xxl": "No", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

He believed that there was \"something of a fighter in Alf. He was in the Army during the war and probably had quite a difficult war. He's still interested in the weapons of the 1940s. All that has been glossed over. Part of the way I play him is that he has this experience behind the staid image. He has been to strip clubs with Ray Langton and Ernest Bishop, and he had a girlfriend called Donna Parker that no one in the street, only viewers, knew.\"\n\n[2] Shylock: Since Kean's time, many other actors who have played the role have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character. Edwin Booth was a notable exception, playing him as a simple villain, although his father Junius Brutus Booth had portrayed the character sympathetically. Henry Irving's portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by Ellen Terry) has been called \"the summit of his career\". Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century actors in this role, speaking in Yiddish in an otherwise English-language production.\n\n[3] Kevin Pollak: As an actor, Pollak's most notable roles are usually playing the best friend or confidant characters to the leading men, as he did in \"Ricochet\" (1991), \"A Few Good Men\" (1992), \"End of Days\" (1999), and \"The Wedding Planner\" (2001). However, he has also played a wide variety of parts, such as a criminal in \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995) and a gangster in \"The Whole Nine Yards\" (2000). He also briefly hosted \"Celebrity Poker Showdown\" in its first season. His most substantial role to date was in \"Deterrence\" (1999), in which he played the main character, a Vice President who must take over for a deceased President and deal with a nuclear crisis.\n\n[4] Perspective (film): From Rolf Leslie playing twenty-seven characters in the life story of Queen Victoria in the silent feature \"Sixty Years a Queen\" in 1913 to Eddie Murphy playing eight characters in \"\" in 2000, the casting of a performer to play two or more characters in a film is, and always has been, common. The history of casting a single actor as multiple characters in a play is perhaps as old as acting itself. Excepting Old Comedy, there is a well-known but little discussed rule in the drama of ancient Greece that only three actors played all the speaking characters in a tragedy. Over two thousand years later, even Shakespeare had a limited number of actors to cast in his plays (scholars’ estimates vary from eleven to sixteen), a theatrical exigency that occasioned much doubling and tripling of roles. This theatrical troupe mentality of having various actors playing various characters may also be located in the movies, such as those featuring the comedy group Monty Python, like \"Life of Brian\" in 1979. Regardless, the casting of an actor in multiple roles in the movies has been primarily conceptual, and not due to a lack of other performers.\n\n[5] Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical: The Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical is awarded to the actor who was voted as the best actor in a musical play, whether a new production or a revival. The award has been given since 1948, but the nominees who did not win have only been publicly announced since 1956. -*Most of the leading male characters in \"Little Me\" are played by the same actor, but the actual roles vary. In the original 1962 Broadway production and the 1998 revival, Sid Caesar and Martin Short (respectively) played Noble Eggleston, Amos Pinchley, Val du Val, Fred Poitrine, Otto Schnitzler, and Prince Cherney. Caesar also played Noble Junior. In the 1981 revival, the lead roles were split among James Coco and Victor Garber with Garber playing Noble Eggleston, Val du Val, Fred Poitrine, and Noble Junior.\n\n[6] Our Country's Good: The play has been written with the idea of doubling in mind, needing only ten actors for twenty-two roles. It is typically performed with performers changing costumes on stage; a wig and military uniform jacket marking the only differences between an officer and a convict. Ralph Clark is the only character that has to be played by an actor without a second role; every other actor plays at least one convict and one officer, with three actors even taking three roles. The following table shows the list of characters with all roles typically (as done by the original production and imitated by most later productions) taken by one actor in the same horizontal lineIn England, the play is used by the exam board AQA and Edexcel as a set text for Advanced Level Theatre Studies and as a set text to use in comparison essays for GCE. It has also been used in universities' performing arts and English departments. It has been performed across Europe as part of GCE candidates' final performances. It is also used at AS level in English Literature studies, as well as a set text in the OIB administered by CIE and is also commonly used in English speaking English Literature classes for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.\n\n[7] Motifs in the James Bond film series: Although other recurring characters in the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two actors have played the part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey in one of the non-Eon films, \"Never Say Never Again\".\n\n[8] Character actor: Unlike leading actors, they are generally seen as less glamorous. While a leading actor often has physical beauty needed to play the love interest, a character actor may be short or tall, heavy or thin, balding, older, or simply unconventional-looking and distinctive in some physical way. For example, the face of Chicago character actor William Schutz was disfigured in a car accident when he was five years old, but his appearance despite reconstructive surgery helped him to be memorable and distinctive to theater audiences. Generally, the names of character actors are not featured prominently in movie and television advertising on the marquee, since a character actor's name is not expected to attract film audiences. The roles that character actors play in film or television are often identified by only one name, such as \"Officer Fred\", while roles of leading actors often have a full name, such as \"Captain Jack Sparrow\". Some character actors have distinctive voices or accents, or they develop memorable mannerisms. A character actor with a long career may not have a well-known name, yet may be instantly recognizable.\n\n[9] Craig Montgomery: The role of Craig Montgomery has been played by four separate actors through the character's run. Scott Bryce appeared in the role from January 1982 to May 22, 1987, May 9, 1988 to November 1989, March 1990 to November 1990, March 1993 to December 1994 and April 10, 2007 to February 21, 2008. Hunt Block was the second actor to play the character from July 19, 2000 to October 31, 2005) before Jeffrey Meek joined from September 28, 2006 to April 2, 2007. Jon Lindstrom was the last actor to play the character from December 3, 2008 to September 10, 2010. Bryce is often considered to be the most well known actor in the role and was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1986 and 1987, as well as for two Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1986 and 1988. Following his final appearance on the show, Bryce appeared on ABC's \"One Life to Live\" as Dr. Crosby in 2006 and eventually co-created and executive produced the web series \"Steamboat\" with Michael O'Leary of \"Guiding Light\". The series was intended to become a cable television show until it was broadcast on the Internet. Block is also known for his daytime roles including Ben Warren on CBS' \"Guiding Light\", Lee Ramsey on \"One Life to Live\" and Guy Donohue on \"All My Children\". Following his exit, he also appeared in the 2010 feature film \"Salt\", which starred Angelina Jolie and Liev Schreiber. Meek has had a career all throughout television including The WB series \"Charmed\n\n[10] Character actor: Character actors tend to play the same type of role throughout their careers, including Harvey Keitel as a \"tough and determined guy\", Dame Maggie Smith as an \"upstanding lady matriarch\", Christopher Lloyd as an eccentric, Claude Rains as a \"sophisticated, sometimes ambiguously moral man\", Abe Vigoda as a \"leathery, sunken-eyed\" and tired hoodlum on the verge of retirement, Christopher Walken as a \"speech maker\", Vincent Schiavelli as \"the confused guy\", Fairuza Balk as a \"moody goth girl\", Steve Buscemi as \"a quirky, smart guy with a mind just outside of reality\" and Forest Whitaker as a \"calm, composed character with an edge and potential to explode\". Ed Lauter usually portrayed a menacing figure because of his \"long, angular face\" which was easily recognized in public, although audiences rarely knew his name. Character actors can play a variety of types, such as the femme fatale, gunslinger, sidekick, town drunk, villain, whore with a heart of gold, and many others. A character actor's roles are often perceived as being substantially different from their perceived real-life persona, meaning that they do not portray an extension of themselves, but rather a character substantially different from their off-screen persona. Character actors subsume themselves into the characters they portray, such that their off-screen acting persona is practical\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nWhich character has been played by the most actors?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nYes, answer is present in context [7].\n\nYes, answer is present in context [10].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "Multiple characters have been played by the most actors.

Aged only 21, she became the youngest European world champion ever.\n\n[2] Elizabeth Ryan: In the 1926 singles final at the U.S. Championships, the 34-year-old Ryan led 42-year-old Molla Bjurstedt Mallory 4–6, 6–4, 4–0 and had a match point at 7–6 in the third set before losing the final three games of the match.\n\n[3] Maud Barger-Wallach: She only began playing tennis when she was about 30 years old. In 1908 Barger-Wallach became the oldest U.S. Open champion at the age of 38 (42-year-old Molla Mallory won in 1926, taking away her old-age record).\n\n[4] Shadowboxing (Heroes): Peter has been using his new ability to stabilize critical patients he has been rescuing, but finds the process extremely taxing on him. Emma Coolidge helps stitch up a wound on a patient; when Peter asks where she learned how to do that, Emma reveals she had gone to medical school, but dropped out. Later, Emma helps revive a collapsed girl. Peter asks Emma why she dropped out, and she reveals that her nephew had drowned while she was momentarily distracted. Peter suggests she go back to school, after passing on thanks from the little girl. Later, Emma is shown pulling out her old lab coat from her closet. At Peter's apartment, Peter has begun taking down his wall of newspaper clippings chronicling his paramedic heroism, when he is interrupted by a knock on the door. Peter is surprised to see it is Nathan, who tells him he may be in trouble.\n\n[5] Snow Drifts: In the present day, Emma looks happy and sees Mary Margaret holding her baby boy as she prepares for the upcoming coronation even though they haven't named him yet. Henry is looking for apartments and both Henry and Mary Margaret ask Emma what she thinks. Emma changes the subject and starts thinking why her parents are trying to expand the time they need to name the unnamed baby by using an age-old tradition. Meanwhile, Regina and Robin Hood are sharing some romantic time together. She tells him about how TinkerBell told her about them being soulmates, how she saw the lion tattoo but didn't approach him in the pub. However, Robin is happy to hear that, saying it must be the right time for them now. Later on at Granny's, everyone is recalling or retelling stories of how Mary Margaret and David originally met back in the Enchanted Forest and how they kept running into one another and were destined to be together. When Emma reveals her desire to return to New York City with Henry in an attempt to leave Storybrooke behind, Regina and the others exclaim in protest. Suddenly Gold notices an orange beam rising in the distance, which he tells them is the time portal. As this starts to happen, Emma tells everyone that she wants to go back to New York City and everyone including Regina doesn't like the idea. Emma then walks out and Hook follows her, taking the fairytale book with him. Meanwhile, Regina, David, Belle, Gold, Robin,\n\n[6] Jarmila Wolfe: At the US Open in August, she reached the final round of qualifying with upset of Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain, but ultimately lost to Anikó Kapros of Hungary. Her season ended with two more losses in the later stages of qualifying draws at WTA events to higher ranked players. The 16-year-old Slovak ended the year ranked No. 197.\n\n[7] World Senior Chess Championship: Vlastimil Jansa won then the 65+ section at age of 76 in 2018 (his first gold medal), Gaprindashvili won the same year in the women group 65+ at age of 77.

Both films have the song at the end of the credits; the 2002 adaptation featured the original 1967 recording, and 2004's \"Spider-Man 2\" has a re-recording by Michael Bublé. 2007's \"Spider-Man 3\" features a performance of the song by a marching band at a public rally for Spider-Man. In 2014's \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" Peter uses a version of the theme as his ringtone. In 2017's \"\", an orchestral version plays over the Marvel Studios title card sequence. In 2018's \"\", the theme is briefly played at the beginning, when the original Peter Parker says he \"had a catchy theme song\".\n\n[2] Spider-Man (theme song): The Ramones recorded a cover of the song as a bonus track for their final album, 1995's \"¡Adios Amigos!\". A live version appears on their \"Greatest Hits Live\" album.\n\n[3] Richie Ramone: Reinhardt joined the Ramones in February 1983 before the release of \"Subterranean Jungle\", and appears in two music videos from that album, although he did not play on the record itself. In his first months with the group he broke the tradition of adopting the Ramones surname and instead performed under the stage name Richie Beau. However, by the time of his first recordings with the band he had switched to the name Richie Ramone. He played on the Ramones albums \"Too Tough to Die\", \"Animal Boy\" and \"Halfway to Sanity\" and appears on their compilation albums \"Greatest Hits\", \"\" and \"Weird Tales of the Ramones\", and on the Ramones live DVD \"It's Alive 1974-1996\". He penned the Ramones' hit song \"Somebody Put Something in My Drink\" which is included on the album \"Ramones Mania\", the first Ramones album to go gold, as well as \"Smash You\", \"Humankind\", \"I'm Not Jesus\", \"I Know Better Now\" and \"(You) Can't Say Anything Nice\". Richie's songs \"I'm Not Jesus\" and \"Somebody Put Something in my Drink\" have been covered by new generations of bands worldwide, particularly metal bands like Children of Bodom and Behemoth.\n\n[4] Standing in the Spotlight: This album was released in spring 1989, a few months before Dee Dee left the Ramones. The album marks a radical shift from the Ramones guitar-based punk rock. Dee Dee learnt about rap music during drug rehabilitation, which led him to record the boastful \"Funky Man\" in 1987, although that song did not end up on the album. Prior to leaving the group, Dee Dee would show up to Ramones gigs in full rap regalia, which frustrated his bandmates.\n\n[5] Dee Dee Ramone: In 1987, before leaving the Ramones, Dee Dee embarked on a brief hip hop career as rapper \"Dee Dee King\" with the album \"Standing in the Spotlight\". Dee Dee had recorded \"Funky Man\" as Dee Dee King in 1987. Music critic Matt Carlson wrote that the album \"will go down in the annals of pop culture as one of the worst recordings of all time\". After the album failed, he returned to punk rock with various short-lived projects such as Sprokkett (which also featured Richard 'The Atomic Elf' Bacchus of D Generation and the Spikey Tops). In 1987 Dee Dee wrote and produced a song called \"Baby Doll\" for the Chesterfield Kings (\"Baby Doll\"/\"I Cannot Find Her\", acoustic version 1987, Mirror Records, later recorded by American rock and roll band the Connection, on their album \"New England's Newest Hit Makers\"). Months after he left the Ramones, in the fall of 1989, Dee Dee already performed songs such as \"Poison Heart\" and \"Main Man\" (later to be recorded by the Ramones) with his band the Spikey Tops.\n\n[6] ¡Adios Amigos!: The Japanese version of the album features the bonus track \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.,\" originally recorded by Motörhead as a tribute to the Ramones on their \"1916\" album. The American version of the album features a hidden track, \"Spider-Man\", slightly different from the same song the Ramones originally recorded for the \"\" tribute album. C.J. Ramone sings lead vocals on tracks two, four, eight and ten, as well as the bonus track \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\" Dee Dee Ramone makes his first appearance on a Ramones album since 1989, singing in German and recorded via telephone during the bridge of \"Born to Die in Berlin\".\n\n[7] Spider-Man (theme song): \"Spider-Man\" is the theme song of the 1967 cartoon show \"Spider-Man\", composed by Paul Francis Webster and Robert \"Bob\" Harris. The original song was recorded at RCA Studios in Toronto (where the cartoon was also produced) featuring 12 CBC vocalists (members of the Billy Van Singers, and Laurie Bower Singers groups) who added to the musical backing track supplied by RCA Studios, New York. The singers were paid only for the session and have had no residuals from its use since then.\n\n[8] Mondo Bizarro: Mondo Bizarro (a misspelled version of \"Mondo Bizzarro\", meaning \"Weird World\" in Italian) is the twelfth studio album by the American punk band the Ramones, released in 1992. It is the first to feature their new bassist, C.J. Ramone, who replaced departed member Dee Dee Ramone. The album was re-released in the UK by the record label \"Captain Oi!\" on August 10, 2004, with the band's cover of the \"Spider-Man\" theme song as a bonus track.\n\n[9] Ramones covers album series: The series began when Selfless Records head Todd Greene contacted Chicago-based band Screeching Weasel while they were celebrating the completion of recording sessions for their album \"Wiggle\", asking if they would record their favorite Ramones album for his label. \"It was a completely stupid idea,\" wrote singer Ben Weasel several years later, \"so of course we did it. My favorite Ramones album is actually \"Leave Home\", but we all agreed we could do a halfway decent job with their first album.\" They recorded the album with recording engineer Mass Giorgini at his Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, working from midnight on October 17, 1992 until 2:00 AM the following day, with the band members acting as record producers. \"We recorded it at Sonic Iguana in something silly like fifteen hours\", wrote Weasel, \"and mixed it to sound like the first Ramones album (bass outta one speaker, guitar outta the other). It was stupid, but a lot of fun and it marks the only Screeching Weasel album on which [Dan] Vapid sang lead on a song ('Let's Dance').\" The cover photograph mimics the \"Ramones\" cover, with the band members (guitarist John Jughead Pierson, drummer Dan Panic, Weasel, and bassist Vapid) pictured in black and white against a brick wall, wearing torn blue jeans, black leather jackets, and Ramones T-shirts.\n\n[10] Ramones: In April 2009, \"Spin\" writer Mark Prindle observed that the Ramones had to date \"inspired a jaw-dropping 48 (at least!) full-length tribute records.\" The first Ramones tribute album featuring multiple performers was released in 1991: \"\" includes tracks by such acts as the Flesh Eaters, L7, Mojo Nixon, and Bad Religion. In 2001, Dee Dee made a guest appearance on one track of \"Ramones Maniacs\", a multi-artist cover of the entire \"Ramones Mania\" compilation album. \"The Song Ramones the Same\", which came out the following year, includes performances by the Dictators, who were part of the early New York punk scene, and Wayne Kramer, guitarist for the influential protopunk band MC5. \"\", released in 2003, features performers such as Rancid, Green Day, Metallica, Kiss, the Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, and Rob Zombie (who also did the album cover artwork). Also some other famous bands recorded tribute songs. Motörhead's Phil Campbell tells in Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone's book \"Ramones: Soundtrack Of Our Lives\": \"We did a cover of Rockaway Beach with me on backing vocals, which was quite enjoyable. When Johnny Ramone heard it, he refused to put it on the tribute album. Lemmy and I thought we did a good version.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in:\n\n[1] Spider-Man (1967 TV series): The 2002 and 2004 film versions included Jayce Bartok and Elyse Dinh,", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, the Ramones recorded the song Spider-Man in 1995 as a bonus track for their final album, ¡Adios Amigos!.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.\nI don't know.\nNo, answer is not present.", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

The first hybrid bus was introduced on route 360 in March 2006 and over 300 were in passenger service by July 2012. The world's first double-decker hybrid bus was introduced in London from January 2007. Transport for London initially stated that it intended to make all new buses delivered for use in London hybrids from 2012. This requirement was later dropped.\n\n[2] Tramways in Exeter: The tramways committee first introduced bus services in 1928 to serve areas which the trams did not go to. These motor buses were single deckers; Maudslay, Leyland and Bristols. The Maudslay ML3 no 5 (FJ6154)of this period is now preserved. After testing several different buses they eventually chose AEC Regent and Leyland TD2 double deckers (delivered in 1931). As the councillors could not decide whether to replace the trams completely with buses, they commissioned a report from an independent expert whose report was completed in April 1929. He found that there was a backlog of track renewals and other repairs, that the narrow streets were not suitable for trams and that at an average speed of 6.5 miles per hour (compared to 9.5 mph in London) the trams were slower than in any of 11 other cities. In council elections in November 1929, the Labour Party campaigned on a platform of keeping the trams but their vote declined. In 1930 the council finally decide to replace the trams with double-decker buses.\n\n[3] London Buses route 78: New Alexander Dennis Enviro400 double deckers were introduced on 17 April 2011, replacing the existing single deckers.\n\n[4] Double-decker bus: Double-decker buses in Russia are currently operated in the city of Barnaul, capital of Altai Krai. The fleet of double-decker buses in Barnaul consist of MAN SD200 and MAN SD202 buses imported from Berlin. Those buses are in use on routes 3, 10 and 17. Some cities in Russia, including Moscow and Saint Petersburg, have plans to begin operation of double-decker buses; in the mid-1990s, some double-deckers were operated briefly in Saint Petersburg. Double-decker buses were introduced in 2014 in Bilbao by the city bus operator Bilbobus. They are not the first double deck vehicles in the city as ex-London Transport Q1 trolleybuses were sold to Bilbao after the end of London trolleybus operations in 1962 and were operated until the system's closure in 1978. Initially, six vehicles are operating on Bilbobus route 56. They have a capacity of 132 passengers - 80 seated and fifty standing.\n\n[5] London Buses route 159: When introduced, the route was operated by STL-class double-deckers. In 1951, RTs and RTLs replaced the STLs. In June 1970, the RTs were replaced by AEC Routemasters. During the 1990s, London Buses' South London Transport subsidiary operated the route with Routemasters in a unique red and cream livery which was retained after South London was privatised and acquired by the Cowie Group in January 1995.\n\n[6] Double-decker bus: In the 1950s, double-decker buses of the South Western Bus Company plied on the Galle Road in Colombo, Sri Lanka. These were taken over by the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) when all bus services were nationalised in 1958. Beginning around 1959, large numbers of second-hand double-decker buses of the RT, RTL and RTW classes were imported by the CTB from London Transport, and ran in their original red livery with the oval CTB logo painted on the sides. These buses were phased out beginning in the mid-1970s, and none remain in service. Later, around 1985, 40 ex-London Routemaster entered service. One Routemaster bus is run by the \"Sirasa\" TV and radio station.\n\n[7] Thomas Tilling: The company put three Milnes-Daimler motor buses into service in 1904. These were open top double-deckers with 16 inside seats and 18 \"outside\" on the upper deck. These were the first double-decker motorbuses built for public service in London. By 1905, Tilling had 20 motor buses but still owned 7,000 horses, kept in 500 stables. The horses worked the company's 250 horse buses were hired to companies and individuals for hauling goods vehicles, cabs, and carriages. In 1907, Tilling began the first long-distance motor bus service, running 13 buses between Oxford Circus and Sidcup in Kent.\n\n[8] Double-decker bus: In 2007, a hybrid-powered double-decker entered service on London Buses route 141. By late 2008, more hybrid double-deckers from three manufacturers entered service in London. A New Routemaster was developed that year, and entered service on 20 February 2012. In October 2015, London added five all-electric double-decker buses - the world's first - made by Chinese firm BYD. Bus Vannin operate several double-deckers on routes all across the island.\n\n[9] Guy Motors: Growing populations in towns and cities meant larger capacity buses were a necessity, leading Guy to develop a 6-wheeled version of their dropped-frame chassis which allowed for the introduction of the first 6-wheeled double decker buses and 6 wheeled trolleybuses in 1926. Guy double decker buses and trolleybuses would prove popular with a fleet of double deckers sold to the London Public Omnibus Company and exports supplied all around the world. Exports served as a major source of income for Guy with sales to South Africa, Pakistan, India and the Netherlands, their armoured vehicles proving particularly popular for covering difficult terrain with 100 supplied to the Indian government in 1928.\n\n[10] London Buses route 15: Alexander Dennis Enviro400H double deckers were introduced in January 2012. New Routemasters were introduced on 28 February 2015. When next tendered, the route was taken awarded to Blue Triangle who commenced operations on 26 August 2017.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen were the first London double-decker buses introduced?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Her heir presumptive was her younger sister,\n\n[2] The Virgin Queen (TV serial): From her time as a young princess in her early twenties to her death in 1603, \"The Virgin Queen\" explores both the public and private life of Queen Elizabeth I (Anne-Marie Duff). The series focuses on the internal motivation behind 25 year old Elizabeth's vow of chastity upon her ascension to the throne. As a child, she confides in her friend Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester (Tom Hardy), that she wishes to never marry. Her relationship with Dudley, who would later become master of the Queen's horses, spans the four-part series and calls into question the ambiguous nature of their relations. The series features a scene where a dreaming Elizabeth fantasizes about making love to Dudley. When his wife Amy (Emilia Fox) dies under suspicious circumstances, Dudley proposes to the Queen and is rejected. Upon his death, Elizabeth's affections turn to Dudley's step-son Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Wessex. However, when he is caught making plans for a coup, she has him executed.\n\n[3] Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia: Part of the intent of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was to assassinate Elizabeth's father and the Protestant aristocracy, kidnap the nine-year-old Elizabeth from Coombe Abbey, and place her on the throne of England—and presumably the thrones of Ireland and Scotland—as a Catholic monarch. The conspirators chose Elizabeth after considering the other available options. Prince Henry, it was believed, would perish alongside his father. Charles was seen as too feeble (having only just learnt to walk) and Mary too young. Elizabeth, on the other hand, had already attended formal functions, and the conspirators knew that \"she could fulfil a ceremonial role despite her comparative youth\".\n\n[4] The Pirate Queen: In 1558, Henry VIII's successor, Mary Tudor, dies suddenly, and Elizabeth I ascends to the throne. Elizabeth knows that a young woman like herself will not be taken seriously as a monarch and so, on her first day as queen, she resolves never to let anyone see her as a female. She resolves to be “The Virgin Queen,” a monarch untouched by the taint of the flesh, and forbids her maidservants to gaze upon her unless she is clothed in her royal guise. (“The Waking of the Queen.”) Elizabeth summons her court, and shows her condescending ministers how forceful she intends to be as Queen (“Rah-Rah, Tip-Top”). The only disruption in her Empire, her royal advisor Sir Richard Bingham tells her, is rebellion in Ireland, a land her father failed to conquer completely. Not only that, but the English fleet is beset by a ferocious female sea captain named Grace O’Malley. Elizabeth rescinds Bingham's royal commission to Asia and instead names him Lord Governor of Ireland, with instructions to quell the Irish rebellion and kill Grace.\n\n[5] Elizabeth of Bosnia: Daughter of Ban Stephen II of Bosnia, Elizabeth became Queen of Hungary upon marrying King Louis I in 1353. In 1370, she gave birth to a long-anticipated heir, Catherine, and became Queen of Poland when Louis ascended the Polish throne. The royal couple had two more daughters, Mary and Hedwig, but Catherine died in 1378. Initially a consort with no substantial influence, Elizabeth then started surrounding herself with noblemen loyal to her, led by her favourite, Nicholas I Garai. When Louis died in 1382, Mary succeeded him with Elizabeth as regent. Unable to preserve the personal union of Hungary and Poland, the queen dowager secured the Polish throne for her youngest daughter, Hedwig.\n\n[6] House of Tudor: Even though Elizabeth was only twenty-five when she came to the throne, she was absolutely sure of her God-given place to be the queen and of her responsibilities as the 'handmaiden of the Lord'. She never let anyone challenge her authority as queen, even though many people, who felt she was weak and should be married, tried to do so. The popularity of Elizabeth was extremely high, but her Privy Council, her Parliament and her subjects thought that the unmarried queen should take a husband; it was generally accepted that, once a queen regnant was married, the husband would relieve the woman of the burdens of head of state. Also, without an heir, the Tudor line would end; the risk of civil war between rival claimants was a possibility if Elizabeth died childless. Numerous suitors from nearly all European nations sent ambassadors to English court to put forward their suit. Risk of death came dangerously close in 1564 when Elizabeth caught smallpox; when she was most at risk, she named Robert Dudley as Lord Protector in the event of her death. After her recovery, she appointed Dudley to the Privy Council and created him Earl of Leicester, in the hope that he would marry Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary rejected him, and instead married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, a descendant of Henry VII, giving Mary a stronger claim to the English throne. Although many Catholics\n\n[7] Elizabeth I of England: King Philip, who ascended the Spanish throne in 1556, acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sister-in-law. She was a better ally than the chief alternative, Mary, Queen of Scots, who had grown up in France and was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. When his wife fell ill in 1558, King Philip sent the Count of Feria to consult with Elizabeth. This interview was conducted at Hatfield House, where she had returned to live in October 1555. By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir. On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.\n\n[8] Elizabeth of Pomerania: After her husband's death at 29 November 1378 in Prague, Elizabeth's stepson Wenceslaus IV, son of Charles's previous wife, ascended the throne. Elisabeth then cared for her own two sons, mainly the older Sigismund, whom she supported in his efforts to become the king of Hungary.\n\n[9] Elizabeth of Austria (1526–1545): Elizabeth spent most of her childhood in the Hofburg, Innsbruck. She was raised with strict discipline and received a good education from humanist Kaspar Ursinus Velius, but was not taught the Polish language despite her early arranged marriage to Sigismund II Augustus. The marriage plan was first discussed when Elizabeth was just one year old. Louis, King of Hungary and Bohemia, died in August 1526 without leaving an heir. The Hungarian throne was contested between Louis' brother-in-law Ferdinand I and John Zápolya. Louis' uncle Sigismund I the Old and Hungarian nobility supported Zápolya. The marriage of Elizabeth to Sigismund's son was proposed as the means to discontinue Polish support to Zápolya. Polish Queen Bona Sforza opposed the wedding as she opposed the growing influence of the Habsburgs.\n\n[10] History of County Kildare: When the English crown turned back to Catholicism under Queen Mary in 1555–58, Thomas Leverous became the first native Kildare bishop in 400 years, being of Norman descent. In 1558 the new queen, Elizabeth I, ascended the throne and as Leverous refused to take the Oath of Allegiance he was deprived of his see. Pope Pius V, in his papal bull \"Regnans in Excelsis\", finally declared Elizabeth to be an illegitimate heretic in 1570, and from this point on it became harder for Kildare's landed families, most of whom were Catholic, to be simultaneously loyal to the queen and also to be observant Catholics. Kildare's numerous Norman families became known as Old English, to distinguish them from newer arrivals who conformed to the state religion.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the context number(s) where the answer to the question can be found.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The original line-up included former WBC world bantamweight champion Wayne McCullough, former British, Commonwealth and European champion Esham Pickering, former English champion Mark Moran and unbeaten prospects Craig Lyon and Ricky Owen. Josh Wale, Chris Riley and Gavin Reid completed the line up. McCullough, Lyon and Riley withdrew in the weeks leading up to the tournament and were replaced by 2002 Commonwealth Games gold medallist Jamie Arthur, undefeated Irishman Willie Casey, and Robbie Turley.\n\n[2] Prizefighter series: On 4 December 2009, the tournament saw the light welterweight's competing for the first time. Amongst the contestants was Gavin Rees, the first former World champion to compete in the tournament's history. The competition also had a number of European champions competing with Colin Lynes, Jason Cook and Ted Bami, a man who had also reached the final of the Welterweight prizefighter tournament in October 2008. Former British champions David Barnes and Young Mutley also took part as did unbeaten fighter Michael Grant and Welshman Barrie Jones. The draw for the competition was conducted by Floyd Mayweather, Jr..\n\n[3] Prizefighter series: On 19 January 2013, at the Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, the 28th installment of the Prizefighter competition showcased a field of fighters from the welterweight division. The tournament saw the greatest number of unbeaten fighters enter, with six men starting the night with their '0' intact. The eight participants were: Mark Thompson 24(14)-2, Rob Hunt 16(1)-1-2, Sam Eggington 3(0)-0, Dale Evans 4(3)-0-1, Chad Gaynor 9(4)-0, Calum Cooper 4(0)-0, Steven Pearce 6(1)-0 and Glenn Foot 7(4)-0.\n\n[4] Prizefighter series: The fifth instalment of the Prizefighter franchise took place on 20 February 2009 with the weight division on this occasion being light heavyweight. Boxers taking part in the competition were Courtney Fry, Shon Davies, Tony Oakey, Billy Boyle, Bob Ajisafe, Carl Dilks, Darren Stubbs and Steve Spartacus. Former British champion Tony Oakey eventually won the tournament having defeated Billy Boyle and Courtney Fry on the way to a final win over Darren Stubbs. The sixth installment of the Prizefighter franchise took place on 24 March 2009 at the Kelvin Hall, Scotland with the weight division on this occasion being lightweight. Boxers taking part in the competition were Ryan Brawley, Ben Murphy, Paul Holborn, Charlie King, Gary McArthur, Steve Saville, Stephen Burke and Stuart Green. Brawley won the tournament with victories over Murphy, Holborn and Burke in the final.\n\n[5] Prizefighter series: On 9 October 2010, the York Hall played host to the fourth outing for the heavyweights as part of the Prizefighter series. Contestants taking part included the former British, European and Commonwealth champion Matt Skelton and the former British and Commonwealth champion Michael Sprott. Other boxers taking part included Kevin McBride, the last man to beat Mike Tyson, Franklin Egobi, Ali Adams, Shane McPhilbin, Declan Timlin and Danny Hughes. The tournament was won by Sprott who beat Danny Hughes in the quarter finals, Shane McPhilbin in the semis and Matt Skelton in the final. The fight against Skelton in particular was notable for Sprott in that it was the third time the two had met in the ring with Skelton having won the previous two fights. Sprott himself was also coming into the tournament on the back of a defeat in a European title challenge to Audley Harrison, the winner of the previous Prizefighter tournament featuring heavyweights.\n\n[6] Prizefighter series: The seventh instalment of the Prizefighter franchise took place on 19 May 2009 at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London with the weight division on this occasion being cruiserweight. Boxers taking part in the competition were Darren Corbett, Terry Dunstan, Dean Francis, John Keeton, Ovill McKenzie, Bruce Scott, Neil Simpson (boxer)|Neil Simpson and Mickey Steeds. Mark Krence was originally drafted in, but replaced by McKenzie after he was forced to withdraw due to injury. McKenize went on to win the title scoring wins over Dunstan, Corbett and Keeton in the final.\n\n[7] The Prizefighter and the Lady: On March 16, 1934, \"The Prizefighter and the Lady\" premiered at the Capitol Theater in Berlin. However, when permission was sought to show a German-dubbed version, Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels had the film banned in Germany because, as one of his underlings stated, \"the chief character is a Jewish boxer\" (Baer's grandfather was Jewish). Baer contended, however, that \"They didn't ban the picture because I have Jewish blood. They banned it because I knocked out Max Schmeling\" on June 8, 1933.\n\n[8] Patrick Mendy: On 30 June 2010 Mendy competed in the 13th series of Prizefighter and came out the eventual winner of the competition. He came into the competition following a loss from undefeated Kenny Anderson. In his first fight he beat Sam Horton by TKO in the 1st round and broke the record for the fastest ever knockout in Prizefighter at 82 seconds (1:22min). In the semi-final he beat Daniel Cadman by unanimous decision with all the scorecards reading 29-28 in favour of Mendy. In the final he fought in form Paul David and won on unanimous decision again and received £32,000 for his win, the judges scorecards were all in favour of Mendy, 29-28, 29-28, 30-27. In this series he broke an outstanding 3 Prizefighter records:\n\n[9] Prizefighter series: On 21 November 2010, again at the York Hall, the 15th installment of the Prizefighter competition showcased boxers from the super featherweight division for the first time. Contestants taking part included the reigning British champion Gary Sykes and a former British and European title challenger in Gary Buckland. Ben Murphy and Gary McArthur had both previously contested the lightweight installment of the Prizefighter tournament on 24 March 2009. Choi Tseveenpurev, the WBU title holder, Derry Mathews, the former WBU title holder, Stevie Bell and Scott Lawton made up the rest of the competitors.\n\n[10] Prizefighter series: On 30 June 2010, the first ever super middleweights Prizefighter took place in York Hall, London. The original line up featured former British champions Tony Dodson and Tony Quigley, former English champion Paul David, former BBofC Celtic champion Stevie McGuire, former British Masters champion Eddie McIntosh, as well as Daniel Cadman and Peter Fedorenko. For the first time, it was decided that the eighth competitor would be decided by an online public vote. The winner of the vote was former BBofC Southern Area champion Tony Salam. In the buildup to the event, Dodson, McGuire, Quigley and Salam all withdrew, and were replaced by Gambia-born Patrick Mendy, who at 19 years old was the youngest ever Prizefighter contender, former Midlands Area champion Sam Horton, former Western Area champion Carl Drake, and unbeaten Welshman Jeff Evans.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any more information.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Matt Zimmerman voiced the character for all but one of his 1960s appearances; since Zimmerman was a late addition to the cast, Ray Barrett provided Alan's voice for his debut appearance in the series opener, \"Trapped in the Sky\".\n\n[2] Vernon Zimmerman: Vernon Zimmerman is an American writer and director who made his feature debut as director with the 1962 short \"Lemon Hearts\" starring Andy Warhol associate Taylor Mead. Zimmerman wrote and directed the Claudia Jennings roller derby drive-in film \"Unholy Rollers\" and collaborated with Terrence Malick on the script to the road movie \"Deadhead Miles\". He is most well known for his horror slasher film \"Fade to Black\", a dark and despairing psychological study of an awkward and alienated hardcore film buff who exacts a harsh revenge on his cruel tormentors. Zimmerman received a Saturn Award nomination as Best Director for the film, a predecessor to more well-known modern parodies of the horror genre. Vernon also wrote the scripts for the horror-Western \"Hex\" (a.k.a. \"Charmed\"), the redneck crime exploitation film \"Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw\", the made-for-TV wrestling comedy/drama \"Mad Bull\", the failed TV pilot film \"Shooting Stars\", and the teen fantasy comedy \"Teen Witch\". Zimmerman's latest film is the six-minute comic short \"Chuck and Wally on the Road\". More recently Vernon has been working as a script analyst. He also teaches screen-writing courses at UCLA's Extension and Certificate Program. Zimmerman also taught classes on both writing feature scripts and directing actors for film and television at the USC School of Cinema and Television. Vernon Zimmerman lives in Los Angeles and is a member of both the \n\n[3] Frederick Hinde Zimmerman: Frederick Hinde Zimmerman (October 17, 1864 – September 21, 1924) was an American banker, farmer, real estate entrepreneur, businessman, and hotel owner. Due to his large land holdings and expertise in farming Zimmerman became a notable farmer, breeder, and real estate entrepreneur during his life. Zimmerman's farm, originally purchased by his grandfather Thomas S. Hinde from the federal government in 1815, included the Grand Rapids Dam, Hanging Rock, and Buttercrust. His first experience running a business was in 1883 when he ran a grocery store in Fort Smith, Arkansas with his cousin Harry Hinde. Many of Zimmerman's businesses centered on his family farm, but in later years Zimmerman achieved success through his ownership and investment in mines, banks, and real estate. He also owned or invested in the Hanging Rock and Grand Rapids Dam Farm Company, the Grand Rapids Hotel Park Company, and the Wabash Bull-Frog Mines Company.\n\n[4] Eugene Zimmerman: Eugene \"Zim\" Zimmerman (May 26, 1862 – March 26, 1935) was a Swiss-American cartoonist. He was born in Basel, Switzerland. His mother died and he was sent to live with relatives in Alsace. In 1867 his father, who was a baker, and an older brother emigrated to the United States. In 1868 Zimmerman was placed on a ship and followed them.\n\n[5] Shooting of Trayvon Martin: In an open letter on March 15, 2012, Zimmerman's father, Robert Zimmerman, defended his son against allegations that his actions were racially motivated, stating that Zimmerman was Hispanic, was raised in a multiracial family, and \"would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever\", saying that the portrayal of his son as a racist \"could not be further from the truth\". Just as George Zimmerman's trial was set to begin, Robert Zimmerman published an e-book about the case in which he said that prior to the shooting, he had generally believed racism was no longer much of a problem and that he had personally not experienced much racism, despite being married to a Hispanic woman, but that since the shooting he had found that racism is \"flourishing at the insistence of some in the African American Community\". In a chapter called \"Who are the True Racists\", Robert Zimmerman listed a host of African Americans he says are racist, including the Congressional Black Caucus, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Basketball Players Association, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the National Black Chamber of Commerce, and the United Negro College Fund, among others.\n\n[6] Dick Zimmerman: Richard “Dick” Zimmerman (born August 11, 1937) is a ragtime performer, historian, author and producer. He is regarded as being one of the key figures responsible for the worldwide revival of ragtime. Zimmerman is the only pianist to have recorded the complete works (66 rags on solo piano) of Scott Joplin and in 1987 was awarded the first place prize “Champion Ragtime Performer of the World”. Zimmerman was technical advisor for the films \"Scott Joplin\" and \"Scott Joplin, King of Ragtime Composers\". He is a founder of the \"Maple Leaf Club\", and is the editor of its publication, \"\"The Rag Times\"\". Zimmerman is also a professional magician. He has contributed many signature illusions to the field of magic and has acted as consultant for such magicians as David Copperfield.\n\n[7] Arthur Augustus Zimmerman: Zimmerman, known as \"Zimmy\" or \"Zim\", was a lean, athletic-looking man who stood 5 ft 11 in. He was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of a real estate broker known as T.A., and grew up in Freehold. There he excelled at county level in high jump, long jump and triple jump, competing for the military school he attended.\n\n[8] George Zimmerman: George Michael Zimmerman was born on October 5, 1983, in Manassas, Virginia, to Gladys Cristina (\"née\" Mesa) Zimmerman and Robert Zimmerman Sr. He is the third of four children, and his siblings include a brother, Robert Jr., and two sisters, Grace and Dawn. His mother was born in Peru and has some African ancestry through her Afro-Peruvian maternal grandfather. His father is an American of German descent and a career military officer. He served 22 years in the military, working for the Department of Defense for the last 10 years of his military career. Before retiring to Florida in 2002, Zimmerman Sr. had served as a magistrate in Fairfax County's 19th Judicial District.\n\n[9] Thomas Zimmerman: Zimmerman was born in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania in the United States in 1838. There he attended public school until he was thirteen years old, and was apprenticed as a printer with the \"Lebanon Courier\". Upon completion of his apprenticeship, he went to Philadelphia to work at the \"Philadelphia Inquirer\". In 1856, he became a journeyman printer with the \"Berks and Schuylkill Journal\". He relocated to Columbia, South Carolina in 1859, and returned to the Reading area at the outset of the American Civil War, where in 1863 he enlisted in Company C of the 42nd Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. Although he is sometimes referred to as \"Colonel,\" he saw no active service during the war. On June 11, 1867 he married Tamsie T. Kauffman of Reading. By 1897, he was the president of the \"Reading Times\" Publishing Company and editor of the \"Reading Times\" newspaper. In 1903, a volume titled \"Olla Podrida\" was published of his translations. In 1904, he was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Zimmerman retired from his newspaper career in October, 1908.\n\n[10] Alan Tracy: Zimmerman was recommended to producers Gerry and Sylvia Anderson by David Holliday, the voice of Virgil Tracy. In an interview, Zimmerman remembered of his casting: \"They were having great difficulty in casting the part of Alan Tracy as they wanted a certain sound for him ...As I walked in [Sylvia Anderson] looked at me and said, 'Don't talk! Oh, my god, you've got those big eyes and the cleft in the chin and the cheek bones, and if you were blond you'd look very much like Alan.' She said, 'Now, sit down. What's you're [sic] name again?' And I said, 'My name is Matt Zimmerman and I'm from Detroit, Michigan,' and she said, 'That's the voice!'

He states that “context does not determine (in the sense of constitute), but merely enables the hearer to determine (in the sense of ascertain) what the speaker means.” Context provides constraints on what a speaker can reasonably mean and on what a hearer can reasonably interpret a speaker to mean. “contextualist platitude” does not preclude the “older picture of language and communication” and “a fairly standard semantic-pragmatic distinction.” Pragmatic considerations and context do not contribute to the content of what is said. Bach admits that there is meaning in utterances beyond the semantic content of a sentence, but he maintains that context does not determine speaker meaning but rather constrains how a speaker can expect to be understood and helps the hearer understand what is said. “We need the level of locutionary act and, correlatively, a strict, semantic notion of what is said in order to account for (the content of) what a speaker does in uttering a sentence independent\n\n[2] Lullatone: Lullatone is a Japanese musical duo based in Nagoya, whose music is characterized by an innocent, childlike quality and spare, lo-fi sounds. Although the group refers to their style of music as \"pajama-pop\", it is commonly included in such musical subgenres as electronic and indie pop. It is influenced by such diverse sources as bossa nova, French pop music of the 1960s, children's songs and musique concrète.\n\n[3] Abandoned Luncheonette: Abandoned Luncheonette is the second studio album by the American pop rock duo Hall & Oates, released in 1973, which combines folk, Philly soul, and acoustic soul. It is the most commercially successful of their first three albums of the duo's Atlantic Records period, the album reached #33 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs & Tapes chart. Twenty-nine years after its release, the album was certified platinum (over one million copies sold) by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\n[4] Rhetorical situation: In essence, Vatz claims that the definitive elements of rhetorical efforts are the struggle to create for a chosen audience saliences or agendas, and this creation is then followed by the struggle to infuse the selected situation or facts with meaning or significance. What are we persuaded to talk about? What are we persuaded it means or signifies? These questions are prior to: What does the situation make us talk about? or, What does it intrinsically mean?\n\n[5] Adam Cost: When asked in 1993 by a \"The New York Times\" Style reporter what it all meant, Cost said, \"If you could give us [Cost and Revs] the meaning of life, I’d give you the meaning of us.\" At that time the posters included a phone number; those who called heard a woman's recorded voice repeat their questions back to them: \"My intuition tells me that you're asking yourselves who are Revs and Cost and what are they doing? What is it? What does it mean? What does it mean?

One letter writer called Cost \"probably the worst graffiti vandal in the history of New York.\"\n\n[6] What Does Anything Mean? Basically: \"What Does Anything Mean?

Many of these heavy metals are toxic and some are radioactive, but platinum and gold are largely inert.\n\n[2] List of elements by stability of isotopes: Of the first 82 elements in the periodic table, 80 have isotopes considered to be stable. The 83rd element, bismuth, was traditionally regarded as having the heaviest stable isotope, bismuth-209, but in 2003 researchers in Orsay, France, measured the half-life of to be . Technetium, promethium (atomic numbers 43 and 61, respectively) and all the elements with an atomic number over 82 only have isotopes that are known to decompose through radioactive decay. No undiscovered elements are expected to be stable; therefore, lead is considered the heaviest stable element. However, it is possible that some isotopes that are now considered stable will be revealed to decay with extremely long half-lives (as with ). This list depicts what is agreed upon by the consensus of the scientific community as of 2016.\n\n[3] Period (periodic table): Period 5 has the same number of elements as period 4 and follows the same general structure but with one more post transition metal and one fewer nonmetal. Of the three heaviest elements with biological roles, two (molybdenum and iodine) are in this period; tungsten, in period 6, is heavier, along with several of the early lanthanides. Period 5 also includes technetium, the lightest exclusively radioactive element.\n\n[4] Period (periodic table): All elements of period 7 are radioactive. This period contains the heaviest element which occurs naturally on Earth, plutonium. All of the subsequent elements in the period have been synthesized artificially. Whilst five of these (from americium to einsteinium) are now available in macroscopic quantities, most are extremely rare, having only been prepared in microgram amounts or less. Some of the later elements have only ever been identified in laboratories in quantities of a few atoms at a time.\n\n[5] Period 6 element: Astatine is a radioactive chemical element with the symbol At and atomic number 85. It occurs on the Earth only as the result of decay of heavier elements, and decays away rapidly, so much less is known about this element than its upper neighbors in the periodic table. Earlier studies have shown this element follows periodic trends, being the heaviest known halogen, with melting and boiling points being higher than those of lighter halogens.\n\n[6] Flerovium: In the periodic table of the elements, it is a transactinide element in the p-block. It is a member of the 7th period and is the heaviest known member of the carbon group; it is also the heaviest element whose chemistry has been investigated. Initial chemical studies performed in 2007–2008 indicated that flerovium was unexpectedly volatile for a group 14 element; in preliminary results it even seemed to exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases. More recent results show that flerovium's reaction with gold is similar to that of copernicium, showing that it is a very volatile element that may even be gaseous at standard temperature and pressure, that it would show metallic properties, consistent with it being the heavier homologue of lead, and that it would be the least reactive metal in group 14. The question of whether flerovium behaves more like a metal or a noble gas is still unresolved as of 2018.\n\n[7] Period (periodic table): Period 4 includes the biologically essential elements potassium and calcium, and is the first period in the d-block with the lighter transition metals. These include iron, the heaviest element forged in main-sequence stars and a principal component of the Earth, as well as other important metals such as cobalt, nickel, and copper. Almost all have biological roles.\n\n[8] Tennessine: Tennessine is a synthetic chemical element with symbol Ts and atomic number 117. It is the second-heaviest known element and the penultimate element of the 7th period of the periodic table.\n\n[9] Period 7 element: A period 7 element is one of the chemical elements in the seventh row (or \"period\") of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The seventh period contains 32 elements, tied for the most with period 6, beginning with francium and ending with oganesson, the heaviest element currently discovered. As a rule, period 7 elements fill their 7s shells first, then their 5f, 6d, and 7p shells, in that order; however, there are exceptions, such as plutonium.\n\n[10] Mendeleev's predicted elements: Dmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869 based on properties that appeared with some regularity as he laid out the elements from lightest to heaviest. When Mendeleev proposed his periodic table, he noted gaps in the table and predicted that as-then-unknown elements existed with properties appropriate to fill those gaps. He named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium and eka-silicon with atomic masses 44, 68 and 72 respectively.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present\n\nNo, I don't know\n\nPlease select one of the above options based on the information provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nI don't know in context [2].\nI don't know in context [3].\nI don't know in context [4].\nI don't know in", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

The fish are ovoviviparous with the developing embryos feeding on the yolks of their eggs. It is not known how many young can be carried at one time nor how frequently the fish can breed, but the young are about long when they are born. Maximum longevity in this species is estimated to be forty-eight years.\n\n[2] Atlanticopristis: The specimens range in size from 11.5 mm (0.45 inches) to 18.8 mm (0.74 inches). The holotype (CPHNAMA-VT 1174) is 15 mm (0.59 inches) in length, including the peduncle; which itself is 6.3 mm (0.24 inches) wide, and 3 mm (0.11 inches) long. It has a thickness of 3 mm (0.11 inches). The barb number on all specimens ranges from two to four barbs at the front margin and four to five at the rear, some specimens like CPHNAMA-VT 1085 having vestigial bumps that could be considered additional barbs. Sawfish evolved long snouts armed with rows of teeth on both sides, although these spines do not represent true teeth, but highly modified fish scales, or dermal denticles. This adaptation could be related to their feeding habits, such as sifting through sand/mud to search for food or to slash at prey. Like extant sawsharks, these spines were attached to the rostrum of sclerorhynchids like \"Atlanticopristis\" using ligaments, compared to modern sawfish which have their teeth attached via alveoli (tooth sockets). The longitudinal ribbing, or ridges, of enameloid that can be seen on sclerorhynchid teeth would have aided in the attachment of these ligaments.\n\n[3] Sawfish: Relatively little is known about the reproductive habits of the sawfish, but all species are ovoviviparous with the adults females giving birth to live young once a year or every second year. In general, males appear to reach sexual maturity at a slightly younger age and smaller size than females. As far as known, sexual maturity is reached at an age of 7–12 years in \"Pristis\" and 2–3 years in \"Anoxypristis\". In the smalltooth and green sawfish this equals a total length of , in the largetooth sawfish at , in the dwarf sawfish about , and in the narrow sawfish at . This means that the generation length is about 4.6 years in the narrow sawfish and 14.6–17.2 years in the remaining species.\n\n[4] Longcomb sawfish: Little is known of its life cycle, but it is ovoviviparous and the young are long at birth. It is often said that there are about 12 young in each litter, but the basis for this number is unclear (in other sawfish species litter size ranges from 1 to 20). The females give birth in inshore areas, and the young stay near the coast and in estuaries in the first part of their lives. Sexual maturity is reached at an age of about 9 years, and a length of . The maximum age is unknown, but it might be in excess of 50 years, and an individual caught as a juvenile lived for 35 years at an aquarium.\n\n[5] Sawfish: The length of the full lifespan of sawfish is labeled with considerable uncertainty. A green sawfish caught as a juvenile lived for 35 years in captivity, and a smalltooth sawfish lived for more than 42 years in captivity. In the narrow sawfish it has been estimated that the lifespan is about 9 years, and in the \"Pristis\" sawfish it has been estimated that it varies from about 30 to more than 50 years depending on the exact species.\n\n[6] Smalltooth sawfish: Elasmobranchs are ovoviparous, have relatively long gestation periods, and internal fertilization. The sawfish eggs hatch in the uterus and the young continue to grow without a placental connection to the mother. The fetal sawfish receives nourishment from a yolk sac and absorbs all the nutrients it can from the yolk before it is born. Litters have been reported of up to 20 pups and the reproductive cycle is believed to be every two years. After sex, mating pairs separate without forming a pair bond and each continues polygamous matings.\n\n[7] Knifetooth sawfish: The breeding behaviour of the knifetooth sawfish has been little studied. Fertilisation is internal and a number of young develop at one time in the oviduct, each one being nourished from a yolk sac. They are born, probably after a gestational period of about five months, and litter sizes of 6 to 23 young have been recorded. The pups are probably long at birth and their rostral teeth are not fully developed, being covered by a membrane, and this prevents them from damaging the mother's tissues.\n\n[8] Sawfish: The pregnancy lasts several months. There are 1–23 young in each sawfish litter, which are long at birth. In the embryos the rostrum is flexible and it only hardens shortly before birth. To protect the mother the saws of the young have a soft cover, which falls off shortly after birth. The pupping grounds are in coastal and estuarine waters. In most species the young generally stay there for the first part of their lives, occasionally moving upriver when there is an increase in salinity. The exception is the largetooth sawfish where the young move upriver into freshwater where they stay for 3–5 years, sometimes as much as from the sea. In at least the smalltooth sawfish the young show a degree of site fidelity, generally staying in the same fairly small area in the first part of their lives. In the green and dwarf sawfish there are indications that both sexes remain in the same overall region throughout their lives with little mixing between the subpopulations. In the largetooth sawfish the males appear to move more freely between the subpopulations, while mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young.\n\n[9] List of threatened rays: Sawfish are a less well known family of rays which have a long rostrum resembling a saw. Some species can reach in length. All species of sawfish are either endangered or critically endangered as a result of habitat destruction and overfishing. Their young stay close to shore, and are particularly affected by coastal developments. Because their rostrum is easily entangled, sawfishes can easily become bycatch in fishing nets. They are also exploited for the novelty value of their rostrum, their fins are eaten as a delicacy in China, and their liver oil used as a food supplement. While arguing for a global ban on international commerce in 2007, a representative from the National Museums of Kenya stated, \"Only the meat is consumed locally; and artisanal fishermen can retire after catching one sawfish due to the high value of a single rostrum, up to $1,450.\" In 2013 CITES uplisted the largetooth sawfish to Appendix I. This is CITES highest protection level, and means that all international trade of the species is banned.\n\n[10] Largetooth sawfish: Sexual maturity is reached at a length of about when 7–10 years old. Breeding is seasonal in this ovoviviparous species, but the exact timing appears to vary depending on the region. The adult females can breed once every 1–2 years, the gestation period is about five months, and there are indications that mothers return to the region where they were born to give birth to their own young. There are 1–13 (average 7) young in each litter, which are long at birth. They are likely typically born in salt or brackish water near river mouths, but move into freshwater where the young spend the first 3–5 years of their life, sometimes as much as upriver. In the Amazon basin the largetooth sawfish has been reported even further upstream, and this mostly involves young individuals that are up to long. Occasionally, young individuals become isolated in freshwater pools during floods and may live there for years. The potential lifespan of the largetooth sawfish is unknown, but four estimates suggested 30 years, 35 years, 44 years, and 80 years.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nHow long do sawfishes get?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "How long do sawfishes get?\n\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if you found the answer to the question in one of the contexts, or \"I don't know\" if you did not find the answer", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the cause of World War 2?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Causes of World War I: \"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the Mediterranean?\"\n\n[2] War: Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see mutual assured destruction), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear World War III. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the League of Nations, and its successor, the United Nations. In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated, \"I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.\"\n\n[3] Causes of World War II: Spain negotiated with joining the Axis but remained neutral during World War II, and did business with both sides. It also sent a volunteer unit to help the Germans against the USSR. Whilst it was considered in the 1940s and 1950s to be a prelude to World War II and It prefigured the war to some extent (as it changed it into an antifascists contest after 1941), it bore no resemblance to the war that started in 1939 and had no major role in causing it.\n\n[4] Historiography of the causes of World War I: In a 1972 essay \"World War I As a Galloping Gertie\", the American historian Paul W. Schroeder blamed Britain for the First World War. Schroeder argued that the war was a \"Galloping Gertie\", that it got out of control, sucking the Great Powers into an unwanted war. Schroeder thought that the key to the European situation was what he claimed was Britain's \"encirclement\" policy directed at Austria-Hungary. Schroeder argued that British foreign policy was anti-German and even more anti-Austrian. Schroeder argued that because Britain never took Austria-Hungary seriously, it was British policy to always force concessions on the Dual Monarchy with no regard to the balance of power in Central Europe. Schroeder claimed that 1914 was a \"preventive war\" forced on Germany to maintain Austria as a power, which was faced with a crippling British \"encirclement policy\" aimed at the break-up of that state.\n\n[5] Historiography of World War II: There are different perspectives on the causes of the war; the three most prominent are the Orthodox from the 1950s, Revisionist from the 1970s, and Post-Revisionism which offers the most contemporary perspective. The orthodox perspective arose during the aftermath of the war. The main historian noted for this perspective is Hugh Trevor-Roper. Orthodox historians argue that Hitler was a master planner who intentionally started World War II due to his strong beliefs on fascism, expansionism, and the supremacy of the German State. Revisionist historians argue that it was an ordinary war by world standards and that Hitler was an opportunist of the sort who commonly appears in world history; he merely took advantage of the opportunities given to him. This viewpoint became popular in the 1970s, especially in the revisionism of A. J. P. Taylor. Throughout the course of the war, orthodox historians argue as if the Axis powers were a sort of evil consuming the world with their powerful message and malignant ideology, while the Allied powers were trying to protect democracy and freedom. Post-revisionist historians of the causes, such as Alan Bullock, argue that the cause of the War was a matter of both the evil and the banal. Essentially Hitler was a strategist with clear aims and objectives, that would not have been achievable without taking advantage of the opportunities given to him. Each perspective of World War\n\n[6] Causes of World War II: Among the causes of World War II were Italian fascism in the 1920s, Japanese militarism and invasion of China in the 1930s, and especially the political takeover in 1933 of Germany by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party and its aggressive foreign policy. The immediate cause was Germany invading Poland on September 1, 1939, and Britain and France declaring war on Germany on September 3, 1939.\n\n[7] Historiography of the causes of World War I: In the 1960s two theories emerged to explain the causes of World War I. One championed by the West German historian Andreas Hillgruber argued that in 1914, a \"calculated risk\" on the part of Berlin had gone awry. Hillgruber argued that what the Imperial German government had attempted to do in 1914 was to break the informal Triple Entente of Russia, France and Britain by encouraging Austria-Hungary to invade Serbia and thus provoke a crisis in an area that would concern only St. Petersburg. Hillgruber argued that the Germans hoped that both Paris and London would decide the crisis in the Balkans did not concern them and that lack of Anglo-French support would lead the Russians to reach an understanding with Germany. Hillgruber argued that when the Austrian attack on Serbia caused Russia to mobilize instead of backing down, the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg under strong pressure from a hawkish General Staff led by General Moltke the Younger panicked and ordered the Schlieffen Plan to be activated, thus leading to a German attack on France. In Hillgruber’s opinion the German government had pursued a high-risk diplomatic strategy of provoking a war in the Balkans that had inadvertently caused a world war.\n\n[8] Recycling: Recycling (or \"salvage\", as it was then usually known) was a major issue for governments throughout World War II. Financial constraints and significant material shortages due to war efforts made it necessary for countries to reuse goods and recycle materials. These resource shortages caused by the world wars, and other such world-changing occurrences, greatly encouraged recycling. The struggles of war claimed much of the material resources available, leaving little for the civilian population. It became necessary for most homes to recycle their waste, as recycling offered an extra source of materials allowing people to make the most of what was available to them. Recycling household materials meant more resources for war efforts and a better chance of victory. Massive government promotion campaigns, such as the National Salvage Campaign in Britain and the Salvage for Victory campaign in the United States, were carried out on the home front in every combative nation, urging citizens to donate metal, paper, rags, and rubber as a matter of patriotism.\n\n[9] Civilian casualty ratio: According to most sources, World War II was the most lethal war in world history, with some 70 million killed in six years. The civilian to combatant fatality ratio in World War II lies somewhere between 3:2 and 2:1, or from 60% to 67%. The high ratio of civilian casualties in this war was due in part to the increasing effectiveness and lethality of strategic weapons which were used to target enemy industrial or population centers, and famines caused by economic disruption. An estimated 2.1–3 million Indians died in the Bengal famine of 1943 in British India during World War II. A substantial number of civilians in this war were also deliberately killed by Axis Powers as a result of racial policies (for example, the Holocaust) or ethnic cleansing campaigns.\n\n[10] Post–World War II economic expansion: Among the causes can be mentioned the rapid normalization of political relations between former Axis powers and the western Allies. After the war, the major powers were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression, some of which were ascribed to post–World War I policy errors. The Marshall Plan for the rebuilding of Europe is most credited for reconciliation, though the immediate post-war situations was more complicated. In 1948 the Marshall Plan pumped over $12 billion to rebuild and modernize Western Europe. The European Coal and Steel Community formed the foundation of what was to become the European Union in later years.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWhat is the cause of World War 2?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It destroyed Morval and nearby villages.\n\n[2] Battle of Morval: The British plan was for an advance to the final objective set for the attacks of during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. The ground to be taken was on the east side of Bazentin ridge, which ran north-west from the Somme to a hollow facing north-east with Combles at the west end, the hollow running towards Rocquigny beyond the Péronne–Bapaume road. North of the hollow the ridge continued through Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, then the Albert–Bapaume road, west of Le Sars to Thiepval. Spurs ran down the eastern slope, generally to the north-east in the direction of the Péronne–Bapaume road, before the ground rose again from St Pierre Vaast Wood to Sailly-Saillisel, Le Transloy, Beaulencourt and Thilloy.\n\n[3] Battle of Morval: The Battle of Morval, 25–28 September 1916, was an attack during the Battle of the Somme by the British Fourth Army on the villages of Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesbœufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The main British attack was postponed, to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on the village of Combles south of Morval, to close up to the German defences between Moislains and Le Transloy, near the Péronne–Bapaume road (N 17). The combined attack from the Somme river northwards to Martinpuich on the Albert–Bapaume road, was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. The postponement was extended from because of rain, which affected operations more frequently during September.\n\n[4] Battle of the Somme: The Battle of Morval was an attack by the Fourth Army on Morval, Gueudecourt and Lesboeufs held by the German 1st Army, which had been the final objectives of the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The attack was postponed to combine with attacks by the French Sixth Army on Combles, south of Morval and because of rain. The combined attack was also intended to deprive the German defenders further west, near Thiepval of reinforcements, before an attack by the Reserve Army, due on 26 September. Combles, Morval, Lesboeufs and Gueudecourt were captured and a small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon. Many casualties were inflicted on the Germans but the French made slower progress. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a salient near Combles. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge.\n\n[5] Battle of Morval: North of the 56th Division, the 95th Brigade of the 5th Division was delayed by enfilade machine-gun fire from the embankment north of the tram line and a strong point on the Ginchy–Morval road until bombed from the north. On the left the 15th Brigade followed the creeping barrage closely down into the valley, over-running and taking prisoner numerous Germans. The 95th Brigade resumed its advance up the far slope and rushed the German trench running south from Morval, as the 15th Brigade overran the trench further north, west of the village, taking many more prisoners. After another halt to reorganise, the village was occupied by the 15th Brigade at . The final objective from the windmill, south to the 56th Division area, was consolidated by nightfall. Several weak German counter-attacks were defeated and the 95th Brigade began working its way southward, towards the French at Frégicourt. The 6th Division attacked from north of Morval, to the road through the middle of Lesbœufs, on the left of the 5th Division. The first objective was taken by a battalion of the 16th Brigade on the right and two battalions of the 18th Brigade on the left. The final objective east of the Morval–Lesbœufs road was captured by two battalions leapfrogging through on the right and one on the left, to clear the south end of Lesbœufs, where the Guard Division was met as it occupied\n\n[6] Battle of Morval: An advance on the main front of the British attack of was to be made in stages. The first step was an advance to the third of the objective lines set for 15 September and to the Gird Trenches () south of Gueudecourt, beginning at The second objective was a line along the sunken road running from Combles to Gueudecourt, west of Morval and Lesbœufs, then over a spur south-east of Gueudecourt and through the centre of the village, beginning at The final objective was on the east side of Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt, the advance to begin at with the objectives to be reached by\n\n[7] Battle of Morval: Anglo-French attacks had been expected on 23 September, rather than 25 September and the timing of the attack for the afternoon, also wrong-footed some of the defenders. The 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions of the XXVI Reserve Corps were quickly pushed back, part of the 236th Reserve Regiment being \"destroyed\" at the tram line north of Bouleaux Wood. Parts of the 235th Reserve Regiment west of Combles and the 234th Reserve Regiment in the village, were threatened with encirclement by the British from the north and the French in the south. A battalion of the 239th Reserve Regiment of the 52nd Reserve Division was cut off in Morval and part of the regiment was overwhelmed north of the village near Lesbœufs. The rest of Lesbœufs, held by the 240th Reserve Regiment from the same division fell easily. Parts of the 51st and 52nd Reserve divisions counter-attacked Morval but were only able to advance a short distance and cover the withdrawal of their artillery, eventually forming new a line along the Le Transloy road east of Morval.\n\n[8] Capture of Gueudecourt: The cavalry patrols which moved past Gueudecourt to scout the ground towards Ligny Thilloy and Le Transloy had been forced to dismount but the German defence was in disorder, suggesting that an opportunity to exploit the situation with cavalry was close. The depth of advance and relatively light British casualties during the Battle of Morval was partly due to the improvement of the tactical methods in the Fourth Army, particularly in infantry–artillery co-operation. Prior and Wilson called the battle an \"outstanding success\", although they attributed this to accident more than design. The German defenders had been forced out of their prepared defences and had to fight in improvised positions but had still managed to withdraw all but two field guns. The Fourth Army divisions were so tired, that they could do no more than advance to regain contact with the Germans\n\n[9] Battle of Morval: Monday 25 September, was bright and cloudless, with a ground haze but reports from observers in contact patrol aircraft were notably accurate, as the infantry advanced to their objectives on the Fourth Army front, from Morval to Gueudecourt and around Flers. Observers in reconnaissance aircraft located artillery batteries; engaged and by zone calls. At observers watched the advance to the final objective and after twenty-one minutes, almost all of it was reported captured. A map compiled from air reports was later shown to be more accurate than infantry progress reports. The ground not taken near Morval fell in the evening, completing the capture of the ground on the main ridge, making Combles untenable, although British balloon observers were able to see that the French advance from the south had been delayed. There was extensive German air activity during the day but most aircraft flew above , which few British aircraft could reach.\n\n[10] Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson: By late September, superior British artillery and better tactics enabled the British to achieve a striking success in the Battle of Morval. At the start of October, however, the rain and the temperature both fell, the battlefield turned into a quagmire.

Perth Children's Hospital is the state's only specialist children's hospital, and Graylands Hospital is the only public stand-alone psychiatric teaching hospital. Most of these are public hospitals, with some operating under public-private partnerships. St John of God Murdoch Hospital is privately owned and operated.\n\n[2] 2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase: 2-hydroxypropyl-CoM lyase (, \"epoxyalkane:coenzyme M transferase\", \"epoxyalkane:CoM transferase\", \"epoxyalkane:2-mercaptoethanesulfonate transferase\", \"coenzyme M-epoxyalkane ligase\", \"epoxyalkyl:CoM transferase\", \"epoxypropane:coenzyme M transferase\", \"epoxypropyl:CoM transferase\", \"EaCoMT\", \"2-hydroxypropyl-CoM:2-mercaptoethanesulfonate lyase (epoxyalkane-ring-forming)\", \"(R)-2-hydroxypropyl-CoM 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate lyase (cyclizing\", \"(R)-1,2-epoxypropane-forming)\") is an enzyme with systematic name \"(R)-(or (S)-)2-hydroxypropyl-CoM:2-mercaptoethanesulfonate lyase (epoxyalkane-ring-forming)\". This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction\n\n[3] Perth: Perth is divided into 30 local government areas and 250 suburbs, stretching from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south, and east inland to The Lakes. Outside of the main CBD, important urban centres within Perth include Fremantle and Joondalup. Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. Mandurah, Western Australia's second-largest city, has in recent years formed a conurbation with Perth along the coast, though for most purposes it is still considered a separate city. \"marker-size\": \"large\", }\n\n[4] Perth River: The Perth River is a river located in the Southern Alps in the West Coast region of New Zealand's South Island. Its source is in terrace icefields north of the Rangitata Divide and is joined by multiple tributaries, including a creek from Abel Lake. It features a number of rapids and passes through two gorges before meeting the Whataroa River. The river is largely inaccessible, but recently, an adventure tourism company has begun offering \"heli-rafting\" on the river: whitewater rafters are flown in by helicopter to raft the river. Kayakers have been flying (\"heli-boating\") up the Perth for a number of years. The normal rafting put in at Five-Finger stream gives a nice class III-IV run with one amazing gorge. By flying up to Scone Hut, the trip becomes one of the best IV-V runs on the coast. More recently paddlers have been flying or walking upstream of scone hut for some V-V+ excitement.\n\n[5] Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency): The Perth and Kinross constituency was largely a replacement for the Perth and East Perthshire constituency. As first used in the 1983 general election, it covered part of the region of Tayside, which had been created in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, as a region of three districts, including the district of Perth and Kinross. In 1997 the Perth and Kinross constituency was largely replaced by the Perth constituency.\n\n[6] Tensta Konsthall: Recent exhibitions at Tensta konsthall include • “Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies,” with Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Goldin+Senneby, Wade Guyton, Mai-Thu Perret, Walid Raad, and Haegue Yang, among others • “Kami, Khokha, Bert and Ernie: World Heritage” by Hinrich Sachs • “Doing what you want: Marie-Louise Ekman accompanied by Sister Corita Kent, Mladen Stilinović, and Martha Wilson” • “The Society without qualities” with Sören Andreasen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Sture Johannesson, Sharon Lockhardt, and Palle Nielsen (part of “The new model” and curated by Lars Bang Larsen) • “Working With...” by Zak Kyes • “We are continuing BBDG” with Bernd Krauss • “Two Archives” by Babak Afrassiabi and Nasrin Tabatabai\n\n[7] West Perth, Ontario: West Perth is a municipality in Ontario, Canada, situated in Western Perth County, just west of the city of Stratford. In 2016, its population was 8,865 in a land area of 579.36 square kilometers. The former town of Mitchell and townships of Logan, Hibbert, and Fullarton all amalgamated into this single large municipality on January 1, 1998. Municipal offices, administration, and services are based in Mitchell. The mayor is Walter McKenzie.\n\n[8] Perth: Another more recent wave of arrivals includes white minorities from Southern Africa. South African residents overtook those born in Italy as the fourth largest foreign group in 2001. By 2006, there were 18,825 South Africans residing in Perth, accounting for 1.3% of the city's population. Many Afrikaners and Anglo-Africans emigrated to Perth during the 1980s and 1990s, with the phrase \"packing for Perth\" becoming associated with South Africans who choose to emigrate abroad, sometimes regardless of the destination. As a result, the city has been described as \"the Australian capital of South Africans in exile\". The reason for Perth's popularity among white South Africans has often been attributed to the location, the vast amount of land, and the slightly warmer climate compared to other large Australian cities – Perth has a Mediterranean climate reminiscent of Cape Town.\n\n[9] Perth East, Ontario: Ellice Swamp is a large woodlot in Perth County, Ontario. The swamp covers approximately 856 hectares (2,115 acres). It is located between Stratford and Milverton in the northeastern portion of the Thames River Watershed, between the North Branch of the Thames and the Nith River. Historically, it was known as Ellice Huckleberry Swamp and was part of the Huron Tract administered by the Canada Company. It is primarily owned by the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority.\n\n[10] Colonial Town Plans of Perth: The town plan also shows the influence of Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia. Founded in 1699, this city was a model for many subsequent colonial capitals. Grid patterns had been appearing quite early in the towns of North and South America, but these were based on the Iberian model of a perfect square. Historian Felicity Morel-Edniebrown suggests that Williamsburg introduced the feature of a long, broad street with key buildings terminating its vistas. Like Perth, the centre of the town was also dominated by a large open space known as Market Square. This square separated the town into two large rectangles, east and west, as the Barracks did in Perth. Also, like Williamsburg, Perth was conceived as the capital of a large and productive hinterland, within which the administrative, institutional, and religious powers of the state resided, where a colonial gentry could maintain social and business ties. That this was the intention was well understood, as reflected by the comments of the naval surgeon T.B. Wilson, who visited Perth briefly in October 1829, and described the intended future of the main street:\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following questions based on the given contexts:\n\n1.

As a result, Roman Numeral I indicates the first year of the republic, that is, the year before the calendar actually came into use. By law, the beginning of each year was set at midnight, beginning on the day the apparent autumnal equinox falls at the Paris Observatory.\n\n[2] 1989: 1989 marked the beginning of the current Heisei period in Japan. It is also the latest year, when written in Roman numerals, to have an L.\n\n[3] AD 89: AD 89 (LXXXIX) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Fulvus and Atratinus (or, less frequently, year 842 \"Ab urbe condita\"). The denomination AD 89 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\n[4] Roman numerals: Capital or small capital Roman numerals are widely used in Romance languages to denote , e.g. the French ' and the Spanish ' mean \"18th century\". Slavic languages in and adjacent to Russia similarly favour Roman numerals (). On the other hand, in Slavic languages in Central Europe, like most Germanic languages, one writes \"18.\" (with a period) before the local word for \"century\". Mixed Roman and Arabic numerals are sometimes used in numeric representations of dates (especially in formal letters and official documents, but also on tombstones). The is written in Roman numerals, while the day is in Arabic numerals: \"14..1789\" and \".14.1789\" both refer unambiguously to 14 June 1789. Roman numerals are sometimes used to represent the in hours-of-operation signs displayed in windows or on doors of businesses, and also sometimes in railway and bus timetables. Monday, taken as the first day of the week, is represented by . Sunday is represented by . The hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in Roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time. In the example case (left), the business opens from 10 am to 7 pm on weekdays, 10 AM to 5 pm on Saturdays and is closed on Sundays. Note that the listing uses 24-hour time. Roman numerals may also be used for floor numbering. For instance, apartments in central\n\n[5] Tuttle Silver Company: Under the crescent is a Roman numeral, which may indicate, either in what term of the presidency it was produced, or - by some accounts – it stands for the exact year of the presidency it was produced.\n\n[6] History of mathematics: Leonardo of Pisa, now known as Fibonacci, serendipitously learned about the Hindu–Arabic numerals on a trip to what is now Béjaïa, Algeria with his merchant father. (Europe was still using Roman numerals.) There, he observed a system of arithmetic (specifically algorism) which due to the positional notation of Hindu–Arabic numerals was much more efficient and greatly facilitated commerce. Leonardo wrote \"Liber Abaci\" in 1202 (updated in 1254) introducing the technique to Europe and beginning a long period of popularizing it. The book also brought to Europe what is now known as the Fibonacci sequence (known to Indian mathematicians for hundreds of years before that) which was used as an unremarkable example within the text.\n\n[7] September (Roman month): September (from Latin \"septem\", \"seven\") or mensis September was originally the seventh of ten months on the ancient Roman calendar that began with March (\"mensis Martius\", \"Mars' month\"). It had 29 days. After the reforms that resulted in a 12-month year, September became the ninth month, but retained its name. September followed what was originally Sextilis, the \"sixth\" month, renamed \"Augustus\" in honor of the first Roman emperor, and preceded October, the \"eighth\" month that like September retained its numerical name contrary to its position on the calendar. A day was added to September in the mid-40s BC as part of the Julian calendar reform.\n\n[8] Roman Republican currency: By about 140 BC (the exact date is unclear) the denarius was retariffed to 16 \"asses\", indicated by XVI on the obverse of the denarius. This appears first on the coinage marked L.IVLI (Crawford 224/1), commonly dated to 141 BC. The clear marking with the number XVI was soon again replaced with an X, but often now with a horizontal bar through the centre as shown in the second example on the left (Crawford 243/1); this is sometimes read as a monogram of XVI with all the letters superimposed. The re-tariffing is thought to have been a recognition of a relationship that had developed because of decreased \"as\" weights, both due to wear of old \"asses\" and to decreasing mint weights of newer ones. This meant that the quinarius was worth eight \"asses\", and the sestertius four \"asses\". The new denarius-to-\"as\" ratio lasted for hundreds of years. At about the same time the unit of account changed from \"asses\" to sestertii (HS). This may well be an indicator of inflation.\n\n[9] The Roman Revolution: The Roman Revolution (1939) is a scholarly study of the final years of the ancient Roman Republic and the creation of the Roman Empire by Caesar Augustus. The book was the work of Sir Ronald Syme (1903–1989), a noted Tacitean scholar, and was published by the Oxford University Press. It was immediately controversial. Its main conclusion was that the structure of the Republic and its Senate were inadequate to the needs of Roman rule, and that Augustus was merely doing what was necessary to restore order in public life. This was a situation and reasoning uncomfortably reminiscent of contemporary events in Nazi Germany and the other fascist regimes of the time.\n\n[10] Astronomical naming conventions: Until 1994, the systematic naming of comets (the \"Old Style\") involved first giving them a provisional designation of the year of their discovery followed by a lower case letter indicating its order of discovery in that year (e.g. the first Comet Bennett is 1969i, the 9th comet discovered in 1969). In 1987, more than 26 comets were discovered, so the alphabet was used again with a \"1\" subscript, very much like what is still done with asteroids (an example is Comet Skorichenko–George, 1989e1). The record year was 1989, which went as high as 1989h1. Once an orbit had been established, the comet was given a permanent designation in order of time of perihelion passage, consisting of the year followed by a Roman numeral. For example, Comet Bennett (1969i) became 1970 II.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [3] AD 89.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Although no parent club was 'officially' recognised at the time, in September 1924 the South African Kennel Union began taking \"lion dog\" registrations. In February 1926, SAKU (KUSA) officially recognised the Rhodesian Parent Club. At the behest of Barnes, SAKU also made two changes at this time:On this second point Barnes was emphatic, stating \"I am breeding a gundog.\" The Rhodesian Ridgeback remained classified as a gundog for over 20 years thence. Although the Rhodesian Ridgeback's bird hunting prowess has been well known throughout the breed's history (the original description from the South African parent club belabors this point in fact), it is important to note that the \"gundog\" classification made in 1920s Southern Rhodesia and South Africa was not specifically about bird hunting. To understand this it is necessary to understand the union's classification system at that time. The two likely categories Barnes could have chosen from within the SAKU classification system at that time were, \"sporting\" and \"gundog\". In the \"sporting\" group were the sighthounds and scenthounds. In the \"gundog\" group were the birddogs. This raises the question why Barnes rejected the group containing the sighthounds and \n\n[2] Ridgeback (brand): Ridgeback’s story started in 1983, when founder Errol Drew created the first UK mountain bike. Drew first spotted a mountain bike at the 1982 New York Bike Show, where he declared it “the future of cycling.”\n\n[3] Rhodesian Ridgeback: The original breed standard for the Rhodesian Lion Dog was drafted in 1922 by F. R. Barnes on founding the first Ridgeback Club at a Bulawayo Kennel Club show, then in Southern Rhodesia (now in Zimbabwe), and based on that of the Dalmatian. In 1927, Barnes' standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union with the name amended to Rhodesian Ridgeback. Outside the subcontinent and internationally, the first Rhodesian Ridgebacks in Britain were shown by Mrs. Edward Foljambe in 1928. In 1950, Mr. and Mrs. William H. O'Brien of Arizona brought six carefully selected Ridgebacks to the US from South Africa. He and his wife and Margaret Lowthian of California began the process of getting the breed accepted by the American Kennel Club. Similarly, in 1952, The Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain was founded at Crufts to promote the breed around the United Kingdom to show judges, so a standard for the breed might be recognised. In 1954 the first Challenge Certificates were awarded to dogs shown as Rhodesian Ridgebacks at United Kingdom competitions, toward their subsequent recognition by The Kennel Club of Great Britain, and in 1955 the American Kennel Club recognised the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed as a member of the hound group.\n\n[4] UOIT Ridgebacks: The Ridgebacks rowing team was first established in 2005 and currently operate out of Durham Rowing Club in Port Perry, Ontario. Currently the team competes in Ontario level regattas during the months of September and October. The team fields both men's and women's rowing at both novice and varsity levels.\n\n[5] Kromfohrländer: The Kromfohrlander was first recognized by FCI for showing in 1955. The Kromfohrlander came to Scandinavia starting in the early 1970s. The first smooth Kromfohrlander came to North America from Germany in 1997 when he was 2 years old. He sired the first smooth Kromfohrlander litter born in the USA in 2000. He sired a second smooth Kromfohrlander litter in 2004. Each litter produced 2 puppies, all of which were kept by the breeders and none of whom reproduced. The first rough Kromfohrlander came to North America (USA) from Luxembourg in 1993, but was never bred. No other Kromfohrlanders brought to North America between 2004–2016 were ever bred, and no Kromfohrlander of either coat type has ever otherwise been bred to any other dog of any breed in North America. The Kromfohrlander was admitted to American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS) in 2012.\n\n[6] Racking Horse: The ancestors of the Racking Horse were first bred on southern plantations prior to the American Civil War. They could be ridden comfortably for hours because of their smooth, natural gait. They were also bred for a good disposition, intelligence, and versatility. Their development was similar to that and in some cases linked to that of the Tennessee Walking Horse, also popular in the southeastern US. In the late 1800s, horse shows became increasingly popular in the southeastern United States, as an alternative to the gambling associated with horse racing. Racking Horses were most commonly seen at small shows, although they were also seen at some larger ones. They did not have their own breed association, however, and were often shown as a type of Tennessee Walking Horse.\n\n[7] Rhodesian Ridgeback: By the 1860s, European colonisers had also imported a variety of mainly European dog breeds to this area of Africa, including such dedicated hunting dogs as Great Danes, Bloodhounds, Greyhounds, and terriers. Genetic analysis indicates that there has been admixture between the Great Dane and the Ridgeback, indicating the Dane's major contribution. These breeds were bred with the indigenous African dogs, including the dog of the Khoikhoi people, which resulted in the Boer hunting dogs, generically called names such as \"boerhund\" (Boer hound) in Dutch then its descendant language of Afrikaans, which are the chief forerunners to the modern Rhodesian Ridgeback.\" Other breeds came from Arabian traders around the Horn of Africa and with Asian immigrants, particularly into the Cape Colony, and jackal coursing introduced from British India brought lurchers from England and Ireland and the borzoi or Russian wolfhound, and before the era of standardised modern breeds, several breeds may have more rarely contributed to Rhodesian Ridgeback genetics.\n\n[8] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H. Cockrum, Foram’s founder, chairman and CEO. “We wanted the most efficient office building ever designed, with no wasted space or wasted energy. This is a building of the future more than a building of the present. A lot of love has gone into that building, and a lot of pride.\"\n\n[9] Rhodesian Ridgeback: Traditionally, many ridgeback puppies were culled at birth for numerous reasons, including ridgelessness. Contemporary breeders are increasingly opting for surgical sterilisation of these offspring to ensure they will not be bred but can live into maturity as non-showing, non-breeding pets. Some breed parent clubs and canine registries in Europe have even made the culling of ridgeless whelps a requirement. It was pointed out on the BBC One investigative documentary \"Pedigree Dogs Exposed\" that the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain's \"code of ethics\", which is ratified annually by the kennel club states that \"Ridgeless puppies shall be culled\", and that \"mismarked\" puppies will only ever be sold on condition that they are never shown, and are neutered. The Ridgeback Club defended itself pointing to the statement that follows, \"if a breeder finds this morally impossible [to cull the puppy] the puppy shall be homed...\" as indication that culling is not mandatory, but preferred. It was only after the publicity surrounding the promotion of culling that they reversed their code of ethics to say \"no healthy puppy will be culled\".\n\n[10] Rhodesian Ridgeback: Reverend Charles Helm (1844–1915), son of Reverend Daniel Helm of the London Missionary Society, was born in the Cape Colony, joined the London Missionary Society himself, and moved from the Zuurbraak (now Suurbraak) mission station just east of Swellendam (modern Western Cape Province, South Africa) to the Hope Fountain Mission in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, travelling from October 1874 to December 1875, then bringing two ridged dog bitches from somewhere between Kimberley (modern Northern Cape Province, South Africa) and Swellendam with him to Hope Fountain in 1879 en route to becoming, as it would turn out, a political advisor to King Lobengula, house-host to hunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, postmaster of Bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor. At Hope Fountain, now part of the city of Bulawayo, fellow South African transplant Cornelis van Rooyen (b. 1860, Uitenhage, modern Eastern Cape Province, South Africa), a big–game hunter, was married to Maria Vermaak of Bloemhof by Reverend Helm in 1879 the same year Helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the Mission. Van Rooyen saw Helm's pair of bitches and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities. It is not known if these two first direct ancestors of Rhodesian Ridgebacks had dorsal hair pattern ridges themselves, but they founded the Rhodesian Ridge\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\n\nNo answer is present in the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The series premiered on iTunes in 2008 with the support of the Schulz estate. The first season consists of 20 cartoon shorts, paired into 10 episodes. The episodes employ signature themes and plotlines from the classic strips. The first season was released to DVD on March 9, 2010. Animation production was done by Studio B Productions.\n\n[2] Peanuts: The December 1997 issue of \"The Comics Journal\" featured an extensive collection of testimonials to \"Peanuts.\" Over 40 cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared reflections on the power and influence of Schulz's art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote, \"\"Peanuts\" was and still is for me a revelation. It's mostly from \"Peanuts\" where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in \"Love and Rockets\". Schulz's characters, the humor, the insight ... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel ...\" Tom Batiuk wrote: \"The influence of Charles Schulz on the craft of cartooning is so pervasive it is almost taken for granted.\" Batiuk also described the depth of emotion in \"Peanuts\": \"Just beneath the cheerful surface were vulnerabilities and anxieties that we all experienced, but were reluctant to acknowledge. By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.\"\n\n[3] The Peanuts Movie: Scott Mendelson from \"Forbes\" was more critical of the film, saying there was \"nothing objectively wrong with \"The Peanuts Movie\"\", but as he personally was not a fan of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip, that made him \"anti-Charlie Brown\", loathing each time Charlie Brown failed in the film. Joe McGovern from \"Entertainment Weekly\" was also not as receptive, giving the film a grade of C+, and criticizing the animation, stating, \"Even if you assume that Schulz always wanted his frozen pond reflecting lustrous light and Snoopy frolicking in a lavish Hayao Miyazaki world, the animation steroids injected into the aesthetic here nonetheless shrivel the great melancholy that's so key to the comic's endurance\".\n\n[4] Peanuts: In 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily \"Peanuts\" strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on Leap Day in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page. Later in the '90s, Schulz abandoned the characters Patty, Violet, Pigpen and Franklin.\n\n[5] Peanuts: \"Peanuts\" continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of \"The Complete Peanuts\", the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and Peanuts Motion Comics. Additionally, BOOM! Studios has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.\n\n[6] Peanuts: Peanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz that ran from October 2, 1950, to February 13, 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. \"Peanuts\" is among the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with 17,897 strips published in all, making it \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being\". At its peak in the mid- to late 1960s, \"Peanuts\" ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of around 355 million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages. It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States, and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion.\n\n[7] Peanuts: Cartoon tributes have appeared in other comic strips since Schulz's death in 2000 and are now displayed at the Charles Schulz Museum. In May 2000, many cartoonists included a reference to \"Peanuts\" in their strips. Originally planned as a tribute to Schulz's retirement, after his death that February it became a tribute to his life and career. Similarly, on October 30, 2005, several comic strips again included references to \"Peanuts\" and specifically the \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" television special.\n\n[8] Charles M. Schulz: Later that year, Schulz approached United Feature Syndicate with the one-panel series \"Li'l Folks\", and the syndicate became interested. By that time Schulz had also developed a comic strip, usually using four panels rather than one, and to Schulz's delight, the syndicate preferred that version. \"Peanuts\" made its first appearance on October 2, 1950, in seven newspapers. The weekly Sunday page debuted on January 6, 1952. After a slow start, \"Peanuts\" eventually became one of the most popular comic strips of all time, as well as one of the most influential. Schulz also had a short-lived sports-oriented comic strip, \"It's Only a Game\" (1957–59), but he abandoned it after the success of \"Peanuts\". From 1956 to 1965 he contributed a single-panel strip, \"Young Pillars\", featuring teenagers, to \"Youth\", a publication associated with the Church of God.\n\n[9] Peanuts: Charles Schulz had always resisted republication of the earliest \"Peanuts\" strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them. However, in 1997 he began talks with Fantagraphics Books to have the entire run of the strip, which would end up with 17,897 strips total, published chronologically in book form. In addition to the post-millennium Peanuts publications are BOOM! Studios restyling of the comics and activity books, and \"First Appearances\" series. Its content is produced by Peanuts Studio, subsequently an arm of Peanuts Worldwide LLC.\n\n[10] Zombie strip: The practice of continuing a zombie comic strip is commonly criticized by cartoonists, particularly younger ones in the new generation, including Bill Watterson and Stephan Pastis. Pastis addressed the issue in his strip, \"Pearls Before Swine\", in 2005. Mark Tatulli also commented on zombie strips in his strip \"Liō\" in 2010. and in 2013. After an incident in which United Feature Syndicate secretly retained the services of superhero comic artist Al Plastino to continue the comic strip \"Peanuts\" in case of an interruption, Charles Schulz, author and creator of \"Peanuts\", requested that his strip (which, in contrast to most comic strips today, he drew completely on his own with no assistants of any kind) not be continued by another cartoonist after his death; Schulz's family (as well as Universal Uclick, which currently holds the strip's publication rights) has honored his wishes. Since Schulz's death in 2000, \"Peanuts\" has continued in reruns under the title \"Classic Peanuts\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [6].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Bates helped settle an ongoing debate among linguists who argued that a referential language style, characterized by the child's first 50 words containing mostly object labels, was a better strategy in developing language than a personal and socially expressive language style. She found that regardless of the strategy applied by the child, they learn words at the same rate. She did, however, find strong predictive power in the child’s vocabulary at 13 and 20 months old and their grammatical complexity at 2 years old. Bates finds that language learning comes from the neural plasticity in the brain; therefore, children can and are able to learn a language, even with brain trauma. Research in her lab also showed that adult aphasic patients' deficits were not specific to linguistic structures theorized to be localized to specific brain areas, nor were they restricted to the linguistic domain. Lesion sites overlap in the role that they affect speech fluency and complexity. Language is dependent upon basic cognitive processes such as memory, pattern recognition, and spreading activation. This perspective runs counter to the theory of Noam Chomsky, Eric Lenneberg, and Steven Pinker that language is a special stimulus that is processed by specific language modules in the mind such as the local\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [4].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please provide the answer to the question \"How many seconds are in a day?\".", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [4].\n\nThe answer to the question \"How many seconds are in a day?\" is present in context [4], which mentions that the proofreader randomly selects proofs to re-read while outside the department", "flan-t5-xxl": "I don't know", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.", "Orca-2-7b": "Yes, answer is present", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "Yes, answer is present"}}

Abu Muslim was famously challenged by the Goldsmith of Merv to do the right thing and not make war on fellow Muslims. The Goldsmith was put to death.\n\n[2] Merv: Throughout the Abbasid era (750-1258), Merv remained the capital and most important city of Khurasan. During this time, the Arab historian Al-Muqaddasi (c. 945/946 - 991) called Merv \"delightful, fine, elegant, brilliant, extensive, and pleasant\". Merv's architecture perhaps provided the inspiration for the Abbasid re-planning of Baghdad. The city was notable as a home for immigrants from the Arab lands as well as for those from Sogdia and elsewhere in Central Asia (Herrmann 1999). In the period from 813 to 818, the temporary residency of the caliph al-Ma'mun effectively made Merv the capital of the Muslim world and highlighted Merv's importance to the Abbasids. Merv also became the center of a major 8th-century Neo-Mazdakite movement led by al-Muqanna, the \"Veiled Prophet\", who gained many followers by claiming to be an incarnation of God and heir to Abu Muslim; the Khurramiyya inspired by him persisted in Merv until the 12th century.\n\n[3] Merv: In 1505 the Uzbeks occupied Merv; five years later Shah Ismail, the founder of the Safavid dynasty of Persia, expelled them. In this period a Persian nobleman restored a large dam (the 'Soltanbent') on the river Murghab, and the settlement which grew up in the area thus irrigated became known as \"Baýramaly\", as referenced in some 19th-century texts. Merv remained in the hands of Persia (except for periods of Uzbek rule between 1524 and 1528 and again between 1588 and 1598) until 1785, when Shah Murad, the Emir of Bokhara, captured the city. A few years later, in 1788 and 1789, the Bukharan Manghit king, Shah Murad Beg razed the city to the ground, broke down the dams, and converted the district into a waste. The entire population of the city and the surrounding oasis of about 100,000 were then deported in several stages to the Bukharan oasis and Samarkand region in the Zarafshan Valley. Being nearly all Azerbaijani Turkish-speaking Shi'as from the Izzeddinlu branch of Qajar tribe, the deportees resisted assimilation into the Sunni population of Bukhara, despite the common language they spoke with most Bukharan natives. These Marvis survive — Soviet censuses listed them as \"Iranis/Iranians\" through the 1980s. They live in Samarkand as well as in Bu\n\n[4] Merv: Alexander the Great's visit to Merv is merely legendary, but the city was named Alexandria (Ἀλεξάνδρεια) after him for a time. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Merv became the capital of the Province of Margiana of the Seleucid, Greco-Bactrian (256-125 BC), Parthian, and Sassanid states. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus Soter (reigned 281–261 BC) renamed Merv as Antiochia Margiana; he rebuilt and expanded the city at the site presently known as Gyaur Gala (Gäwürgala) fortress. After the fall of the Seleucid dynasty (63 BC), Bactria, Parthia, and the Kushans took control in succession. Merv was a major city of Buddhist learning, with Buddhist monastery temples for many centuries until its Islamicization. At the site of Gyaur Kala and Bairam Ali Buddhism was followed and practised often at the local Buddhist stupas.\n\n[5] Merv: During this period Merv, like Samarkand and Bukhara, functioned as one of the great cities of Muslim scholarship; the celebrated historian Yaqut (1179–1229) studied in its libraries. Merv produced a number of scholars in various branches of knowledge, such as Islamic law, hadith, history, and literature. Several scholars have the name Marwazi (المروزي) designating them as hailing from Merv, including the famous Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (780–855). The city continued to have a substantial Christian community. In 1009 the Archbishop of Merv sent a letter to the Patriarch at Baghdad asking that the Keraites be allowed to fast less than other Nestorian Christians.\n\n[6] Merv: In 1037, the Seljuks, a clan of Oghuz Turks moving from the steppes east of the Aral Sea, peacefully took over Merv under the leadership of Toghril Beg—the Ghaznavid sultan Masud was extremely unpopular in the city. Togrul's brother Çagry stayed in Merv as the Seljuk domains grew to include the rest of Khurasan and Iran, and it subsequently became a favorite city of the Seljuk leadership. Alp Arslan (Sultan: 1063-1072) and his descendant Sultan Sanjar (died 1157) were both buried at Merv.\n\n[7] Merv (East Syriac Ecclesiastical Province): By the eleventh century East Syriac Christianity was in decline in Khorasan and Segestan. The last-known metropolitan of Merv was Abdisho, who was consecrated by the patriarch Mari (987–99). The last-known metropolitan of Herat was Giwargis, who flourished in the reign of Sabrisho III (1064–72). If any of the suffragan dioceses were still in existence at this period, they are not mentioned. The surviving urban Christian communities in Khorasan suffered a heavy blow at the start of the thirteenth century, when the cities of Merv, Nishapur and Herat were stormed by Genghis Khan in 1220. Their inhabitants were massacred, and although all three cities were refounded shortly afterwards, it is likely that they had only small East Syriac communities thereafter. Nevertheless, at least one diocese survived into the thirteenth century. In 1279 an unnamed bishop of Tus entertained the monks Bar Sawma and Marqos in the monastery of Mar Sehyon near Tus during their pilgrimage from China to Jerusalem.\n\n[8] Merv: Sassanian rule came to an end when the last Sassanian ruler, Yazdegerd III (632–651) was killed not far from the city and the Sassanian military governor surrendered to the approaching Arab army. Representatives of the caliph Umar occupied the city, which became the capital of the Umayyad province of Khorasan. In 671 Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan sent 50,000 Arab troops to Merv as a colony. This colony retained its native Kufan sympathies and became the nucleus of Khurasan. Using the city as their base, the Arabs, led by Qutayba ibn Muslim from 705 to 715, brought under subjection large parts of Central Asia, including Balkh, Bokhara, and Fergana. Merv, and Khorasan in general, became one of the first parts of the Persian-speaking world to become majority-Muslim. Arab immigration to the area was substantial. A Chinese captured at Talas, Du Huan, was brought to Baghdad and toured the caliphate. He observed that in Merv, Khurasan, Arabs and Persians lived in mixed concentrations.\n\n[9] Merv (East Syriac Ecclesiastical Province): The Christian population of the Merv region seems to have increased during the sixth century, as the bishop of Merv was recognised as a metropolitan at the synod of Joseph in 554 and Herat also became a metropolitan diocese shortly afterwards. The first known metropolitan of Herat was present at the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585. The growing importance of the Merv region for the Church of the East is also attested by the appearance of several more Christian centres during the late fifth and sixth century. By the end of the fifth century the diocese of Abrashahr (Nishapur) also included the city of Tus, whose name featured in 497 in the title of the bishop Yohannis of 'Tus and Abrashahr'. Four more dioceses seem also to have been created in the sixth century. The bishops Yohannan of 'Abiward and Shahr Peroz' and Theodore of Merw-i Rud accepted the acts of the synod of Joseph in 554, the latter by letter, while the bishops Habib of Pusang and Gabriel of 'Badisi and Qadistan' adhered by proxy to the decisions of the synod of Ishoyahb I in 585, sending deacons to represent them. None of these four dioceses is mentioned again, and it is not clear when they lapsed.\n\n[10] Merv: Merv gained renewed importance in February 748 when the Iranian general Abu Muslim (d. 755) declared a new Abbasid dynasty at Merv, expanding and re-founding the city, and, in the name of the Abbasid line, used the city as a base of rebellion against the Umayyad caliphate. After the Abbasids became established in Baghdad, Abu Muslim continued to rule Merv as a semi-independent prince until his eventual assassination. Indeed, Merv operated as the center of Abbasid partisanship for the duration of the Abbasid Revolution of 746-750, and later on became a consistent source of political support for the Abbasid rulers in Baghdad; the governorship of Khurasan at Merv was considered one of the most important political figures of the Caliphate. The influential Barmakid family, based in Merv, played an important part in transferring Greek knowledge (established in Merv since the days of the Seleucids and Greco-Bactrians) into the Arab world.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was the city of Merv established?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.

Depending of the size of its population, each \"comarca\" could have from a single judicial court of generic competence to a complex structure of diverse courts of specific competences (civil, criminal, criminal procedure, labor, family, etc.).\n\n[2] Politics of Portugal: Politics in Portugal takes place in a framework of a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the Prime Minister of Portugal is the head of government. Portugal has a multi-party system. The President of Portugal is the executive head of state and has several significant political powers, which he exercises often. Executive power is exercised by the President and the Council of Ministers. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Assembly of the Republic. The Judiciary of Portugal is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n[3] Judiciary of Portugal: An higher court of appeal exists to appreciate and judge the conflicts of jurisdiction between the Judicial and Administrative orders of courts, this being the Conflicts Court (). The Conflicts Court is headed by the president of the Supreme Administrative Court, including also other three judges of this court and three judges of the Supreme Court of Justice.\n\n[4] Judiciary of Portugal: For the purpose of the Judicial order, until 2014, Portugal was divided in 231 uneven \"comarcas\", constituting the territorial areas of jurisdiction of the courts of first instance. With some adjustments carried away over the years, that division was essentiality the one established in the judiciary reform of 1835. Depending on the size of its population, each \"comarca\" could have from a single court of general jurisdiction with just a single judge to a complex structure of diverse courts of special jurisdiction (civil, criminal, criminal procedure, labour, family, etc.), each of which, by itself, could include several specialized sections and judgeships. The \"comarcas\" were grouped in 57 judicial circles (\"círculos judiciais\") and these in four judicial districts (\"distritos judiciais\").\n\n[5] Provinces of Portugal: Each comarca was headed by an administrative and judicial magistrate, which represented Royal power in each jurisdiction of the country. These magistrates were, initially, called \"tenents\" (), later \"meirinhos-mores\" and finally, \"corregedores\". These six comarcas, with some changes, would be maintained as the principal administrative division of country until the 19th century.\n\n[6] Portugal: The President, who is elected to a five-year term, has an executive role: the current President is Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. The Assembly of the Republic is a single chamber parliament composed of 230 deputies elected for a four-year term. The Government is headed by the Prime Minister (currently António Costa) and includes Ministers and Secretaries of State. The Courts are organized into several levels, among the judicial, administrative and fiscal branches. The Supreme Courts are institutions of last resort/appeal. A thirteen-member Constitutional Court oversees the constitutionality of the laws.\n\n[7] Government of Puerto Rico: The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodríguez. The legal system is a mix of the civil law and the common law systems. Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with advice and consent from the Senate.\n\n[8] Banco Português de Negócios: Portugal's Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told a press conference after a special cabinet meeting that the government was to assure deposits in BPN, and that the management of BPN was to be given to the Caixa Geral de Depósitos (Portugal's public bank) under Bank of Portugal's (Banco de Portugal, the Portuguese Central Bank) supervision from November 3, 2008, to prevent a financial crisis chain reaction in Portugal. Portuguese judicial authorities detained the former president of financially troubled BPN. José Oliveira e Costa, who was the CEO of BPN between 1997 and early 2008, was arrested on charges of suspected tax fraud, money laundering, forgery, abuse of credit and illegal gains.\n\n[9] Judiciary of Portugal: There are two separate bodies of career judges, that are part of the civil service. The first one is the Judicial Magistrates Corps, that is formed by the judges who serve in the Judicial courts. The superior body of this Corps is the Higher Council of Magistracy, presided by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. The other is the body of Judges of the Administrative and Tax Jurisdiction. This is headed by the Higher Council of the Administrative and Tax Courts, presided by the President of the Supreme Administrative Court. Although independent of each other, the two bodies of career judges share many characteristics. Both have the same categories of judges, that are those of \"conselheiro\" (counselor), \"desembargador\" and \"juíz de direito\" (judge of Law), corresponding, respectively to the judges of the supreme, second instance and first instance courts.\n\n[10] Judiciary of Portugal: The Judicial order (\"Ordem Judicial\") is the first category of common courts (excluding the Constitutional Court), forming a proper hierarchical structure that has the Supreme Court of Justice (\"Supremo Tribunal de Justiça\") in Lisbon as its superior body. This order also includes the five intermediate level courts called \"Relação\" (Guimarães, Oporto, Coimbra, Lisbon and Évora) and the judicial courts of first instance. The judicial courts of first instance can be courts of generic competence or courts of specific competence.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWho is head of the judicial system in Portugal?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question \"Who is head of the judicial system in Portugal?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\nI don't know in context [2].\nI don't know in context [3].\nYes, answer is present in context [4].\nI don't know", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nThe black fungus disease is connected to which type of infection?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Banana freckle: Banana Freckle is a disease caused by the fungus \"Guignardia musae\" (telomorph) or \"Phyllosticta musarum\" (anamorph). Generally, the causal agent of disease is referred to as Guignardia-Phyllosticta sp. There are several different strains of the fungus that exist to infect different banana varieties around the globe. Symptoms include yellowing of the tissue and formation of small dark brown spots on the leaves and fruit. Within the spots, conidia or pycnidia can be found. Banana Freckle is easily propagated and spread from plant to plant by rain splash and movement of infected tissue or fruit. Management of the disease consists of cutting out infected leaves, the paper bag method, fungicide application, and proper sanitation techniques. This devastating disease is extremely relevant for the major banana exporting countries of the world. In the absence of chemical control, there is about a 78% yield loss. Banana Freckle disease needs to be carefully monitored in order to prevent further spread of the disease.\n\n[2] Fascioloides magna: According to several American authors, three types of definitive host exist: Pathology of \"F. magna\" infection varies according to host type but some features are shared by all three types. Primary lesions usually occur in the liver and are associated with mechanical damage due to migrating juvenile flukes or fibrous encapsulation of sedentary adult flukes. The most common feature of \"F. magna\" infection is black pigmentation in abdominal or thoracic organs, especially in the liver. The hematin pigment is produced by flukes as a byproduct of feeding on blood. Pigment within tissues is a result of migrating of juvenile flukes and it accumulates within hepatic cells without resorption. \"F. magna\" has also been associated with Red Water disease in bovine. \"F. magna\" causes liver damage, which allows the bacteria \"Clostridium haemolyticum\" to cause secondary infection in hepatic tissue. The infection will decrease the livers function, and the host's urine will become red, hence the name \"Red Water\" disease.\n\n[3] Apple scab: Apple scab is a disease of \"Malus\" trees, such as apple trees, caused by the ascomycete fungus \"Venturia inaequalis\". The disease manifests as dull black or grey-brown lesions on the surface of tree leaves, buds or fruits. Lesions may also appear less frequently on the woody tissues of the tree. Fruits and the undersides of leaves are especially susceptible. The disease rarely kills its host, but can significantly reduce fruit yields and fruit quality. Affected fruits are less marketable due to the presence of the black fungal lesions. The infection cycle begins in the springtime, when suitable temperatures and moisture promote the release of \"V. inaequalis\" ascospores from leaf litter around the base of previously infected trees. These spores rise into the air and land on the surface of a susceptible tree, where they germinate and form a germ tube that can directly penetrate the plant's waxy cuticle. A fungal mycelium forms between the cuticle and underlying epidermal tissue, starting as a yellow spot that grows and ruptures to reveal a black lesion bearing asexually as the conidia are released and germinate on fresh areas of the host tree, which in turn produce another generation of conidial spores. This cycle of secondary infections continues throughout the summer, until the leaves and fruit fall from the tree at the\n\n[4] Ceratocystis fimbriata: Ceratocystis fimbriate is an ascomycete fungal pathogen. The species as a whole can infect a wide variety of hosts, but particular strains are host-specific. One example is the Ipomoea form of the fungus, which is specific to sweet potato (Ipomea batatas) and wild morning glory. Symptoms can be found on the fleshy root or visible in plants(). On sweet potato, Ceratocystis fimbriate causes a disease called 'black rot,' which displays firm and dry circular brown/black rots. Infected plants often show stunted growth, wilting, and yellowing. Wilting occurs because this pathogen can also travel through xylem and infect vascular system (). During disease, white, fuzzy mycelia with long black perithecia grow out from the lesions (). Additionally, research demonstrates that sweet potatoes infected with C. fimbriate demonstrate increased respiration which is partially due to the infection’s influence on protein metabolism (). Higher respiration rates cause dry weight loss in the tubers which poses a problem for marketability.\n\n[5] Cochliobolus sativus: The fungus Cochliobolus sativus is the teleomorph (sexual stage) of Bipolaris sorokiniana (anamorph) which is the causal agent of a wide variety of cereal diseases. The pathogen can infect and cause disease on the root (where it is known as common root rot), leaf and stem, and head tissue. \"C.sativus\" is extremely rare in nature and thus it is the asexual or anamorphic stage which causes infections. The two most common diseases caused by \"B.sorokiniana\" are spot blotch and common root rot, mainly on wheat and barley crops.\n\n[6] Spring black stem: About 72 hours after inoculation, germination and penetration of stems occurs. The fungus infects stem tissues directly through stomata or wounds, or through penetration of the host cell wall by a penetration peg produced by a specialized cell known as an appresorium. Once it causes necrosis of the epidermal cells, the fungus moves toward the chlorenchyma and cortical tissues. Lesions appear deep and dark. They enlarge and merge as the fungus moves along and across stem tissues. Conductive vessels, such as the xylem and phloem are last to be infected. Before invasion, hyphae may cover the root and plant surface and penetrate directly or through wounds. Root injuries caused by both biotic and abiotic factors, enhance the disease severity. In a cool, wet spring, whole shoots can be blackened. Spring Black Stem is likely a polycyclic disease in the field. This is determined as the fungus infects new growth if favorable environmental conditions occur, usually in spring and fall, multiple times during the disease cycle. It is a seed and soil-borne pathogen, although survival is limited to up to two years without a host. Spring black stem mostly occurs during spring season because spring’s cool and moist weather condition is the perfect environment for the infection to spread. Whenever the environment is wet, spores can be splashed onto the leaves, petioles,\n\n[7] Wheat leaf rust: Wheat leaf rust is a fungal disease that affects wheat, barley and rye stems, leaves and grains. In temperate zones it is destructive on winter wheat because the pathogen overwinters. Infections can lead up to 20% yield loss, which is exacerbated by dying leaves, which fertilize the fungus. The pathogen is \"Puccinia\" rust fungus. \"Puccinia triticina\" causes \"black rust\", \"P. recondita\" causes \"brown rust\", and \"P. striiformis\" causes \"yellow rust\". It is the most prevalent of all the wheat rust diseases, occurring in most wheat growing regions. It causes serious epidemics in North America, Mexico and South America and is a devastating seasonal disease in India. All three types of \"Puccinia\" are heteroecious requiring two distinct and distantly related hosts (alternate hosts). Rust and the similar smut are members of the class Pucciniomycetes but rust is not normally a black powdery mass.\n\n[8] Daucus carota: Black root rot of carrot is caused by\" \"a pathogenic fungus \"Chalara elegans (Thielaviopsis basicola)\". The fungus infects several types of crops including carrots. \"C. elegans\" can infect carrots in all stages of growth, thriving in humidity and warm temperatures. When infected, the carrot starts to develop black markings on the root. The fungus can remain in infected soil for years through chlamydospores. \"C. elegans\" thrives in highly acidic, organic soil, especially with large amounts of vitamin C. Damaged carrots in areas of high temperatures are more susceptible to accelerated growth of black root rot.\n\n[9] Black point (disease): Black point (blackpoint, kernel smudge or just smudge) is often considered a fungal disease that affects wheat, barley and rye. It is thought to be caused by various species of Alternaria, Fusarium, and Helminthosporium, and possibly other fungal genera. The fungus forms after the seeds have set but while they are still green and it is by high humidity. Infected areas are brown to black in color, and as the disease spreads the kernels may become shriveled. Occasionally the infected areas have a reddish tinge.\n\n[10] Microsporum gypseum: The species is keratinophilic and is known for causing diseases on human skin. The genus \"Microsporum\" contains a number of pathogens to both humans and animals. The diseases it causes is classified as tinea or ringworm, with an adjective prescribing to the afflicted body part. Infection usually occurs as tinea capitis with suppuration and kerion formation. Pus formation can also occur from palpitated hair follicles. The species is ectothrix in terms of hair infection and can infect more than one part of the scalp at a time. The fungus produces hyphal growth at the scalp, and produces fronds (perforating organs) that invade the hair perpendicularly at the cortex near the edge of the cuticles. This can cause hair to be easily removed and dislodged from the scalp. Additionally, individuals with thick dark hair have a tendency to have a more severe inflammatory response. Tinea corporis, as well; this is characterized as an intense inflammatory response resembling a bacterial infection, thus surgical intervention is not needed because inflammation is due to the fungus alone. Also, tinea pedis, or athletes foot is common, while tinea unguium is rare. Additionally tinea manuum, of the thighs may occur as nodular granulomatous perifolliculitis, has been noted with infection of the thighs.

Arabic speakers make up 85% of the population. Several modern Arabic dialects are used in everyday life, most notably Levantine in the west and Mesopotamian in the northeast. A report published by the UNHCR points out that \"while the majority of Syrians are considered Arabs, this is a term based on spoken language (Arabic), not ethnicity.\"\n\n[2] Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia: The official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic. The three main regional variants spoken by Saudis are Hejazi Arabic, Najdi Arabic, and Gulf Arabic. There are approximately 2 million Gulf Arabic speakers in Saudi Arabia, and the dialect is only spoken in the Eastern Province. The remaining Arabic speakers in the province speak one of the other two dialects, more commonly the Najdi dialect. Saudi Sign Language is the principal language of the deaf community. The large expatriate communities also speak their own languages, the most numerous of which are Indian languages, Filipino/Tagalog, Egyptian Arabic, Indonesian, Rohingya, and Urdu.Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil producing company of Saudi Arabia, is based in Dhahran, which is located in the Eastern Province, and most decisions on oil policy and production that affect the global economy are made there. The kingdom's main oil and gas fields are mostly located in the Eastern Province, onshore and offshore. Notable among these are the Ghawar Field and the largest crude increment in the world. Petroleum from the fields is shipped to dozens of countries from the oil port of Ras Tanura and is also used as feedstock in numerous industrial plants in Jubail.\n\n[3] Arabic: Even during Muhammad's lifetime, there were dialects of spoken Arabic. Muhammad spoke in the dialect of Mecca, in the western Arabian peninsula, and it was in this dialect that the Quran was written down. However, the dialects of the eastern Arabian peninsula were considered the most prestigious at the time, so the language of the Quran was ultimately converted to follow the eastern phonology. It is this phonology that underlies the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic. The phonological differences between these two dialects account for some of the complexities of Arabic writing, most notably the writing of the glottal stop or \"hamzah\" (which was preserved in the eastern dialects but lost in western speech) and the use of ' (representing a sound preserved in the western dialects but merged with ' in eastern speech).\n\n[4] Hejazi Arabic: Also referred to as the sedentary Hejazi dialect, this is the form most commonly associated with the term \"Hejazi Arabic\", and is spoken in the urban centers of the region, such as Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina. With respect to the axis of bedouin versus sedentary dialects of the Arabic language, this dialect group exhibits features of both. Like other sedentary dialects, the urban Hejazi dialect is less conservative than the bedouin varieties in some aspects and has therefore shed some Classical forms and features that are still present in bedouin dialects, these include gender-number disagreement, and the feminine marker \"-n\" (see Varieties of Arabic). But in contrast to bedouin dialects, the constant use of full vowels and the absence of vowel reduction plus the distinction between the emphatic letters and is generally retained.The Arabic of today is derived principally from the old dialects of Central and North Arabia which were divided by the classical Arab grammarians into three groups: Hejaz, Najd, and the language of the tribes in adjoining areas. Though the modern Hejazi dialects has developed markedly since the development of Classical Arabic, and Modern Standard Arabic is quite distinct from the modern dialect of Hejaz. Standard Arabic now differs considerably from modern Hejazi Arabic in terms of its phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon, such diglossia in Arabic began to\n\n[5] Arabic: Most spoken dialects have monophthongized original to in most circumstances, including adjacent to emphatic consonants, while keeping them as the original diphthongs in others e.g. . In most of the Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian (except Sahil and Southeastern) Arabic dialects, they have subsequently merged into original .\n\n[6] Iraqis: Iraq's national languages are Arabic and the Kurdish languages. Arabic is spoken as a first language by around 79 percent of Iraqi people, and Kurdish by around 17 percent. The two main regional dialects of Arabic spoken by the Iraqi people are Mesopotamian Arabic (spoken in the Babylonian alluvial plain and Middle Euphrates valley) and North Mesopotamian Arabic (spoken in the Assyrian highlands). The two main dialects of Kurdish spoken by Kurdish Iraqis are Central Kurdish (spoken in the Erbil and Sulaymaniyah Governorates) and Northern Kurdish (spoken in Dohuk Governorate). In addition to Arabic, most Assyrians and Mandaeans speak Neo-Aramaic languages.\n\n[7] Arabic: The \"colloquial\" spoken dialects of Arabic are learned at home and constitute the native languages of Arabic speakers. \"Formal\" Literary Arabic (usually specifically Modern Standard Arabic) is learned at school; although many speakers have a native-like command of the language, it is technically not the native language of any speakers. Both varieties can be both written and spoken, although the colloquial varieties are rarely written down and the formal variety is spoken mostly in formal circumstances, e.g., in radio and TV broadcasts, formal lectures, parliamentary discussions and to some extent between speakers of different colloquial dialects. Even when the literary language is spoken, however, it is normally only spoken in its pure form when reading a prepared text out loud and communication between speakers of different colloquial dialects. When speaking extemporaneously (i.e. making up the language on the spot, as in a normal discussion among people), speakers tend to deviate somewhat from the strict literary language in the direction of the colloquial varieties. In fact, there is a continuous range of \"in-between\" spoken varieties: from nearly pure Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), to a form that still uses MSA grammar and vocabulary but with significant colloquial influence, to a form of the colloquial language that imports a number of words and grammatical constructions in MSA, to\n\n[8] Middle East: Arabic, with all its dialects, are the most widely spoken languages in the Middle East, with Literary Arabic being official in all North African and in most West Asian countries. Arabic dialects are also spoken in some adjacent areas in neighbouring Middle Eastern non-Arab countries. It is a member of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Several Modern South Arabian languages such as Mehri and Soqotri are also spoken Yemen and Oman. Another Semitic language such as Aramaic and its dialects are spoken mainly by Assyrians and Mandaeans. There is also a Oasis Berber-speaking community in Egypt where the language is also known as Siwa. It is a non-Semitic Afro-Asiatic language.\n\n[9] Arabic: The phoneme is represented by the Arabic letter ' () and has many standard pronunciations. is characteristic of north Algeria, Iraq, also in most of the Arabian peninsula but with an allophonic in some positions; occurs in most of the Levant and most North Africa; and is used in most of Egypt and some regions in Yemen and Oman. Generally this corresponds with the pronunciation in the colloquial dialects. In some regions in Sudan and Yemen, as well as in some Sudanese and Yemeni dialects, it may be either or , representing the original pronunciation of Classical Arabic. Foreign words containing may be transcribed with , , , , , or , mainly depending on the regional spoken variety of Arabic or the commonly diacriticized Arabic letter. Note also that in northern Egypt, where the Arabic letter ' () is normally pronounced , a separate phoneme , which may be transcribed with , occurs in a small number of mostly non-Arabic loanwords, e.g., 'jacket'.\n\n[10] Demographics of Western Sahara: Hassaniya, primarily spoken at home, is dominated by the Moroccan dialect spoken in the streets, workplace, and schools. This is because the great majority of the population consists of Moroccans who settled in Western Sahara. French is also commonly used by the Moroccan administration. In the urban areas Moroccan Arabic is now spoken, as Morocco controls and administers most of the territory of Western Sahara and all of its cities, and considers it an inseparable part of the country. The Moroccan constitution stipulates two official languages for the Kingdom of Morocco, including Western Sahara: Berber (Tamazight) and Arabic.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Their first title, \"Homeworld\", was released on September 28, 1999 to critical acclaim and successful sales. Though they did not immediately continue working on the franchise (Sierra Entertainment, the game's publisher, owned the rights), the game did have a spin-off, \"\", developed by Barking Dog Studios and published by Sierra.\n\n[2] Blackbird Interactive: Blackbird was founded in 2007 by former members of Relic Entertainment and EA Canada. CEO Rob Cunningham and chief creative officer Jon Aaron Kambeitz had also been founding members of Relic, and had been on the development team for the 1999 RTS \"Homeworld\" and its 2003 sequel, \"Homeworld 2\". In 2010, after beginning operations, Blackbird began working on a game they considered a \"spiritual successor\" to \"Homeworld\", entitled \"Hardware: Shipbreakers\". The studio entered into negotiations with THQ, which controlled Relic, for adapting their original game into a \"Homeworld\" game, but were unable to secure access to the intellectual property.\n\n[3] Homeworld: Homeworld is a real-time strategy video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by Sierra Studios on September 28, 1999, for Microsoft Windows. Set in space, the science fiction game follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing mothership to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way. In each of the game's levels, the player gathers resources, builds a fleet, and uses it to destroy enemy ships and accomplish mission objectives. The player's fleet carries over between levels, and can travel in a fully three-dimensional space within each level rather than being limited to a two-dimensional plane.\n\n[4] Relic Entertainment: Relic Entertainment, known as THQ Canada Inc. between 2004 and 2013, is a Canadian video game developer based in Vancouver, founded in 1997. The studio specializes in real-time strategy games and is known for series such as \"Homeworld\", \"\" and \"Company of Heroes\". Acquired by THQ in 2004, the company was sold to Sega on January 22, 2013 as part of THQ's bankruptcy. Relic is now a part of Sega West, which also comprises Creative Assembly, Sports Interactive and Amplitude Studios.\n\n[5] Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment: In 2003, they co-published their first video game, \"\". Electronic Arts was the other publisher of the game. In 2004, Warner Bros. acquired developer Monolith Productions. In 2005, the WB Games label was created. The first game that Monolith developed in conjunction with Warner Bros. Entertainment was \"The Matrix Online\" which SEGA helped co-publish. Warner Bros. also helped distribute both \"Enter the Matrix\" and \"\" for the \"Matrix\" series. In 2006, they bought a 10.3% stake in SCi Entertainment, the owner of Eidos Interactive. That same year, they released their first self-published title (with no co-publishers), \"Justice League Heroes\", which was distributed by Eidos on the Xbox. In 2007, their goal was for a five-year plan to expand in the video game industry, which includes the acquisition of studios for internal development and the creation of a studio (WB Games) in the Seattle area that will run all the games published and developed by the company; starting with the acquisition of TT Games that same year for the amount of .\n\n[6] Steam (software): Steam's development began in 2002, with working games for the platform being \"Grid\" and \"Gazelle\". It was publicly announced at the Game Developers Conference event on March 22, 2002, and released as a beta the same day. To demonstrate the ease of integrating Steam with a game, Relic Entertainment created a special version of \"Impossible Creatures\". Valve partnered with several companies, including AT&T, Acer, and GameSpy. The first mod released on the system was \"Day of Defeat\".\n\n[7] Homeworld: Relic Entertainment was founded in Vancouver, Canada, on June 1, 1997, and began work on \"Homeworld\" as their first title. Relic co-founders Alex Garden and Luke Moloney served as the director and lead programmer for the game, respectively, while Erin Daly was the designer and Aaron Kambeitz the lead artist. Garden was 22 years old when he founded the company. Writer David J. Williams is credited with the original story concept, while the script itself was written by Martin Cirulis and the background lore was written by author Arinn Dembo. Cirulis and Dembo, credited jointly as \"Marcus Skyler\", were selected by the publisher, Sierra Studios, partway through development to expand the story concept of Relic and Williams. Sierra agreed to publish the game early in development based on, according to Garden, \"two whiteboard presentations and no demo\". The development of the game took over two years; the game systems were largely complete by the final eight months, which Relic spent polishing and improving the game, including adding the whole-map Sensors Manager view. The game was initially expected to be released at the end of 1998; Garden stated in a 1999 interview that the team found creating the core game itself much easier than getting it to the quality level they wanted, and that if they had known how difficult it was going to be they may have chosen not to do the project. Several ideas for the game, including ship customization, convoy routes, and different unit types for the Kushan\n\n[8] Alex Garden: Alex Garden is the CEO of Vancouver-based game developer Relic Entertainment, which he co-founded with Luke Moloney in 1997. In February 2005, he founded the company iVALET Systems Inc. to develop an advanced parking system. In July 2005, he co-founded Klei Entertainment, a Vancouver-based video game development studio, with Jamie Cheng. On November 3, 2006, Alex Garden joined Nexon to run Nexon's North American game development studio, Nexon Publishing North America. In October, 2009, Alex Garden joined Microsoft to work in their games division, Microsoft Game Studios. On April 23, 2014, Zynga announced that Alex Garden was hired to become President of Zynga Studios with a start date of May 5, 2014. On 13 April 2016 Alex Garden returned to Relic Entertainment as CEO. In 2016 Garden founded Zume Pizza.\n\n[9] List of Relic Entertainment games: Relic Entertainment is a Canadian video game developer based in Vancouver. The company was founded in June 1997 by Alex Garden and Luke Moloney. After its debut title \"Homeworld\" (1999), the company developed two more games, \"Impossible Creatures\" (2003) and \"Homeworld 2\" (2003), and signed a contract with publisher THQ for an additional two games. Before either game was released, however, Relic was bought by THQ in May 2004 for $10 million in cash; the company was renamed THQ Canada, with \"Relic Entertainment\" used as a marketing brand by the studio. THQ published the next five games by the company. A few months after being purchased, Relic released its first licensed title, \"\" (2004). It released two more original titles in 2006, \"The Outfit\" and \"Company of Heroes\", before transitioning to focus on further titles and expansion packs in the \"Warhammer 40,000\" and \"Company of Heroes\" franchises.\n\n[10] Company of Heroes: Company of Heroes is a 2006 real-time strategy video game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ for the Microsoft Windows and OS X operating systems.

The Unicode for ᄒ is U+314E.\n\n[3] Serfdom in Tibet controversy: Widespread and numerous instances of repression target ordinary citizens, monks, nuns, and even children in an effort to quash alleged \"separatism.\" Seven Tibetan boys in Gansu province were detained for over a month in early September after they allegedly wrote slogans on the walls of a village police station and elsewhere calling for the return of the Dalai Lama and a free Tibet. Ronggyal Adrak was detained and charged under state security offenses by police on August 1 after he called for the Dalai Lama's return at a horse race festival in Sichuan province. He is awaiting trial. The Chinese government has failed to bring to justice those responsible for the shooting death by People's Armed Police officers of a 17-year-old nun, Kelsang Namtso, while trying to cross the border into Nepal on September 30, 2006. It is notable in this Report that most of the examples are not in the Tibet Autonomous Region, but in other provinces of China, such as Gansu Province and Sichuan Province (Tibetan areas in Sichuan are the eastern part of Kham). These areas (i.e. the Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province, Gansu Province, Yunnan Province and Qinghai Province) were not included in political Tibet, so they were not involved in the Serfs' Emancipation, which was in the Tibet Autonomous Region. During the \"reform and opening up\" after 1978, when the central government of the PRC gave numerous support \n\n[4] Tibet Museum (Lhasa): This section features items ranging in age from 50,000 to 3000 years old. Many of the items such as stone tools, pottery, bone objects and metal objects were unearthed at the Karuo and Qugong sites and are representative of the Neolithic culture of the Tibetan Plateau and the origins of the Tibetan people. There is also a room showing the variety of flora found in Tibet as well as several geological samples.\n\n[5] ᅰ: ᅰ is one of the Korean hangul. The Unicode for ᅰ is U+315E.\n\n[6] ᅯ: ᅯ is one of the Korean hangul. The Unicode for ᅯ is U+315D.\n\n[7] History of Tibet (1950–present): The Chinese Communist government led by Mao Zedong, which came to power in October, lost little time in asserting a new PRC presence in Tibet. The PRC has carried out different projects in Tibet but the people of Tibet seem to feel ignored politically and economically in the “Tibet Autonomous Region” and in the Tibetan portions of land in Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan. In June 1950, the UK Government in the House of Commons stated that His Majesty's Government \"have always been prepared to recognize Chinese suzerainty over Tibet, but only on the understanding that Tibet is regarded as autonomous.\" On 7 October 1950, The People's Liberation Army invaded the Tibetan area of Chamdo. The large number of units of the PLA quickly surrounded the outnumbered, largely pacifistic Tibetan forces. By October 19, 1950, 5,000 Tibetan troops had surrendered under PRC Oppression.\n\n[8] Bridge in Tredyffrin Township: The Bridge in Tredyffrin Township was a historic stone arch bridge carrying Gulph Road across Trout Creek in Tredyffrin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, USA. It had one span, a solid, semicircular stone arch long. There were stone wing walls at each end, with roughly squared stone voussoirs forming the arch ring. The vault of the arch had been sealed with gunite when the bridge was surveyed in 1982, and the parapets had also been topped with concrete. The bridge was built at an unknown date in the late 19th or early 20th century, and was a well-preserved, typical example of stone arch bridge construction in that period.\n\n[9] Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film): Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" acclaimed the film in general, stating that \"\"Seven Years in Tibet\" is an ambitious and beautiful movie with much to interest the patient viewer, but it makes the common mistake of many films about travelers and explorers: It is more concerned with their adventures than with what they discover.\" Additionally, Ebert believed the film was told from the perspective of the wrong character and thought the casting of Pitt and Thewlis should have been reversed. Derek Elley of \"Variety\" praised the film's overall production value but thought: \"for a story with all the potential of a sweeping emotional drama set in great locations, too often you just long for the pic to cut loose from the ethnography and correct attitudes and go with the drama in old Hollywood style.\"\n\n[10] Human rights in Tibet: The figure of 1.2 million dead is challenged by Chinese demographer Yan Hao who says that the methodoloy used by the TGIE is defective. “How can they come to these exact death figures by analysing documents,” he questions, “if they have problems in working out an exact figure of Tibet’s total population alive at present?” “How can they break down the figures by regions” “when they have a problem in clearly defining the boundary of the greater Tibet as well as its provinces?” Yan Hao stresses that “knowledge of statistics tells us that random sampling is necessary for acquiring reliable data in any surveys” and “those conducted entirely among political refugees could produce anything but objective and unbiased results.”\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nHow old is Tibet?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question \"How old is Tibet?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.

What is the name of the country?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Vision 2021: Vision 2021 was the political manifesto of the Bangladesh Awami League party before winning the National Elections of 2008. It stands as a political vision of Bangladesh for the year 2021, the golden jubilee of the nation. The policy has been criticized as a policy emblematic of technological optimism in the context of Bangladesh and the state repression of media, low internet penetration, inadequate electricity generation. The Vision 2021 is an articulation of where this nation needs to be in 2021 – the year which marks the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh's independence.\n\n[2] 2021 South Sudanese general election: General elections were scheduled to be held in South Sudan by 9 July 2015, the first since independence. However, in light of an alleged coup d'état attempt and continuing conflict in the country this has been thrown into doubt, especially since no permanent constitution has been formulated. The South Sudan parliament voted in April 2015 to amend the country's transitional 2011 constitution to extend the presidential and parliamentary term until 9 July 2018, with 264 members in favour and a handful opposing it. It was postponed again to 2021 in July 2018.\n\n[3] Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003: The issue was brought to a head in the election of the Secretary-General. The incumbent, New Zealander Don McKinnon, was nominated for another four-year term, and convention stipulates that an incumbent running again is to be unchallenged. However, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa spearheaded a campaign to have Sri Lanka's Lakshman Kadirgamar elected in protest over the handling of the Zimbabwe matter. Nonetheless, African countries were divided, with only five African Heads of Government voting with Mbeki, and the attempt to move the election down the agenda to provide time to develop momentum for the movement was unsuccessful. With Mbeki's tactics failing, and with neither Kadirgamar nor the Prime Minister or President of Sri Lanka in Abuja, the challenge was easily defeated, by forty votes to eleven.\n\n[4] Sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly: An election to choose 18 members of the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term will take place. The outgoing states are: Angola, Ecuador, Guatemala, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Moldova, Qatar, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. Declared losing candidates were South Sudan (89) and Uruguay (93). Others who received votes were: Andorra, Iran, Jordan, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Portugal San Marino, Singapore, Slovakia, Thailand and Tunisia. All received just one vote except Jordan, who got 16 votes, and Tunisia, who got two votes. On 12 November, those elected were Algeria (164), China (176), Cuba (148), France (174), Macedonia (177), Maldives (164), Mexico (135), Morocco (163), Namibia (150), Russia (176), Saudi Arabia (140), the United Kingdom (171)and Vietnam (184), amid controversy. Namibia, Macedonia and Vietnam were elected for the first time. The minimum required votes was 97. In reaction the U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: \"We regret that some countries elected to the Human Rights Council have failed to show their commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. [The council was able to] work together and make progress [when Russia, China and Cuba were members and] that is what we are hopeful of with the council moving forward.\"\n\n[5] Sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly: An election to choose 18 members of the United Nations Human Rights Council for a three-year term took place from 12–18 November. The outgoing members were: Cameroon, Djibouti, Mauritius, Nigeria and Senegal (African group); Bangladesh, China, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan and Saudi Arabia (Asian group); Hungary and Russia (Eastern European group); Cuba, Mexico and Uruguay (Latin American and Caribbean group); and Belgium, Norway and the United States (Western Europe and Others group). Current candidates were: Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Sudan (African group); Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Japan, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates (Asian group); Estonia and Montenegro (Eastern European group); Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela (Latin American and Caribbean group); and Germany, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the United States, though there are only three vacancies (Western Europea and Others group). Those members whose terms expire in June will automatically have their terms extended by six months. Only the Western Europe and Others group was a contested election, with the winners being: Ireland, Germany and the United States. Additionally, other candidates that received votes were: Sudan (4), Bolivia (2), Panama (1) and the Netherlands (1). Côte d'Ivoire, Estonia, Ethiopia, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Montenegro, Sierra Leone, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela won seats to the body for the first time; while the United States was re-elected; and Argentina, Brazil, Gabon, Germany, Japan,\n\n[6] Ndyakira Amooti: He published the children's book \"What a Country Without Animals!\" in 1998, and has also published the books \"What a Country Without Birds\", \"What a Country Without Grasslands\", and \"What a Country Without Wetlands\". The books are about environmental issues, written for children from nine to twelve years old, and the story's principal character is the young man \"Kazoora\".\n\n[7] Next New Zealand general election: The Governor-General must issue writs for an election within seven days of the expiration or dissolution of the current Parliament. Under section 17 of the Constitution Act 1986, Parliament expires three years \"from the day fixed for the return of the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer.\" The writs for the 2017 election were returned on Thursday, 12 October 2017. As a result, the 52nd Parliament must dissolve no later than Monday, 12 October 2020. Consequently, the last day for issuance of writs of election is Monday, 19 October 2020. The writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance (save for any judicial recount or death of a candidate), which will be Monday, 7 December 2020. Because polling day must be on a Saturday, and two weeks is generally required for the counting of special votes, the last possible date for the next general election is Saturday, 21 November 2020.\n\n[8] Instant-runoff voting: IRV was introduced for federal (nationwide) elections in Australia after the Swan by-election in October 1918, in response to the rise of the conservative Country Party, representing small farmers. The Country Party split the non-Labor vote in conservative country areas, allowing Labor candidates to win without a majority of the vote. The conservative government of Billy Hughes introduced IRV (in Australia called \"preferential voting\") as a means of allowing competition between the Coalition parties without putting seats at risk. It was first used at the Corangamite by-election on 14 December 1918, and at a national level at the 1919 election. IRV continued to benefit the Coalition until the 1990 election, when for the first time Labor obtained a net benefit from IRV.\n\n[9] 2019 South African general election: When the National Assembly's term expires (or if it is dissolved), the President must call and set dates for an election, which must be held within 90 days of the date the National Assembly was dissolved or its term expired. Therefore if the National Assembly is not dissolved before 6 May 2019, the election must be held by 4 August 2019. A proclamation calling and setting dates for an election may be issued before or after the expiry of the term of the National Assembly. On the weekends of 10-11 March 2018 and 26-27 January 2019 all voting stations were opened for new voters to register and for those who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. All South African political parties launched voter registration campaigns. Politicians especially urged the youth to register to vote. Following the January 2019 registration, the Commission announced that over 700 000 new voters had registered over the weekend. This brings the combined total of new voters to over 1.1 million, which brings the total number of voters on the voter roll to 26 727 921.\n\n[10] Not Too Young To Run: The Age Reduction Bill popularly known as Not Too Young To Run bill is a constitutional amendment movement led by young Nigerians. The bill was conceived and pushed by several civil society groups including YIAGA Africa, beginning in May 2016. The group is headed by Samson Itodo, a human right activist and good governance campaigner who is the Executive Director of YIAGA Africa. The bill was sponsored in House of Representatives by Tony Nwulu and in the Senate by AbdulAziz Nyako. The bill seeks alteration in sections 65, 106, 131, 177 of the Constitution of Nigeria, which is reduce the age of running for elective positions for House of Assembly and House of Representatives from 30 year old to 25 year old, Senate and Governorship from 35 year old to 30 year old and office of the president from 40 to 30 and independent candidature in Nigeria.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhat is the name of the country that has had an election in 2021 after 14 years without?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Hart attend college?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Alan L. Hart: Hart attended Albany College (now Lewis & Clark College), then transferred with classmate and romantic partner Eva Cushman to Stanford University for the 1911–1912 school year before going back to Albany. Hart graduated from Albany College in 1912, and in 1917 obtained a doctor of medicine degree from the University of Oregon Medical Department in Portland (now Oregon Health & Science University); during this period, Hart also returned to Northern California to attend courses in the summer of 1916 at the Stanford University School of Medicine, then located in San Francisco. Hart was deeply unhappy that the medical degree was issued in his female name, limiting his opportunities to use it in any future life under a male name. College records show that at least one of the senior staff was sympathetic; his graduation records were indexed internally with the suffix \"(aka Robert L.), M.D.\". Nonetheless, Hart knew that if he presented himself as Robert, any prospective employer checking his credentials would discover the female name or find no records for him at all. After graduation he worked for a short while (presenting as a woman) at a Red Cross hospital in Philadelphia.\n\n[2] Alan L. Hart: In 1948, after Hart obtained a master's degree in public health from Yale, the couple moved to Connecticut, where Hart had been appointed Director of Hospitalization and Rehabilitation for the Connecticut State Tuberculosis Commission. The couple lived for the rest of their lives in West Hartford, Connecticut, where Edna became a professor at the University of Hartford. After the Second World War synthetic testosterone became available in the US, and for the first time Hart was able to grow a beard and shave. He also developed a deeper voice, making him more confident and his public appearances easier.\n\n[3] Alan L. Hart: In Oregon, Hart suffered an early blow when a former medical school classmate outed him as transgender, forcing Hart and his wife to move. Hart found the experience traumatic and again consulted Gilbert, who wrote that Hart had suffered from \"the hounding process ... which our modern social organization can carry on to such perfection and refinement.\". Hart set up a new practice in remote Huntley, Montana, writing later that he \"did operations in barns and houses...('til) the crash of the autumn of 1920 wiped out most of the Montana farmers and stockmen, and me along with them\". He then took itinerant work, until in 1921, on a written recommendation from noted doctor Harriet J. Lawrence (decorated by President Wilson for developing a flu vaccine), he secured a post as staff physician at Albuquerque Sanatorium.\n\n[4] William L. Hart: William Lincoln Hart was born February 5, 1867 to Benjamin F. and Ariel S. (Dreghorn) Hart of Salineville or Inverness, Columbiana County, Ohio. He attended the schools of Columbiana County, and began teaching at age 18. He alternated teaching and attending Mount Union College, Alliance, Stark County, Ohio for seven years, and graduated A.B. in 1893. He taught in the schools of his home district, and Madison and Butler Townships, Columbiana County, and Paris Township, Stark County. During 1893 to 1895 he was city editor of the Alliance \"Daily Critic\". In 1895 he entered the University of Michigan Law School, and graduated Bachelor of Laws in 1897. He was president of the senior class and was Alpha Tau Omega.\n\n[5] Alan L. Hart: Alan Lucille Hart was born October 4, 1890, in Halls Summit, Coffey County, Kansas, to Albert L. Hart and Edna Hart (née Bamford). When his father died of typhoid fever in 1892, his mother reverted to her maiden name and moved the family to Linn County, Oregon, where she cared for her own mother during a period of sickness. When Hart was five years old his mother remarried, to Bill Barton, and the family moved to Edna's father's farm. Hart wrote later, in 1911, of his happiness during this time, when he was free to present as male, playing with boys' toys made for him by his grandfather. His parents and grandparents largely accepted and supported his gender expression, though his mother described his \"desire to be a boy\" as \"foolish.\" His grandparents' obituaries, from 1921 and 1924, both list Hart as a grandson. When Hart was 12 the family moved to Albany. There Hart was obliged to present as female to attend school, where he was treated as a girl. He continued to spend the holidays at his grandfather's farm, presenting as male among his male friends, \"teasing the girls and playing boy's games\". According to a reminiscence piece in the Halls Summit News of June 10, 1921, \"Young Hart was different, even then. Boys' clothes just felt natural. [Alan] always regarded [him]self as a boy and begged [his] family to cut [his] hair\n\n[6] Alan L. Hart: Hart's surgery was completed at the University of Oregon Medical School over the 1917–1918 winter vacation. He then legally changed his name.\n\n[7] Alan L. Hart: As a suppressed male during his school years, Hart was allowed to write essays under his chosen name \"Robert Allen Bamford, Jr.\" with little resistance from his classmates or teachers. It was common at the time for writers to use pseudonyms, including to assume names associated with the opposite gender. Hart published work in local newspapers and in school and college publications under this name, or as \"submitted by an anonymous boy\", or using the neutral \"A.L.H.\" or \"A. Hart\". He used his legal name only under pressure from peers or seniors. His early work dealt with masculine subjects, even when he was asked to write on topics about life as a woman. When asked to write about female classmates or friends he portrayed them as prize fighters or boyish basketball players.\n\n[8] Nathaniel G. S. Hart: Hart attended Princeton College, where his classmates included William Elliott from western Ontario. Elliott's father was a Loyalist who had resettled in Canada after the Revolutionary War. The two young men were close enough that Elliot stayed with Hart's parents for a time to recover from a serious illness.\n\n[9] Sylvan Ambrose Hart: Hart attended McPherson College in McPherson, Kansas, in 1926, then studied petroleum engineering at the University of Oklahoma in 1927–28, but did not graduate. He purchased of land at Five Mile Bar for one dollar, where he built a compound that included a two-story house, blacksmith shop, a stone turret, and a bomb shelter. The defensive structures reflected his sense of continual threat from the federal government, which peaked in 1956 when Howard Zahniser's Wilderness Act threatened to designate the Five Mile section of the Salmon River as a non-habitable Primitive Area, and he was in danger of being evicted.\n\n[10] Alan L. Hart: The relocations, financial insecurity, and secrecy placed strain on Hart's marriage, and Inez left him in September 1923. She ordered him to have no further contact with her, and divorced him in 1925. The same year Hart married his second wife, Edna Ruddick; the union lasted until the end of Hart's life. In 1925 Hart moved to the Trudeau School of Tuberculosis in New York, where he also carried out postgraduate work; he spent 1926–1928 as a clinician at the Rockford TB sanatorium in Illinois. In 1928 Hart obtained a master's degree in Radiology from the University of Pennsylvania; he was in 1929 appointed Director of Radiology at Tacoma General Hospital. During the 1930s the couple moved to Idaho, where Hart worked during the 1930s and early 1940s; his work also took him to Washington, where he held a research fellowship as a roentgenologist in Spokane. During the war Hart was also a medical adviser at the Army Recruiting and Induction headquarters in Seattle, while Edna worked for the King County Welfare Department in the same city.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It was founded in 1873 with W. W. Skeat as its secretary. The society's publications were divied into four series: bibliographies, reprinted glossaries, original glossaries and miscellanies. One unsatisfactory feature of the publications is that they are often arranged by counties whereas dialect boundaries rarely coincide with county boundaries. Some of the material published by the society was included in Joseph Wright's \"English Dialect Dictionary\". Collectors of dialect words were discouraged from proposing etymologies on the ground that in so doing they might distort the meaning of the words they were collecting. In 1876 the society's headquarters was transferred from Cambridge to Manchester where it remained until a further transfer to Oxford in 1893. The society's library remained at Manchester and was presented to the Manchester Free Library. It consisted of some 800 books and pamphlets. John Howard Nodal became honorary secretary and director of the society in 1874. He continued in office to the dissolution of the society in 1896. The following year the first of the regional dialect societies in England was founded in Yorkshire.\n\n[2] Perceptual dialectology: A pioneering study in traditional perceptual dialectology took place in the Netherlands in 1939 and was conducted by W.G. Rensink. The study sought to investigate perceptual dialect boundaries through a Dutch dialect survey in which subjects were asked to state whether they thought other people spoke the same or different dialect as them, and what the dialect difference was if there was deemed to be any. Weijnen analyzed this data through the little-arrow method that she devised. Many studies proceeded from this, and perceptual dialectology surveys took place in various countries.\n\n[3] Glasgow University Union: The Club Leaders for 2018-19 are:The Glasgow University Dialectic Society was the original debating society for students at the University, thought to have originated from some time around the University's foundation in 1451 but re-instituted in 1861. The Dialectic Society was one of the organisations which contributed to the establishment of the union in 1885 and continues to be involved in the debating activities of the union, whilst retaining an independent status. The GUU Convenor of Debates is an \"ex officio\" member of the Board of the Dialectic Society, and the third Parliamentary of the year is dedicated the \"Dialectic Parliamentary\".\n\n[4] Rodolphus Agricola: It was a critical, and systematic treatment of ideas and concepts related to dialectics. \"The significance of \"De inventione dialectica\" for the history of argumentation is that it assimilated the art of dialectic to that of rhetoric. Argumentation focused not on truth but on what might be said with reason. Accordingly, Agricola focused on the \"Topics\" rather than the \"Analytics\" of Aristotle and on Cicero, but also on the writings of historians, poets, and orators. Thus, for Agricola, dialectic was an open field; the art of finding 'whatever can be said with any degree of probability on any subject'(Hamilton, David. \"From Dialectic to Didactic\").\n\n[5] Plato: The role of dialectic in Plato's thought is contested but there are two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition. Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is \"the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position.\" A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are borrowed from Hegel. According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a teleological interpretation at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach \"the end of history.\" Karl Popper, on the other hand, claims that dialectic is the art of intuition for \"visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\"\n\n[6] Bogra District: The mother tongue of this district is Bengali. In this district of Bogra \"the dialect spoken is what is known as Northern dialect of Bengali of the Eastern Branch,\" says Dr. Grierson, \"may be taken to be the form of the language, which is spoken in the Dinajpur District, but the form of the dialect spoke in Bogra differs very little from that of Dinajpur\". The northern dialect is spoken in the district of Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra and Pabna. The whole of the tract has within historic times been subject to Koch tribes and members of this tribe still exist in each district. They were originally reported as speaking their original Koch language, but on an examination of the specimens of the language, Dr. Grierson found that they have given up their original speech, and now only speak more or less corrupt variety of Northern Bengali. Some peculiarities (examples) are given below (\"Bengali>Dialect, English\").\n\n[7] Dialectic: Dialectics has become central to continental philosophy, but it plays no part in Anglo-American philosophy. In other words, on the continent of Europe, dialectics has entered intellectual culture as what might be called a legitimate part of thought and philosophy, whereas in America and Britain, the dialectic plays no discernible part in the intellectual culture, which instead tends toward positivism. A prime example of the European tradition is Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Critique of Dialectical Reason\", which is very different from the works of Popper, whose philosophy was for a time highly influential in the UK where he resided (see below). Sartre states:\n\n[8] Dialectic: Another important principle for Hegel is the negation of the negation, which he also terms \"Aufhebung\" (sublation): Something is only what it is in its relation to another, but by the negation of the negation this something incorporates the other into itself. The dialectical movement involves two moments that negate each other, something and its other. As a result of the negation of the negation, \"something becomes its other; this other is itself something; therefore it likewise becomes an other, and so on ad infinitum\". Something in its passage into other only joins with itself, it is self-related. In becoming there are two moments: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be: by sublation, i.e., negation of the negation, being passes over into nothing, it ceases to be, but something new shows up, is coming to be. What is sublated (\"aufgehoben\") on the one hand ceases to be and is put to an end, but on the other hand it is preserved and maintained. In dialectics, a totality transforms itself; it is self-related, then self-forgetful, relieving the original tension.\n\n[9] Dialectic: Karl Popper has attacked the dialectic repeatedly. In 1937, he wrote and delivered a paper entitled \"What Is Dialectic?\" in which he attacked the dialectical method for its willingness \"to put up with contradictions\". Popper concluded the essay with these words: \"The whole development of dialectic should be a warning against the dangers inherent in philosophical system-building. It should remind us that philosophy should not be made a basis for any sort of scientific system and that philosophers should be much more modest in their claims. One task which they can fulfill quite usefully is the study of the critical methods of science\" (Ibid., p. 335).\n\n[10] Dialect comedy: The term \"Dialect comedy\" was coined by David Marc in his essay, \"Origins of the genre\". Dialect comedies are a genre of radio (and later television) sitcoms that were popular between the 1920s and the 1950s. They relied on the exaggerated and highly stylized portrayal of stereotypes, usually based on ethnic humor. The genre has its roots on the vaudeville stage and in the minstrel shows that became popular in the 19th century. The ethnicities of the actual actors portraying the dialects did not have to match the characters; while much Jewish dialect comedy was created and portrayed by actual Jews, other dialect comedies, such as those involving blackface, were often not. Probably the most enduring program in this genre, Amos N Andy had two feet planted firmly in the minstrel tradition. In 1928, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, two white performers took their blackface act, Sam N Henry, which they did not have the rights to and changed it to Amos N Andy, which became one of the most popular shows of the time. In 1948 Variety proclaimed the show “a national habit, almost as familiar as radio itself.” By the time of its final broadcast in 1960, the show had been renamed Amos N Andy Music Hall.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [7], [8], and [10].\nNo answer is present in [2], [4], [6], and [9].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The office of Prime Minister (\"Peaminister\") first came into use soon after Estonia gained its independence in 1918. From 1918 to 1934, Estonia used a parliamentary political system, where the presidency and ministry were subject to parliamentary confidence, but instead of a presidential office, the government was headed by a Prime Minister and from 1920 to 1934, a similar office called State Elder (\"Riigivanem\").\n\n[2] Eugenia Charles: Dame Mary Eugenia Charles, (15 May 1919 – 6 September 2005) was a Dominican politician who was Prime Minister of Dominica from 21 July 1980 until 14 June 1995. The first woman lawyer in Dominica, she was Dominica's first, and to date only, female prime minister. She was the second female prime minister in the Caribbean after Lucina da Costa of the Netherlands Antilles. She was the first woman in the Americas to be elected in her own right as head of government. She served for the longest period of any Dominican prime minister, and was the world's third longest-serving female Prime Minister, behind Indira Gandhi of India and Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka. She established a record for the longest continuous service of any woman Prime Minister.\n\n[3] Indrek Toome: From 16 November 1988 until 1990, Toome was chairman of the Ministers of the Estonian SSR and therefore communist prime minister of Estonia. It was under his leadership that the government succumb to pressure from the Singing Revolution, the peaceful liberation of Estonia from the domination of the Soviet Communist Party. With the collapse of Soviet rule in Estonia, on 3 April 1990, he handed over his office to the first freely elected prime minister of Estonia after the Second World War, Edgar Savisaar. On 20 January 1991, Estonia was once again an independent state.\n\n[4] Estonia: The Government of Estonia () or the executive branch is formed by the Prime Minister of Estonia, nominated by the president and approved by the parliament. The government exercises executive power pursuant to the Constitution of Estonia and the laws of the Republic of Estonia and consists of twelve ministers, including the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister also has the right to appoint other ministers and assign them a subject to deal with. These are \"ministers without portfolio\" – they don't have a ministry to control. The Prime Minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen. It is also known as the cabinet. The cabinet carries out the country's domestic and foreign policy, shaped by parliament; it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power. The government, headed by the Prime Minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power.\n\n[5] Estonia: Estonia is a parliamentary representative democratic republic in which the Prime Minister of Estonia is the head of government and which includes a multi-party system. The political culture is stable in Estonia, where power is held between two and three parties that have been in politics for a long time. This situation is similar to other countries in Northern Europe. The former Prime Minister of Estonia, Andrus Ansip, is also the European Union's longest-serving Prime Minister (from 2005 until 2014). The current Estonian Prime Minister is Jüri Ratas, who is the former Second Vice-President of the Parliament and the head of the Estonian Centre Party.\n\n[6] Women in the Faroe Islands: Malla Samuelsen was the first Faroese woman to take seat in the parliament, but only for a short period in 1964. In 1978 two women were elected for a whole period: Karin Kjølbro was elected for the Republican Party (Tjóðveldisflokkurin) and Jona Henriksen was elected for the Social Democratic Party (Javnaðarflokkurin) from 1975-78. The first female minister was Jóngerð Purkhús, who became Minister of finance and environment in 1985. Marita Petersen was the first woman who became Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands, she was Prime Minister from January 1993 until September 1994. After the election of 1994 she also became the first Faroese woman to become Speaker of the Løgting. She was a member of the Social Democratic Party (Javnaðarflokkurin). Lisbeth L. Petersen was the first Faroese woman who was elected for the Danish Folketing as one of two Faroese members. Annika Olsen became the first female Deputy Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands on 14 November 2011 and the first female Minister of Internal Affairs of the Faroe Islands on 26 September 2008.\n\n[7] List of heads of government of Estonia: The Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940 made Johannes Vares the new Prime Minister of Estonia, but his rule was later declared to have been illegal. According to the 1938 constitution, Prime Minister was to lead the presidency in case the President couldn't be elected, a move that was implemented for the Estonian Government in Exile. The interim government restored the office of Prime Minister in 1990.\n\n[8] Prime Minister of Estonia: The Prime Minister of Estonia (\"Estonian: peaminister\", literally Main Minister or Head Minister) is the head of government of the Republic of Estonia. The prime minister is nominated by the President after appropriate consultations with the parliamentary factions and confirmed by the Parliament. In case of disagreement, the Parliament can reject the President's nomination and choose their own candidate. In practice, since the Prime Minister must maintain the confidence of Parliament in order to remain in office, he is usually the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. The current Prime Minister is Jüri Ratas of the Centre Party.\n\n[9] Prime Minister of Estonia: Under Estonia's 1920 constitution, the head of government was called the State Elder (\"riigivanem\"), who was also head of state. This system was a radically parliamentary system because the State Elder could be dismissed by the Parliament with a simple majority. Moreover, the State Elder was not the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, nor could he ratify laws or dissolve Parliament. The dissolution of Parliament was only possible through a referendum (see, for example, Seppo Zetterberg, \"A History of Estonia\" / Viron historia. 3rd edition. Helsinki: The Finnish Literary Society / Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2007, pages 524–525). Under a new constitution passed by plebiscite in 1933, the position of Prime Minister was recreated as head of government in 1934 in a more presidential system. Under this constitution, the President could appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister and Cabinet, veto laws, give decrees (statutes) and dissolve Parliament (see Zetterberg 2007, pages 558–559). The sitting State Elder, Konstantin Päts, appointed himself to the position of Prime Minister and in this position was then able to suspend elections for Elder of State and for the Estonian Parliament. He remained Prime Minister, declaring himself \"President-Regent\", until 1938, when elections were held under a new constitution and he was elected President.\n\n[10] List of rulers of Estonia: On 10 September 1721, Sweden ceded Estonia to the Tsardom of Russia, in the Treaty of Nystad.

Aṅgulimāla is born Ahiṃsaka. He grows up as an intelligent young man in Sāvatthī, and during his studies becomes the favorite student of his teacher. However, out of jealousy, fellow students set him up against his teacher. In an attempt to get rid of Aṅgūlimāla, the teacher sends him on a deadly mission to find a thousand human fingers to complete his studies. Trying to accomplish this mission, Aṅgulimāla becomes a cruel brigand, killing many and causing entire villages to emigrate. Eventually, this causes the king to send an army to catch the killer. Meanwhile, Aṅgulimāla's mother attempts to interfere, almost causing her to be killed by her son as well. The Buddha manages to prevent this, however, and uses his power and teachings to bring Aṅgulimāla to the right path. Aṅgulimāla becomes a follower of the Buddha, and to the surprise of the king and others, becomes a monk under his guidance. Villagers are still angry with Aṅgulimāla, but this is improved somewhat when Aṅgulimāla helps a mother with childbirth through an act of truth.\n\n[3] Judo: A judo teacher is called . The word \"sensei\" comes from \"sen\" or \"saki\" (before) and \"sei\" (life) – i.e. one who has preceded you. In Western dojo, it is common to call an instructor of any \"dan\" grade \"sensei\". Traditionally, that title was reserved for instructors of 4th \"dan\" and above.\n\n[4] O͘: O͘ is one of the six Taiwanese Hokkien vowels as written in the Peh-oe-ji (POJ) orthography. It is a normal o followed by Unicode , and is not to be confused with the Vietnamese Ơ. It is pronounced .\n\n[5] Ɯ: Ɯ was used in the Zhuang alphabet from 1957 to 1986 to represent the same vowel as in IPA; sometime before or in 1986, it was replaced with W.\n\n[6] Coulsdon: Martial arts. The Coulsdon Martial Arts Club (also known as Yoshin Ryu) is long established and very popular with children and adults. Yoshin Ryu was originally started in the late seventies as a collection of clubs based in youth centres and sports halls around the Croydon area run by founder and senior coach Errol Field, 7th dan Judo, 5th dan Karate (Shotokan), 6th dan jujitsu. Coulsdon Martial Arts is on the site of what was originally a ‘tin’ church built by the Roman Catholic Church in 1916.. The church building located on this site was purchased in the mid-nineties and converted into a full-time dojo and club HQ. The club president is Mr Brian Jacks – 10th Dan Judo, Olympic Judo medallist, holder of several European and World Judo titles and probably best known for his dominance of the BBC Superstars programs. His bronze medal from the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich was donated to the club and can be seen on display in the foyer.\n\n[7] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[8] Dǒng: Dǒng origins from:People with the name Dong (董) include:\n\n[9] Salwāǧa: Salwāǧa corresponds with the tropical Zodiac sign Aquarius. \"Salwāǧa\" literally means \"pail of water\" in Pashto.\n\n[10] Ƨ: Ƨ was used in the Zhuang alphabet from 1957 to 1986 to indicate the second, or falling, tone (), due to its resemblance to the numeral 2, along with four other letters resembling numbers.

The book by Pausch and Zaslow, translated into 48 languages, was a #1 \"New York Times\" best-seller, spending more than 110 weeks on the list. Media coverage included \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" and an ABC special hosted by Diane Sawyer. More than five million copies of the book are in print in the U.S.\n\n[2] Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams: \"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\" was delivered on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, and friends of Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as this was more than the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying \"A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding – hopefully at the appropriate times – that gives a lot of validation to my kids that a lot of people believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that I did my best to try to live this way.\" The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called \"Journeys\", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.\n\n[3] Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science: Additionally, the Gates Center connects to the Purnell Center, which houses the School of Drama, via the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge. The bridge represents Professor Pausch's own devotion to linking computer science and entertainment, as he was a co-founder of Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center.\n\n[4] Randy Pausch: Randolph Frederick Pausch (October 23, 1960 – July 25, 2008) was an American professor of computer science, human–computer interaction, and design at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n[5] The Last Lecture: The Last Lecture is a \"New York Times\" best-selling book co-authored by Randy Pausch—a professor of computer science, human-computer interaction, and design at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania—and Jeffrey Zaslow of the \"Wall Street Journal\". The book speaks on a lecture Pausch gave in September 2007 entitled \"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\".\n\n[6] Randy Pausch: Pausch gave a lecture about time management on November 27, 2007 at the University of Virginia, to an audience of over 850 people. In March 2008, Pausch appeared in a public service announcement video and testified before Congress in support of cancer research. On May 18, 2008, Pausch made a surprise return appearance at Carnegie Mellon, giving a speech at the commencement ceremony, as well as attending the School of Computer Science's diploma ceremony, and on May 19 Pausch appeared on the show \"Good Morning America\". His lecture, \"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams\", was nominated at the 2007 YouTube Video Awards.\n\n[7] Randy Pausch: Pausch was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and grew up in Columbia, Maryland. After graduating from Oakland Mills High School in Columbia, Pausch received his bachelor's degree in computer science from Brown University in May 1982 and his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in August 1988. While completing his doctoral studies, Pausch was briefly employed at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center and Adobe Systems.\n\n[8] Carnegie Mellon University: In 2008, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch's \"Last Lecture\" became a pop culture phenomenon. Based on a lecture he gave in September 2007 – shortly after he learned his cancer had metastasized – his book quickly rose to the top of bestseller lists around the country. Named in \"Time Magazine\"s \"Time 100\" list of influential people, he died in July 2008 from pancreatic cancer.\n\n[9] Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley: In August 2008, the graduating class of 2008 presented a gift to the university by installing their own Carnegie Mellon University fence on the Silicon Valley campus. The fence is a Carnegie Mellon tradition on the main campus where different student organizations repaint a long fence in the middle of the campus to promote a cause or spread a certain message. Members of the class of 2008 collected money to hire a contractor to build and install a 10-foot fence, that was then subsequently painted with images symbolizing the west coast (like the Golden Gate Bridge, or NASA's Hangar One). The fence was dedicated to Randy Pausch who died in 2008 (the top of the fence reads \"Dedicated to Randy Pausch\"). The remaining money was also donated and gift-matched to a total of $1000 to the Randy Pausch Memorial Fund.\n\n[10] Carnegie Mellon University traditions: In August 2008, the graduating class of 2008 at the Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley Campus brought the tradition to California by installing their own version of the fence, and dedicating it to Randy Pausch, who died in that year.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen did Randy Pausch join the faculty of Carnegie Mellon?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The briefcase holds a symbolic contract which the holder would be able to exchange for a WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship match at any time or location of his choosing up until one year. To participate in the match, a wrestler had to first qualify for it by winning a match; this process began on the February 23 episode of \"Raw\", in which CM Punk qualified by defeating The Miz and John Morrison in a Triple Threat match. The next week of \"Raw\", Kane defeated Rey Mysterio and Mike Knox in another Triple Threat match. The next night on \"ECW\", Mark Henry qualified for the match by defeating Santino Marella. Both Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Shelton Benjamin qualified for the match on the March 6 episode of \"SmackDown\" by defeating Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy in respective singles matches. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", Kofi Kingston qualified by defeating Chris Jericho. Christian qualified the next night on \"ECW\" by winning a battle royal when he last eliminated Chavo Guerrero. Finlay was the final wrestler to qualify for the match when he defeated The Brian Kendrick on the March 13 episode of \"SmackDown\". Over the following weeks, the participants competed in eight-man tag team matches and an eight\n\n[2] WrestleMania X8: WrestleMania X8 was the eighteenth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on March 17, 2002, at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the second WrestleMania at that venue (following WrestleMania VI in 1990). The event marked the final WrestleMania event under the WWF name, as they re-branded to WWE later that year. The record-breaking attendance for the SkyDome of 68,237 grossed approximately $6.1 million CAD ($3.9 million USD). WrestleMania weekend also included WWF Fan Axxess at the Canadian National Exhibition's Automotive Building.\n\n[3] WrestleMania XXX: On February 18, 2013, WWE announced that WrestleMania XXX would be held at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in the city of New Orleans on April 6, 2014. The event is alternatively known as WrestleMania 30. On August 12, travel packages for WrestleMania XXX went on sale, which included tickets to WrestleMania, hotel room accommodation, and other activities including WrestleMania Axxess, the 2014 WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, and the next \"Raw\"; the cheapest package cost $795 per person. On November 16, individual tickets went on sale through Ticketmaster, with prices ranging from $25 to $850. While ordering WrestleMania through pay-per-view television costs between $55 – $70, WWE has also made WrestleMania XXX available live through its new WWE Network online streaming service, which costs $9.99 per month with a six-month contract; WrestleMania was the first event available simultaneously on pay-per-view and on the WWE Network. The event was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana. There are three official theme songs for the event, \"Celebrate\" by Kid Rock, \"Legacy\" by Eminem, and \"\" by Mark Collie. A promotional poster for the event was released through pay-per-view providers such as In Demand, with the tagline \"laissez les bons temps rouler\". The WrestleMania set was built by a crew of roughly 400 workers over two weeks, assembling equipment carried by 85 semi-trailer trucks.\n\n[4] WrestleMania XXVI: Global Spectrum, the University of Phoenix Stadium's operator, had worked in previous years with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to recruit the event to its venue. On January 18, 2008, Global Spectrum publicly announced its intention to host WrestleMania in 2010. The event gained media attention in the weeks prior when a photo of Wayne Gretzky, then head coach of the Phoenix Coyotes, wearing a shirt promoting the event surfaced in the Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\". A press conference, held on February 24, 2009 at the University of Phoenix Stadium, formally announced the event for Glendale, Arizona at the University of Phoenix Stadium; this event marked the first time a WrestleMania had taken place in the state of Arizona. Tickets for the event went on sale November 7, 2009 at 10:00am MST.\n\n[5] WrestleMania XXX: At WrestleMania 31 on March 29, 2015, the main event began as a singles match for champion Brock Lesnar against challenger Roman Reigns. More than ten minutes into the match, Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to make it a triple threat match; Rollins pinned Reigns shortly after to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In other matches, Daniel Bryan wrestled in the pay-per-view opener, a seven-man ladder match, and won the Intercontinental Championship from Bad News Barrett. Next, Rollins lost a singles match to Randy Orton. Then, Triple H defeated Sting in another singles match. A tag match followed where AJ Lee teamed with Paige to defeat Nikki Bella and Brie Bella. Next, Cena scored another WrestleMania victory, this time at the expense of Rusev, while Cena captured the United States Championship. In the penultimate match, the Undertaker (in his return to TV) defeated Bray Wyatt. On the pre-show, Cesaro and Tyson Kidd successfully defended the tag titles, while Big Show won the second Andre the Giant memorial battle royal.\n\n[6] WrestleMania: WrestleMania 34 was held on April 8, 2018, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. In the main event, Brock Lesnar retained the Universal Championship against Roman Reigns. In another main event promoted match, AJ Styles retained the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. Other marquee matches saw Kurt Angle and Ronda Rousey defeat Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in a mixed tag team match, which was Rousey's WWE debut match, and Daniel Bryan had his in-ring return after three years, teaming with Shane McMahon to defeat Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn. Also, The Undertaker defeated John Cena in an impromptu match. In another prominent match, Charlotte Flair retained the SmackDown Women's Championship against Asuka, ending Asuka's two-year undefeated streak, and a 10-year old fan became the youngest WWE champion when he teamed with Braun Strowman to defeat Cesaro and Sheamus for the Raw Tag Team Championship, The SmackDown Tag Team Championship was also defended for the first time at WrestleMania, where The Bludgeon Brothers defeated The Usos and The New Day to win the titles, Matt Hardy last eliminated Baron Corbin to win fifth Andre the Giant memorial battle royal as well as first ever WrestleMania Women's Battle Royal contested where Naomi won by last eliminating Bayley.\n\n[7] WrestleMania: WrestleMania is a professional wrestling event produced annually between mid-March to early April by WWE, an American professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut. WWE first produced the event in 1985 and has since produced 34 editions, with the most recent having been held in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 8, 2018. WrestleMania, WWE's flagship event, airs on pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network and is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. It contributes to the worldwide commercial success of WWE through media, merchandise, and shows. WrestleMania was conceptualized by WWE owner Vince McMahon and long time WWE ring announcer and Hall of Famer Howard Finkel is credited with devising the name \"WrestleMania\" in 1984.\n\n[8] WrestleMania: WrestleMania 33 took place on April 2, 2017 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida. It was the first WrestleMania since WrestleMania 29 in 2013 to feature two world championships on the line: Raw's Universal Championship, defended for the first time at WrestleMania, and SmackDown's WWE Championship. The main event saw Roman Reigns defeat The Undertaker in a No Holds Barred match, giving Undertaker his second loss at WrestleMania. Elsewhere on the event's card, Brock Lesnar defeated Goldberg to become the new Universal Champion, Randy Orton defeated Bray Wyatt to win his ninth WWE Championship, and Mojo Rawley won the fourth annual Andre the Giant memorial battle royal, by last eliminating Jinder Mahal. The event also marked the unannounced return of The Hardy Boyz, who won the Raw Tag Team Championship.\n\n[9] WrestleMania XIX: WrestleMania XIX was the nineteenth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on March 30, 2003, at Safeco Field in Seattle, Washington. The event was the first WrestleMania held in the state of Washington. A record-breaking 54,097 fans from all fifty states and numerous countries from around the world at Safeco Field resulted in a gate attendance grossing $2.76 million.\n\n[10] WrestleMania: WrestleMania XXX was the 30th annual WrestleMania event produced by WWE on April 6, 2014 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. The event was the first WrestleMania to be held in the state of Louisiana. It saw Daniel Bryan defeat Triple H in the opening match. Per the stipulation, this gave Bryan a spot in the main event, where he won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship by making Batista submit in a Triple Threat match which also included Randy Orton. It was the first WrestleMania where the WWE Divas Championship was defended, with AJ Lee retaining the title in the \"Vickie Guerrero Divas Championship Invitational\". WrestleMania XXX also saw the end of The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania as he was defeated by Brock Lesnar in what was described as 'the most shocking result in sports-entertainment history'. At Wrestlemania XXX, Bray Wyatt's undefeated streak since his debut came to an end at the hands of John Cena. Also, at WrestleMania XXX, The Shield defeated Kane and The New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) in a six-man tag team match, and Cesaro won the first ever Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal by body slamming Big Show outside of the ring, in similar fashion to Hulk Hogan body slamming Andre the Giant, at WrestleMania III.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nWhen is the next WrestleMania?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Robeson: The \"Polaris\" expedition, commissioned by Secretary of Navy Robeson, was the United States' first serious attempt at arctic exploration to be the first nation to reach the North Pole. On June 29, 1871, at 7 pm, USS \"Polaris\", sailed from the New York Naval Yard, under the authority of Captain Charles Francis Hall. Sec. of Navy Robeson and Hall, who was on his third arctic expedition, had lobbied Congress successfully to fund the Polaris expedition. Robeson had written specific instructions on the goals of the mission and implemented a hierarchy of command for when Capt. Hall was injured or killed. Robeson directed the course of the expedition, outfitted for two and one half years, giving extensive written instructions. According to Robeson, anything that was found on the expedition would be property of the U.S. Government. He ordered that monuments would be erected on the journey, records and general conditions of the expedition would be kept, and food caches would be established. USS \"Polaris\" was supplied with every scientific instrument needed for such a dangerous and ambitious expedition.\n\n[2] Gustavus Cheyney Doane: In May 1880 Captain Henry W. Howgate of the U.S. Army Signal Corps was mounting an Army sponsored expedition to explore the North Pole. When Doane learned of this he applied for an assignment with the Howgate expedition which the Army granted. The 1880 Howgate Arctic Expedition was tasked with scientific and geographical exploration of Greenland in preparation for an 1881 International Polar Year expeditionary force and Arctic colonization. However, the Army and Navy decided, in June 1880, to withdraw support of the Howgate Arctic Expedition as the expeditionary vessel, the steamship \"Gulnare\", was unseaworthy. Howgate, not to be deterred, found private funding. The expedition was to be based at Ellesmere Island off the coast of Greenland in preparation for further explorations of the polar regions.\n\n[3] David Haig-Thomas: In 1936, Haig-Thomas led an ornithological expedition to Iceland. From 1937 to 1938, he led a British Arctic Expedition in northwest Greenland and Ellesmere Island, accompanied by John Wright and Richard Hamilton. The expedition arrived at Qaanaaq in northwest Greenland in August 1937. They left Etah in March 1938, and crossed Ellesmere Island where they met up with the MacGregor Arctic Expedition. They then sledged to Amund Ringnes Island, Axel Heiberg Island and Haig-Thomas Island in the Canadian Arctic. They returned to Greenland and spent the summer of 1938 in Qaanaaq. Haig-Thomas's collection of Arctic objects from Greenland and northern Canada was donated in two instalments to the British Museum.\n\n[4] Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition: Andrée's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897 was an effort to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished. S. A. Andrée, the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to pass, with luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind in the race for the North Pole.\n\n[5] Matthew Henson: Their first Arctic expedition together was in 1891–92. Henson served as a navigator and craftsman, and was known as Peary's \"first man\". Like Peary, he studied Inuit survival techniques. Also like the expedition leader, he had a relationship with an Inuit woman, fathering a child with her.\n\n[6] North Pole: On 6 April 1969 Wally Herbert and companions Allan Gill, Roy Koerner and Kenneth Hedges of the British Trans-Arctic Expedition became the first men to reach the North Pole on foot (albeit with the aid of dog teams and airdrops). They continued on to complete the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean – and by its longest axis, Barrow, Alaska to Svalbard – a feat that has never been repeated. Because of suggestions (later proven false) of Plaisted's use of air transport, some sources classify Herbert's expedition as the first confirmed to reach the North Pole over the ice surface by any means. In the 1980s Plaisted's pilots Weldy Phipps and Ken Lee signed affidavits asserting that no such airlift was provided. It is also said that Herbert was the first person to reach the pole of inaccessibility. On 17 August 1977 the Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker \"Arktika\" completed the first surface vessel journey to the North Pole.\n\n[7] Fram: In 1898, Otto Sverdrup, who had brought \"Fram\" back on the first Arctic voyage, led a scientific expedition to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. \"Fram\" was slightly modified for this journey, its freeboard being increased. \"Fram\" left harbour on 24 June 1898, with 17 men on board. Their aim was to chart the lands of the Arctic Islands, and to sample the geology, flora and fauna. The expeditions lasted till 1902, leading to charts covering 260,000 km, more than any other Arctic expedition.\n\n[8] Bowdoin (Arctic schooner): \"Bowdoin\" first crossed the Arctic Circle on 23 August 1921. A place unknown to most of the world, the Arctic had had few visitors. Only sixteen years before, the goal of many generations of Arctic explorers had been reached when a northwest passage was traversed — a route which was, practically speaking, unusable, and after the construction of the Panama Canal, no longer necessary. Peary's North Pole expedition was merely a dozen years past. The last few Hudson's Bay and Davis Strait whalers had made their final trip home two years before.\n\n[9] Arctic ecology: In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, English scientist William Scoresby explored the Arctic and wrote reports on its meteorology, zoology and geophysics. Around this time, the Arctic region was becoming a major subject of imperial science. Though permanent observatories were not yet established, traveling scientists began to gather magnetic data in the Arctic in the early nineteenth century. In June 1831, Sir James Ross and a group of Eskimos explored the Booth Peninsula in order to determine the exact location of the Magnetic North Pole. In the European Arctic, however, Scandinavian powers collected most of the scientific data as a result of early colonies established by Norsemen in Iceland and Greenland. Scientific expeditions to the Arctic started to happen more frequently by the middle of the nineteenth century. From 1338-1840, French La Recherche went on an expedition to the North Atlantic with a team of French, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish scientists. Between 1856 and 1914, the Swedes made about twenty-five expeditions to the Arctic island of Spitsbergen in Norway. As the Swedes expanded their influence in Spitsbergen, they used the area for economic as well as scientific motives through mining and resource extraction. During this time, the United States, Russia, Great Britain, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Germany also started to become more active in Spitsbergen.\n\n[10] McClure Arctic Expedition: The McClure Arctic Expedition of 1850, among numerous British search efforts to determine the fate of the Franklin's lost expedition, is distinguished as the voyage during which Robert McClure became the first person to confirm and transit the Northwest Passage by a combination of sea travel and sledging. McClure and his crew spent three years locked in the pack ice aboard before abandoning it and making their escape across the ice. Rescued by , which was itself later lost to the ice, McClure returned to England in 1854, where he was knighted and rewarded for completing the passage.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was the first arctic expedition?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

During this summit, NATO leaders reaffirmed their support for building stability in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, and commit to strengthening the partnership between NATO and the European Union.\n\n[2] 2008 Bucharest summit: The 2008 Bucharest Summit or the 20th NATO Summit was a NATO summit organized in the Palace of the Parliament, Bucharest, Romania on 2 – 4 April 2008. Among other business, Croatia and Albania were invited to join the alliance. Macedonia was not invited due to its ongoing naming dispute with Greece. Georgia and Ukraine had hoped to join the NATO Membership Action Plan, but the NATO members decided to review their request in December 2008.\n\n[3] 1997 Madrid summit: The 1997 Madrid summit was a NATO summit held in Madrid, Spain from 8–9 July 1997. It was the 15th NATO summit and the second in 1997, the previous one being held in Paris. The summit was notable for inviting three new members, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to join the alliance.\n\n[4] 2014 Wales summit: The 2014 Wales Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was a meeting of the heads of state and heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, held in Newport, Wales on 4 and 5 September 2014. Such summits are sporadically held, and allow leaders and officials from NATO Allies to discuss current issues of mutual concern and to plan strategic activities. The 2014 summit has been described by US Navy Admiral James Stavridis as the most important since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n[5] December 1989 Brussels summit: The December 1989 NATO summit was a summit held for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The summit was held in Brussels, Belgium. This summit was the tenth NATO summit to bring world leaders from NATO together. Manfred Wörner headed the summit, and there were sixteen NATO members when the summit was held.\n\n[6] 2018 Arab League summit: The 2018 Arab League Summit (also known as the Dhahran Summit or Dammam Summit) was the Arab League's 29th summit held in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia on Sunday, 15 April 2018. The Summit was initially expected to be held in Riyadh. A preparatory meeting was held in Riyadh on Thursday, 12 April 2018 which was presided over by the Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir. Foreign Ministers of the 22 countries attended the meeting. The summit was announced to be held at the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture which was constructed by Saudi Aramco and was opened in 2016. As a security measure a number of roads were closed for traffic in the Dammam-Dhahran-Khobar region. It was also declared that all educational institutions would remain closed on Sunday.\n\n[7] 2016 Warsaw summit: Polish president Andrzej Duda announced in August 2015 that NATO bases in Central Europe were a priority for the Warsaw Summit.Normally NATO summits take place every two years, but after the Warsaw summit it was announced that the next alliance summit (28th) would take place in 2017 in Brussels to inaugurate the new €1 billion NATO headquarters building.\n\n[8] 2006 Riga summit: The 2006 Riga summit or the 19th NATO Summit was a NATO summit held in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga, Latvia from 28 to 29 November 2006. The most important topics discussed were the War in Afghanistan and the future role and borders of the alliance. Further, the summit focused on the alliance's continued transformation, taking stock of what has been accomplished since the 2002 Prague Summit. NATO also committed itself to extend further membership invitations in the upcoming 2008 Bucharest Summit. This summit was the first NATO summit held on territory of a former USSR republic.\n\n[9] 2002 Prague summit: The 2002 Prague summit was a NATO summit held at the where the heads of state and government of the NATO member states met.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat does a high emotional IQ mean?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Race and intelligence: Twin studies of intelligence have reported high heritability values. However, these studies are based on questionable assumptions. When used in the context of human behavior genetics, the term \"heritability\" is highly misleading, as it does not convey any information about the relative importance of genetic or environmental factors on the development of a given trait, nor does it convey the extent to which that trait is genetically determined. Arguments in support of a genetic explanation of racial differences in IQ are sometimes fallacious. For instance, hereditarians have sometimes cited the failure of known environmental factors to account for such differences, or the high heritability of intelligence within races, as evidence that racial differences in IQ are genetic.\n\n[2] Well-being contributing factors: Research suggests neither a good education nor a high IQ reliably increases happiness. Anders Ericsson argued an IQ above 120 has a decreasing influence on success. Presumably, IQs above 120 do not additionally cause other happiness indicators like success (with the exception of careers like Theoretical physics, where high IQs are more predictive of success). Above that IQ level, other factors, like social skills and a good mentor, matter more. As these relate to happiness, intelligence and education may simply allow one to reach a middle-class level of need satisfaction (as mentioned above, being richer than this seems to hardly affect happiness). According to the findings of the study, Using Theatrical Concepts for Role-plays with Educational Agents by Klesen, she expresses how role- playing embeds information and educational goals and causes people to learn unintentionally. Studies has shown that enjoyment in things as simple as role playing increases a person's IQ and their happiness.\n\n[3] Intelligence quotient: Psychometricians generally regard IQ tests as having high statistical reliability. A high reliability implies that – although test-takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, and although they may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same age – the scores generally agree with one another and across time. Like all statistical quantities, any particular estimate of IQ has an associated standard error that measures uncertainty about the estimate. For modern tests, the standard error of measurement is about three points . Clinical psychologists generally regard IQ scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes. In a survey of 661 randomly sampled psychologists and educational researchers, published in 1988, Mark Snyderman and Stanley Rothman reported a general consensus supporting the validity of IQ testing. \"On the whole, scholars with any expertise in the area of intelligence and intelligence testing (defined very broadly) share a common view of the most important components of intelligence, and are convinced that it can be measured with some degree of accuracy.\" Almost all respondents picked out abstract reasoning, ability to solve problems and ability to acquire knowledge as the most important elements. Since the early 20th century, raw scores on IQ tests have increased in most parts of the world. When a new version of an IQ test is normed, the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of IQ 100.\n\n[4] The Bell Curve: According to Herrnstein and Murray, the high heritability of IQ within races does not necessarily mean that the cause of differences between races is genetic. On the other hand, they discuss lines of evidence that have been used to support the thesis that the black-white gap is at least partly genetic, such as Spearman's hypothesis. They also discuss possible environmental explanations of the gap, such as the observed generational increases in IQ, for which they coin the term Flynn effect. At the close of this discussion, they write:\n\n[5] High-functioning autism: High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \"higher functioning\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10.\n\n[6] Psychology of education: A study done in Germany proved how education did affect the intelligence of students and proof of intelligence affecting education was seen in the military where people with lesser intelligence had slower learning and benefited less from education. Typically if the maternal IQ is high, it is very likely for the child to have a high IQ as well. A a study conducted by Plug and Vijverberg showed that the environment that a child grows up in also affects his or her future academic performance. The children that were raised by their biological parents had a greater similarity in terms of intelligence and academic performance to their families than those raised by foster parents. An other study was conducted by Campbell and Ramey to test the socioeconomic effect on intelligence and it showed promising results for children at high risk of academic failure when there was an early intervention. Therefore, the determining factor for what results in a persons intelligence basically boils down to the genetics of the subject in question and the environment they were raised in.\n\n[7] Maladjustment: Children with physical, emotional or mental problems often have a hard time keeping up socially when compared to their peers. This can cause a child to experience feeling of isolation and limits interaction which brings about maladjustment. Emotion regulation plays a role in maladjustment. Typically, emotions are generally adaptive responses which allow an individual to have the flexibility to change their emotion based on the demand of their environment. Emotional inertia refers to \"the degree in which emotional states are resistant to change\"; there is a lack of emotional responsiveness due to the resistance of external environmental changes or internal psychological influences. High level of emotional inertia may be indicative of maladjustment, as an individual does not display a typical variability of emotions towards their social surroundings. A high level of emotional inertia may also represent impairment in emotional-regulation skill, which is known to be indicators or low self-esteem and neuroticism.\n\n[8] Emotional intelligence: According to a popular science book by the journalist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ. Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI. This measured by self-reports and different work performance indicators, such as wages, promotions and salary increase. According to Lopes and his colleagues (2006), EI contributes to develop strong and positive relationships with co-workers and perform efficiently in work teams. This benefits performance of workers by providing emotional support and instrumental resources needed to succeed in their roles. Also, emotional intelligent employees have better resources to cope with stressing situations and demanding tasks, which enable them to outperform in those situations. For instance, Law et al. (2004) found that EI was the best predictor of job performance beyond general cognitive ability among IT scientist in computer company in China. Similarly, Sy, Tram, and O’Hara (2006) found that EI was associated positively with job performance in employees from a food service company.\n\n[9] Emotional intelligence: Research of EI and job performance shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one. This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006) to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, & Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.\n\n[10] Emotional intelligence: Studies have shown that people with high EI have greater mental health, job performance, and leadership skills although no causal relationships have been shown and such findings are likely to be attributable to general intelligence and specific personality traits rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ. Other research finds that the effect of EI on leadership and managerial performance is non-significant when ability and personality are controlled for, and that general intelligence correlates very closely with leadership. Markers of EI and methods of developing it have become more widely coveted in the past decade. In addition, studies have begun to provide evidence to help characterize the neural mechanisms of emotional intelligence.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhat does a high emotional IQ mean?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

At a meeting in November 2007 the Campaign reiterated its policy as formulated in the appeal.\n\n[2] Reactions to Kauhajoki school shooting: After the incident a crisis meeting was held, with government ministers, chairs of the parliamentary groups, and police officials all in attendance. Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described it as a \"tragic day\" and appealed for unity in the hope \"that events like these will not happen again.\" A national day of mourning was declared for the following day, and Vanhanen travelled to Kauhajoki to meet with students.\n\n[3] Robert F. Kennedy: George Plimpton, former decathlete Rafer Johnson, and former professional football player Rosey Grier are credited with wrestling Sirhan to the ground after he shot the senator. As Kennedy lay mortally wounded, Juan Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, \"Is everybody OK?\", and Romero responded, \"Yes, everybody's OK.\" Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, \"Everything's going to be OK.\" After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted the senator onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, \"Don't lift me\", which were his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. He was rushed first to Los Angeles' Central Receiving Hospital, and then to the city's Good Samaritan Hospital. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. (PDT) on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting.\n\n[4] Prime Minister of Australia: Ben Chifley lived the least of all former prime ministers, as he died one year and six months after his term as prime minister. All other deceased former prime ministers have lived at least another 10 years, with the longest surviving former prime minister being Gough Whitlam, who lived 38 years and 11 months after office, surpassing Stanley Bruce's previous record of 37 years and 10 months.\n\n[5] Robert F. Kennedy 1968 presidential campaign: After addressing his supporters during the early morning hours of June 5, in a ballroom at The Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, Kennedy left the ballroom through a service area to greet kitchen workers. In a crowded kitchen passageway, Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian-born Jordanian, opened fire with a .22 caliber revolver and mortally wounded Kennedy. Following the shooting, Kennedy was rushed to Central Receiving Hospital and then transferred to The Good Samaritan Hospital, where he died early in the morning on June 6. Kennedy's body was returned to New York City, where he lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral for several days before the Requiem Mass was held there on June 8. His younger brother, U.S. Senator Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy, eulogized him with the words: \"My brother need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\" Kennedy concluded the eulogy by paraphrasing George Bernard Shaw, \"As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: 'Some men see things as they are and say why? I dream things that never were and say why not?' \" Later that day, a funeral train carried Kennedy's body from New York to Washington,\n\n[6] Sharad Pawar: During the course of the 1991 election campaign, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. There were reports in the media that Pawar's name was being considered for the prime minister's post, along with those of P.V. Narasimha Rao and N.D. Tiwari, in the event of a Congress victory. However the Congress Parliamentary Party (party MPs) elected P.V. Narasimha Rao as its leader and he was sworn in as prime minister on 21 June 1991. Rao named Pawar as Defence Minister. On 26 June 1991, Pawar took over that portfolio, continuing till March 1993. After Pawar's successor in Maharashtra, Sudhakarrao Naik, stepped down, Rao sent Pawar back as chief minister of the state.\n\n[7] Prime Minister of Canada: Should a serving or former prime minister die, he or she is accorded a state funeral, wherein their casket lies in state in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill. Only Bowell and the Viscount Bennett were given private funerals, Bennett also being the only former Prime Minister of Canada to die and be buried outside the country and Bowell the only whose funeral was not attended by politicians. John Thompson also died outside Canada, at Windsor Castle, where Queen Victoria permitted his lying-in-state before his body was returned to Canada for a state funeral in Halifax.\n\n[8] 2013 Guinea clashes: Further tension was seen in the week after the riots, when thousands of opposition supporters marched in Conakry to mark the funerals of the nine people who died during the protests. Former Prime Minister Celou Dalein Diallo, now an opposition leader, gave a speech at the event, urging solidarity and unity after a week of violence. Despite the peaceful proceedings, security forces fired warning shots and tear gas to disperse the crowds, with one resident claiming shots were still heard, even after the crowds had left.\n\n[9] People's Mujahedin of Iran: Lt. Col. Louis Lee Hawkins, a U.S. Army comptroller, was shot to death in front of his home in Tehran by two men on a motorcycle on June 2, 1973. A car carrying U.S. Air Force officers Col. Paul R. Shaffer and Lt. Col. Jack Turner was trapped between two cars carrying armed men. They told the Iranian driver to lie down and then shot and killed the Americans. Six hours later a woman called reporters to claim the MEK carried out the attack as retaliation for the recent death of prisoners at the hands of Iranian authorities. A car carrying three American employees of Rockwell International was attacked in August 1976. William Cottrell, Donald Smith, and Robert Krongard were killed. They had been working on the Ibex system for gathering intelligence on the neighboring USSR. Leading up to the Islamic Revolution, members of the MEK, conducted attacks and assassinations against both Iranian and Western targets. According to the U.S. Department of State and the presentation of the MEK by the Foreign Affairs group of the Australian Parliament, the group conducted several assassinations of U.S. military personnel and civilians working in Iran during the 1970s. After the revolution the group actively supported the U.S. embassy takeover in Tehran in 1979.\n\n[10] 2014 Indian National Congress campaign for Indian general election: Former prime ministerial adviser Sanjaya Baru published a book titled \"The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh\" in which he criticised Singh for not being \"fully in charge of his government in having to compete with the dynastic INC leader, Sonia Gandhi, for influence within his own cabinet.\" Singh's office retorted in saying it is \"smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser.\" After Baru said \"it is no secret that Sonia Gandhi was the super prime minister,\" Priyanka Vadra replied \"I think Manmohan Singh ji is the super PM.\" The opposition targeted Sonia Gandhi on the basis of this book.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhich nation's former Prime Minister tragically died after being shot at a campaign event?\n\nI will wait for your response before providing the next question.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

She represented the state of Haryana at the Femina Miss India 2017 pageant in which she won. Chhillar is the sixth representative from India to win the Miss World pageant. She was signed up as a brand ambassador for Malabar Gold and Diamonds, one of the world's largest retail jewellery groups. Chhillar was named as the 'Times Most Desirable Woman of India 2017'. She was also featured in a television commercial for Club Factory.\n\n[2] Miss World: Miss World is the oldest running international beauty pageant. It was created in the United Kingdom by Eric Morley in 1951. Since his death in 2000, Morley's widow, Julia Morley, has co-chaired the pageant. Along with Miss Universe and Miss International, Miss World is one of 3 most prestigious recognized beauty pageants in the international scale. The current Miss World is Vanessa Ponce of Mexico who was crowned on 8 December 2018 in Sanya, China. She is the first Mexican woman to win Miss World.\n\n[3] Miss World 2009: Miss World 2009, the 59th edition of the Miss World pageant, was held on 12 December 2009 at the Gallagher Convention Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa. 112 contestants from all over the world competed for the crown, marking the biggest turnout in the pageant's history. Ksenia Sukhinova of Russia crowned her successor Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar at the end of event. It is the first time that someone from Gibraltar won Miss World. In the past, people from mainland Britain have won.\n\n[4] Rosemarie Frankland: Born in Rhosllannerchrugog, Denbighshire, in north-east Wales in 1943, Frankland moved to Lancashire, England, as a child. She took part in many beauty pageants and won the title of Miss Wales and, later in 1961 in London, she became (as Miss United Kingdom) the first British woman and the seventh European (Sweden won the two first contests, France won in 1953, Germany three years later, Finland in 1957 and the Netherlands in 1959) to win the Miss World competition. She also was the first runner-up at Miss Universe 1961. Together with Gina Swainson, who won the Miss World title as Miss Bermuda in 1979, Frankland is one of the two women who came closest to winning both Miss Universe and Miss World, having been second at Miss Universe before winning Miss World. Helen Morgan who was also Miss Wales and Miss United Kingdom, achieved the same feat, but she resigned the Miss World title four days after being crowned. It is worth noting that all three would not have been able to go on to Miss World had they won Miss Universe.\n\n[5] Miss World 2018: In March 2018, Miss World President Julia Morley signed the contract with Jiajun Li, President of New Silk Road company, to host once again the Miss World finals in China. Miss France, Maëva Coucke won the Top Model Competition and became the first quarter-finalist of Miss World 2018. Miss Japan, Kanako Date won the Talent Competition and became the second quarter-finalist of Miss World 2018. Miss United States, Marisa Butler won the Sports Competition and became the third quarter-finalist of Miss World 2018.\n\n[6] Miss World 2018: Miss World 2018, the 68th edition of the Miss World pageant, was held on 8 December 2018 at the Sanya City Arena in Sanya, China.

The book, published by Bloomsbury, explores what it means to be Jewish today and is also about \"love, loss and male friendship\". Andrew Motion, the chair of the judges, said: \"\"The Finkler Question\" is a marvellous book: very funny, of course, but also very clever, very sad and very subtle. It is all that it seems to be and much more than it seems to be. A completely worthy winner of this great prize.\" His novel \"Zoo Time\" won the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize (2013), Jacobson's second time winning the prize (the first in 1999 for \"The Mighty Walzer\").\n\n[2] Alan Jacobson (writer): In 1998, Simon & Schuster's Pocket Books imprint inked Jacobson to a solid six-figure deal for two thrillers, False Accusations and The Hunted. The former was originally published by a small Canadian publisher, Commonwealth, that went into bankruptcy just as it was preparing to ship books to stores. Jacobson was able to get them to distribute a fraction of the first printing and it caught on and sold well. But retailers were unable to order additional copies and Jacobson had to sue Commonwealth by hiring a Canadian law firm. He ultimately won the case and the rights reverted to him, thanks to a clause inserted by his entertainment law attorney, Robert Youdelman, Esq. His agent then sold the rights to Emily Bestler, then vice president and editor-in-chief of Pocket Books. This resulted in the two-book deal that included The Hunted (later rebranded as book one of the OPSIG Team Black series).\n\n[3] Abbi Jacobson: In 2013, Jacobson published two coloring books with Chronicle Books: \"Color This Book: New York City\" and \"Color This Book: San Francisco\". Jacobson also illustrated a book titled \"Carry This Book,\" published October 2016 by Viking Press. It features colorful, humorous illustrations of the imagined contents of various celebrities' bags. \"I have always been intrigued by what people carry around with them. It can tell you everything\" says Jacobson in the book's introduction. Well-received by critics, \"Carry This Book\" was a \"New York Times\" bestseller.\n\n[4] Alan Jacobson (writer): Jacobson never intended to write a series. He had seen colleagues become stale writing the same character in the same setting, essentially writing the same book over and over. When approached by his publisher, Roger Cooper, who was prepping The 7th Victim for production, Cooper asked when the next book in the Karen Vail series would be ready. Jacobson told him that The 7th Victim was a one-off, a standalone novel. Cooper told him all the sales reps and bookstores loved Vail and wanted more. Jacobson said he would have to think about it and figure out a way of keeping Vail, and himself, fresh from book to book. About a week later, he figured out how to make that happen and the Karen Vail series was born. In retrospect, Jacobson credited Cooper in the acknowledgments to No Way Out (Vail #5), stating that without Cooper's urging, the adventures he has had so much fun writing might never have occurred.\n\n[5] Alan Jacobson (writer): Two of Jacobson's short stories have been published. The first, Fatal Twist, features FBI profiler Karen Vail and was published by the Strand magazine in 2012. The second, Double Take, features two characters from the Karen Vail series, Carmine Russo and Ben Dyer from Spectrum. Russo and Dyer were created for the short story, and were later integrated into Spectrum for the novel. Double Take what originally bundled with Hard Target (OPSIG #2) as a value-added bonus for the ebook release. It was subsequently sold separately.\n\n[6] Alan Jacobson (writer): Twenty years later, in the early stages of his writing career, Jacobson realized the professor had a point. If you were going to write about something like war and abdominal wounds, you needed to know what you were talking about. While writing his first published novel, False Accusations, his path crossed that of the head of the California Department of Justice. During a phone call with Jacobson, he requested a reference on one of Jacobson's employees who was applying to be a forensic scientist. Jacobson then asked the director a question about a novel he was writing (False Accusations) involving the character of Ryan Chandler.\n\n[7] Alan Jacobson (writer): Jacobson's relates a story regarding Steve Martini. While an aspiring writer, Jacobson was addicted to Steve Martini novels. When Martini did a book signing at Barnes & Noble, Jacobson attended. While Martini was signing the hardcover to him, Jacobson asked him for advice on getting published. About ten years later, while at the ThrillerFest writers conference in New York City, Jacobson felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see his publisher, Roger Cooper of Vanguard Press, standing with Martini. Cooper introduced the two men and Jacobson mentioned that they had met many years earlier at a signing. Weeks later, he asked if Martini would read his new manuscript, Crush. Martini loved the book and wrote a testimonial blurb for it, which appeared on the Crush hardcover jacket. The following year at ThrillerFest, Jacobson was standing at the elevators when he again felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see Steve Martini standing there with a copy of Crush. He asked Jacobson to autograph it for him. He felt like he had come full circle as a writer.\n\n[8] Alan Jacobson (writer): Being new to writing a series, Jacobson consulted with both Michael Connelly and Lee Child for advice on what to do and what to avoid. He received completely opposing answers: Connelly suggested he write the best book he can at the time, put everything in it, and worry about the next book later. Child, on the other hand, advocated doling out the information one book at a time, spreading out the revelations a little at a time, with each novel. Jacobson realized that the reason for the difference in their perspectives was the nature of their characters: Harry Bosch is a grounded, career law enforcement officer who follows rules, while Jack Reacher is a drifter who has no rules to follow. Based on this Jacobson felt that Connelly's style fit more with what Jacobson intended for Vail as a series character.\n\n[9] Alan Jacobson (writer): Jacobson and retired FBI profiler Mark Safarik co-authored a book on personal safety entitled, “Staying Safe: from serial killers to identity thieves, a primer to keep you out of criminals’ crosshairs.” The book came about because of an interview Jacobson and Safarik did for The 7th Victim. They were discussing what steps a woman could take to prevent herself from falling victim to the tactics the killer uses in the opening scene. Afterwards, they realized it was important information that everyone should have. They set out to write an article but found they had too much information and ultimately wrote a book. It is updated periodically and given away for free on Jacobson's website as an incentive for readers to sign up for his author newsletter.\n\n[10] Abbi Jacobson: Jacobson published another book, \"I Might Regret This: Essays, Drawings, Vulnerabilities, and Other Stuff.\" The book was published on October 30, 2018 with Grand Central Publishing. With drawings throughout, the book of personal essays is centred around Jacobson's solo three week cross-country road trip. The 320 pages of personal essays and various short stories, although some are comical in nature, largely focus on Jacobson getting over her first love, first relationship with a woman, and general issues of identity. According to Jacobson, book is centred around self reflection: \"It's about how I've felt like an internal outsider for my entire life because I just never understood what love was, that I would never get to experience it, and being a public figure only heightened that anxiety.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, Alan Jacobson's first published book was \"False Accusations\".", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nThe answer to the question \"What was Alan Jacobson's first published book?\" is present in context [2].

His brother John was the patriarch of the Massareene family. William was appointed High Sheriff of Leicestershire and Warwickshire for 1508, 1515 and 1521 in the reign of Henry VII and was knighted by that king for his services. In 1523, he received from Henry VIII property near Tunbridge that had belonged to the executed traitor Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham.\n\n[2] Anthony Skeffington: He was born in Skeffington, Leicestershire. He was a cousin (possibly a brother) of Sir William Skeffington, who served as Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1529–32 and 1534–5, and he probably came to Ireland in William's retinue.

He inherited his father's titles in the Peerage of Ireland in 1863. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Louth between 13 November 1879 and March 1898. He served in the Antrim Militia Artillery at Carrickfergus Castle, which had been commanded by his father, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant himself on 20 November 1872.\n\n[6] Clotworthy Skeffington, 1st Earl of Massereene: Massereene was the son of Clotworthy Skeffington, 4th Viscount Massereene and Lady Catherine Chichester, daughter of Arthur Chichester, 3rd Earl of Donegall. He succeeded to his father's title in 1738 and assumed his seat in the Irish House of Lords. He was made a Member of the Privy Council of Ireland in 1746, and on 28 July 1756 he was created Earl of Massereene in the Peerage of Ireland. He died suddenly just over a year later.\n\n[7] Frank Skeffington Carroll: Carroll was born in Ireland, the second son of Bernard Carroll of Dublin.\n\n[8] Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington: Hanna Sheehy was born in Kanturk, County Cork, Ireland, the eldest daughter of Elizabeth \"Bessie\" McCoy and David Sheehy, an ex-Fenian and an MP for the Irish Parliamentary Party, representing South Galway. Hanna spent her earliest years on a millhouse which her father also grew up on. When Hanna was three years old the family relocated to Loughmore, Tipperary. Hanna had six siblings, one of whom died at an unknown age; there is very little written about this child. Her siblings were Margaret, born 1875; Eugene, born 1882; Richard, born 1884; Mary, born 1884; and Kathleen, born 1886. One of her uncles, Father Eugene Sheehy, was known as the Land League Priest, and his activities landed him in prison. He was also one of Éamon de Valera's teachers in Limerick.\n\n[9] Francis Sheehy-Skeffington: Francis Sheehy Skeffington was born in Bailieborough, County Cavan, the only son of Joseph Skeffington, a school inspector, and Rose Magorian of County Down.

He enters Kvothe's narrative in Tarbean as an eccentric old man who will tell any story asked of him. Although it seems at first glance that he's just a mere rumor monger, in the later parts of the story it is hinted that he has actual knowledge of his stories and that his stories at least contains fragments of truths.\n\n[2] The Kingkiller Chronicle: Ambrose Jakis: Kvothe's rival at the University, and the firstborn son of a powerful and wealthy baron. Throughout the story, Ambrose and Kvothe often commit sabotage and subterfuge against each other. While their rivalry earlier on is mostly displayed by playing pranks on each other, it later escalates to physical violence between the two of them with each other trying to outwit the other by being clever about their tactics.\n\n[3] The Kingkiller Chronicle: Kvothe: Kvothe, pronounced nearly the same as \"quothe\" with the \"kv\" sounding as in the Yiddish \"kvetch\" and the e being silent, is the protagonist of \"The Kingkiller Chronicle\". At the young age of twelve he is orphaned and forced to survive alone in the streets of Tarbean as a beggar. His most prominent physical features are his red hair and green eyes. Kvothe is a prodigy in the arts and arcane magics with an extraordinary memory - his prodigious feats earning him an admission at the University and helping him become an infamous student during his stay. Later on, he receives informal training from an Adem mercenary and teacher, developing his martial arts education and skill. He is a very talented lute player, becoming a well known performer at the pubs in Imre which becomes his main source of income. At the later part of the story, he becomes an arcanist, a renowned musician, a quasi-noble, and a novice adventurer. His extraordinary adventuring feats leads him to becomes a mythical figure throughout the people of Temerant - the stories of his adventures being exaggerated although very few people seem to know him and the truths behind the stories.\n\n[4] The Kingkiller Chronicle: Their architecture exhibits pragmatism, with the buildings being built by utilizing dry stone with the purpose of blending with the landscape. The society of Adem is matriarchal and governed by a modified Federal political system (as schools governs their respective area within Ademre), however the stability of their societal system is largely based on their understanding of the Lethani philosophy and conflicts are settled according to the administration of the philosophy by the respective school leader. It is hinted throughout Kvothe's stay at the Ademre that the culture of Adem emphasizes femininity and that the children are cultivated at a young age to become 'war children' as they undergo an almost militaristic training provided by the Adem schools using their respective martial arts curriculum based on the Ketan and their own variations of the Lethani philosophy. However, the Adem people does not view the cultivation of war children as a bad thing (partly due to their Lethani philosophy), instead it is a pragmatic decision by them as their main form of income to support their society comes from their exported Adem mercenaries that sends money to their schools as part of their repayment.\n\n[5] The Kingkiller Chronicle: In July 2013, 20th Century Fox announced that \"The\" \"Kingkiller Chronicle\" was optioned for a TV series. The production team included Arnon Milchan, Andrew Plotkin, Brad Weston, and Robert Lawrence. The option expired by October 2015, and the rights to the books reverted to Rothfuss.\n\n[6] The Slow Regard of Silent Things: The writing occasionally slips into a poetic flow when describing the little things in Auri's day-to-day life. As Patrick Rothfuss himself says, the book does not do what a \"proper book should do\", so that it actually doesn't have a very proper plot. The story cannot clearly be divided into a beginning, middle and end, and does not have a proper climax. While \"The Kingkiller Chronicle\" books develop a plot and multiple characters, this novella explores one character, describing the day-to-day life of the protagonist, showing her view of the world and the way her mind works.\n\n[7] The Kingkiller Chronicle: Auri: A young woman and likely former student who lives in hiding in The Underthing. Auri is frightened by strangers, loud noises, and direct questions, but is befriended by Kvothe. Her name is bestowed by Kvothe himself, in a language he does not remember, meaning \"sunny\". Kvothe calls her his \"little moon fae\" and plays his lute for her in the middle of the night.\n\n[8] The Kingkiller Chronicle: The Kingkiller Chronicle is a fantasy series by Patrick Rothfuss, which recounts the story of Kvothe, an adventurer and musician. The story is narrated from the third person, but mostly consists of Kvothe narrating his life to a scribe in the first person. The first two books, \"The Name of the Wind\" and \"The Wise Man's Fear\", were released in 2007 and 2011, respectively and a third novel titled the Doors of Stone is still to be released. Collectively, the book series has sold over 10 million copies.\n\n[9] Hannibal Lecter: \"Red Dragon\" firmly states that Lecter does not fit any known psychological profile. In \"The Silence of the Lambs\", Lecter's keeper, Dr. Frederick Chilton, claims that Lecter is a \"pure sociopath\" (\"pure psychopath\" in the film adaptation). In the novel \"Red Dragon\", protagonist Will Graham says that Lecter has no conscience and tortured animals as a child, but does not exhibit any other of the criteria traditionally associated with sociopathy; Graham explains that psychiatrists refer to Lecter as a sociopath because \"they don't know what else to call him\". In the film adaptation of \"The Silence of the Lambs\", protagonist Clarice Starling says of Lecter, \"They don't have a name for what he is.\"\n\n[10] The Kingkiller Chronicle: Skarpi tells a tale of Lord Haliax's origins as Lanre, legendary warrior, hero of the embattled Ergen Empire, and husband to the sorceress Lyra. Lanre is killed in the battle, but Lyra revives him with her magic, and they go on to win the war. However, after the war, Lyra dies mysteriously, and Lanre finds himself unable to revive her despite gaining great powers. Filled with despair, he changes his name to Haliax and resolves to destroy the world, betraying the great cities of Ergen. While destroying the last city, Myr Tariniel, Lanre reveals to its king Selitos that his power has rendered him unable to sleep, forget, go mad, or die. Selitos curses Haliax to be surrounded by shadow and troubled by any mention of his name, extending the curse eternally on Haliax and his followers. Another of Skarpi's tales has Selitos gathering Myr Tariniel's survivors to form the Amyr, sworn to hunt the Chandrian whenever and wherever they can.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Serge's wife Liuba had long been confined to a mental institution-their daughter was being cared for by a couple in the country. (Liuba remained in France until her death in 1985. Jeannine was brought to Mexico by Laurette Séjourné in 1942 and lived there until her death in 2011). Serge, Vlady and Laurette spent the winter of 1940–41 at the Villa Air Bel in , which they shared with Varian Fry, of the American Rescue Committee, the Surrealist André Breton and his family, Daniel Bénédite, Mary Jayne Gold and others. With both the Gestapo and the GPU on his trail, Serge was desperate to leave France, but as an undocumented Russian with a Communist past, he faced the nightmare of what Trotsky famously called 'A world without a visa'. At the last possible moment, thanks to the efforts of Dwight and Nancy MacDonald in New York and Julián Gorkin and Wolfgang Paalen in Mexico, Serge and Vlady took the last ship out of Marseille (on which Breton and the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss were cabin passengers). After a six-month journey to the Caribbean, they were imprisoned in Martinique and the Dominican Republic, and arriving in Mexico several months after Trotsky's assassin\n\n[2] Nikolai Kibalchich: Nikolai Ivanovich Kibalchich (, , \"Mykola Ivanovych Kybalchych\"; 19 October 1853 – April 3, 1881) was a Russian revolutionary of Ukrainian origin who took part in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II as the main explosive expert for Narodnaya Volya (the People's Will), and was also a rocket pioneer. He was the paternal uncle of revolutionary Victor Serge.\n\n[3] Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov: Vladimir Victorovich Kibalchich Rusakov (; June 15, 1920 – July 21, 2005) was a Russian-Mexican painter, known simply as \"Vlady\" in Mexico. He came to Mexico as a refugee from Russia together with his father, writer Victor Serge. Attracted to painting from his exposure in Europe, Vlady quickly became part of Mexico’s artistic and intellectual scene, with his first individual exhibition in 1945, two years after his arrival to the country.\n\n[4] Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov: Due to pressure from writers and intellectuals such as André Malraux, the family was allowed to leave the Soviet Union in 1936. They lived for a few months in Belgium before moving to France. At this time, Vlady became militantly in favor of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, he did not go and join the war because of his age. His time in Belgium and France gave him his first experience with modern art, which inspired him to become a painter. In Paris, Vlady began to study in the workshops of various painters there such as Victor Brauner, Wifredo Lam, Joseph Lacasse, André Masson and Aristide Maillol. He continued to do so until 1941, when the imminent German invasion of France forced the family to move again as refugees.\n\n[5] Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov: In 2004, he donated most of his art collection, a total of 4,600 paintings, drawings and engravings to the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. About 1,000 pieces are part of the Centro Vlady at the Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México (UACM). The center’s mission is to safeguard, do research and promote Vlady’s life’s work as well as that of his father Victor Serge. The center was inaugurated with his widow Isabel Díaz Fabela and his nephew Carlos Díaz in July 2005. The center has a permanent collection of 318 paintings, 245 engravings, lithographs and linoleum etchings, 63 oils and 376 drawings and watercolors. It is not exactly a museum although it does sponsor research, exhibition and promotion of the artist’s work.\n\n[6] Victor Serge: Victor Serge (), born Victor Lvovich Kibalchich (; December 30, 1890 – November 17, 1947), was a Russian revolutionary and writer. Originally an anarchist, he joined the Bolsheviks five months after arriving in Petrograd in January 1919 and later worked for the Comintern as a journalist, editor and translator. He was critical of the Stalinist regime and remained a revolutionary Marxist until his death. He is best remembered for his \"Memoirs of a Revolutionary\" and series of seven 'witness-novels' chronicling the lives of revolutionaries of the first half of the 20th Century.\n\n[7] Victor Serge: Serge was born in Brussels, Belgium, to a couple of impoverished Russian anti-Czarist exiles. His father, Leo (Lev) Kibalchich, a former infantry trooper from Kiev, has been variously described as a distant relative or a cousin of Nikolai Kibalchich of the People's Will revolutionary organization, who was executed on a charge of being responsible for the bomb used in the assassination of Alexander II in 1881. Leo, himself a Peoples' Will sympathiser, had fled Russia around 1887 and gone to Switzerland, where he met Serge's mother, Vera Frolova, née Pederowska. She was the daughter of an impoverished petty nobleman of Polish extraction from the Nizhni-Novgorod province. Vera had married a Saint Petersburg official and, after giving birth to two daughters, had received permission to go to Switzerland to study and heal her consumptive lungs, but also to escape the reactionary environment of Saint Petersburg. She fell in love with the handsome, feckless Kibalchich, and the couple wandered Europe, according to their son, \"in search of cheap lodgings and good libraries\". Victor was born \"by chance\" in Brussels, where the couple were so poor that Victor's younger brother died of malnutrition before Leonid eventually found work as a teacher at the Institute of Anatomy. The \"Kibalchich myth\" of revolutionary idealism and sacrifice dominated Victor's impoverished childhood. He read a great deal,\n\n[8] Victor Serge: Serge's first published article was written in September 1908. Under the pen name \"\"Le Rétif\"\" (\"The Maverick\" or \"The Stubborn One\"), Serge wrote many articles for \"Le Révolté\" and, starting in 1909, \"L'Anarchie\", a journal founded by Albert Libertad, whom Serge and his friends considered to be a hero. Serge at this stage was an outspoken supporter of individualist anarchism and illegalism, often clashing with the editor of \"L'Anarchie\", André Roulot (aka \"Lorulot\"), who favoured less inflammatory rhetoric. In 1910, after a schism in \"L'Anarchie\", Lorulot departed and Serge was named as the new editor of the paper. During this time, Serge was in a relationship with Rirette Maitrejean, another anarchist activist.\n\n[9] Victor Serge: Expelled from France on his release in 1917, he moved to Spain, which was neutral in World War I but was the scene of an attempted syndicalist revolution. Around this time, he first used the name Victor Serge, as a pen name for an article in the newspaper \"Tierra y Libertad\".\n\n[10] Vlady Kibalchich Rusakov: Vlady was born on June 14, 1920 in Saint Petersburg, Russia (then called Petrograd), during the Russian Revolution. He was the son of writer and photographer Victor Napoleon Lvovich Kibalchich, better known as Victor Serge, and Liuba Rusakova.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.

In an interview with website Walfordweb, Matthew Robinson has stated that Melanie was \"dreamt up to supplement the 'totty' contingent – running thin at the time\".

The series revolves around the lives and romances of the privileged socialite teenagers at the Constance Billard School for Girls, an elite private school in New York City's Upper East Side. The books primarily focus on best friends Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen,whose experiences are among those chronicled by the eponymous gossip blogger. The novel series is based on the author, Cecily von Ziegesar, experiences at Nightingale-Bamford School and on what she heard from friends.\n\n[3] Valley Girls: Discussion about a \"Gossip Girl\" spin-off began in 2008. Despite believing the project was \"unlikely,\" \"Gossip Girl\" executives explored potential concepts including an adaptation of the \"Gossip Girl\" book series' spin-off, \"The It Girl\". However, they felt that \"The It Girl\"'s world, centered on character Jenny Humphrey's stay at boarding school, was too small and insular to sustain a television series. They were also concerned about disrupting \"Gossip Girl\"'s chemistry by taking away any of the show's cast members. In December 2009, \"Variety\" magazine reported that while the \"\"Gossip Girl\" spinoff [was] still in the very early stages of development\", CW had begun to consider making a backdoor pilot. Such a pilot would allow the company to evaluate viewer interest in a spin-off while saving money.\n\n[4] Gossip Girl (novel series): The novel that started the series, \"Gossip Girl,\" was published in paperback format in April 2002. Two new novels were released annually until the final novel, \"Don't You Forget About Me\", was released in May 2007, showing the main characters graduating from high school and moving on to college and other pursuits. A prequel novel, \"It Had To Be You\", was released in October 2007 in hardcover and electronic book format. It detailed the events that occurred a year before the first novel. A box set containing the eleven novels of the series and the prequel novel, in paperback format, was released November 1, 2009. Two days later, a sequel novel, \"I Will Always Love You\" was released. The hardcover book tells the story of the main characters returning home from college for the holidays. Hachette Group re-released all of the original novels in electronic book format between 2008 and 2009.\n\n[5] Gossip Girl: On January 26, 2012, in honor of the series' 100th episode, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the set and proclaimed the date \"Gossip Girl Day,\" citing the show's cultural influence and impact on the economy of the city. \"\"Gossip Girl\" has made New York a central character. While \"Gossip Girl\" is drawing fans in with its plot twists, the show also attracts many of them to visit New York, contributing to our incredible 50.5 million visitors last year. In fact, the economic impact of \"Gossip Girl\" and other television shows and films that are made in New York really can be felt directly in all five boroughs. The 100th episode of \"Gossip Girl\" is a real landmark, and I want to congratulate the show's cast and crew,\" he stated.\n\n[6] Gossip Girl (novel series): Pam Spencer Holley, former YALSA President with the American Library Association (ALA), presents a different point of view, claiming simply to be \"happy to see teen girls reading.\" Confident that young girls will move onto more respected literature, Holley points out, \"Unless you read stuff that's perhaps not the most literary, you'll never understand what good works are.\" She went on to say, \"Nobody complains about the adult women who read Harlequin romances.\" Holley created a new ALA book list to encourage teens to consult a list of recommendations for \"both avid and reluctant readers, who are looking for books like Cecily von Ziegesar's \"Gossip Girl\" series. 'The books on this list are perfect for when your readers have finished with every \"Gossip Girl\" title in your library and are clamoring for another book like the Gossip Girl...'\"\n\n[7] List of Gossip Girl episodes: \"Gossip Girl\" is a teen drama which premiered on September 19, 2007 in the United States on The CW. \"Gossip Girl\" is based on the young-adult book series of the same name written by Cecily von Ziegesar, and was developed for television by \"The O.C.\" creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage. The series follows the lives of the young, wealthy, and social elite residing in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and is narrated by an unseen and seemingly omniscient character, \"Gossip Girl\", whose blog is widely read among the characters.\n\n[8] Gossip Girl: The \"Gossip Girl\" book series was originally supposed to be adapted into a film starring Lindsay Lohan with head \"Gilmore Girls\" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. When the film project did not get off the ground, Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz took over the project to create a television series. As of October 2006, Schwartz was working on the pilot. He said, \"I was very skeptical. I don't want to do \"The O.C. NYC\". But I thought the books were smart. The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren't.\" The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first \"Gossip Girl\" book. In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.\n\n[9] Gossip Girl (novel series): In October 2011 a parody of the series G\"ossip Girl Psycho Killer\" was released. It is written by Cecily Von Zeigesar. The identity of Gossip Girl has not been released to the public.The criticism of the \"Gossip Girl\" series primarily revolves around whether the events depicted in the story are appropriate for the teenage audience the books attract. American author and feminist Naomi Wolf calls the books \"corruption with a cute overlay.\" Wolf also claims that \"sex saturates the \"Gossip Girl\" books... This is not the frank sexual exploration found in a Judy Blume novel, but teenage sexuality via Juicy Couture, blasé and entirely commodified.\"\n\n[10] Gossip Girl (novel series): In May 2008, a follow-up series, \"Gossip Girl: The Carlyles\", began publication, following the Carlyle triplets as they begin moving to the Upper East Side. As of October 2009, four novels have been released in this series. Ziegesar created a spin-off series, \"The It Girl\", which began publication in 2005, and Yen Press has adapted the series into a manga series titled \"Gossip Girl: For Your Eyes Only\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

As of 2018, \"Fate/Grand Order\" has grossed more than in worldwide revenue.\n\n[8] Arch/Matheos: Arch/Matheos began as a reunion between founding Fates Warning members John Arch and Jim Matheos, who hadn't collaborated since Arch's 2003 EP \"A Twist Of Fate\" and hadn't fully collaborated for a whole album since 1986's \"Awaken the Guardian\". In 2010, the duo began working on an album together and brought along three Fates Warning members to the fold. The five members would in turn release their debut album \"Sympathetic Resonance\" in 2011, under the name Arch/Matheos. The album, while only 6 tracks, clocked at 55 minutes.

A \"Doctor Fate\" limited series was released soon afterwards, which changed the character's secret identity. DC began a \"Doctor Fate\" ongoing series by J.M. DeMatteis and Shawn McManus in winter of 1988. William Messner-Loebs became the series’ writer with issue #25. When the series ended with issue #41, DC replaced the existing Doctor Fate with a new character, Jared Stevens. Stevens was introduced in a self-titled series called \"Fate\", launched in the wake of \"\" in 1994, which was cancelled after 23 issues in September 1996. The character then starred in \"The Book of Fate\", which ran from February 1997 to January 1998 for twelve issues as part of DC's \"Weirdoverse\" imprint. In 1999, the revival of the Justice Society in \"JSA\" allowed the character to be reworked again. In addition to appearing in \"JSA\", DC published a self-titled, five-issue limited series in 2003. The character was killed in the \"Day of Vengeance\" limited series in 2005 as part of the lead in to the 2005 company-wide event story, \"Infinite Crisis\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was The Guardians of Fate released?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, The Guardians of Fate was released in 2016.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "No, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWho won the 1988 Super Bowl?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Bill Romanowski: Romanowski played 243 consecutive games during the 1988-2003 seasons, an NFL record that stood until Chris Gardocki broke it during the 2006 season, finishing his career with 265, (256 reg. season and 9 playoff games). He won 4 Super Bowl Championships, and played 5 Super Bowls (Super Bowl XXIII, Super Bowl XXIV, Super Bowl XXXII, Super Bowl XXXIII and Super Bowl XXXVII).\n\n[2] Super Bowl: Following several seasons with poor records in the 1980s, the Dallas Cowboys rose back to prominence in the 1990s. During this decade, the Cowboys made post-season appearances every year except for the seasons of 1990 and 1997. From 1992 to 1996, the Cowboys won their division championship each year. In this same period, the Buffalo Bills had made their mark reaching the Super Bowl for a record four consecutive years, only to lose all four. After Super Bowl championships by division rivals New York (1990) and Washington (1991), the Cowboys won three of the next four Super Bowls (XXVII, XXVIII, and XXX) led by quarterback Troy Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith, and wide receiver Michael Irvin. All three of these players went to the Hall of Fame. The Cowboys' streak was interrupted by the 49ers, who won their league-leading fifth title overall with Super Bowl XXIX in dominating fashion under Super Bowl MVP and Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young, Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, and Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders; however, the Cowboys' victory in Super Bowl XXX the next year also gave them five titles overall and they did so with Sanders after he won the Super Bowl the previous year with the 49ers. The NFC's winning streak was continued by the Green Bay Packers who, under Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, won Super Bowl XXXI, their first championship since Super Bowl II\n\n[3] Green Bay Packers: The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre–Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers won the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and 1968 and were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) prior to the AFL–NFL merger. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is named after the Packers' coach of the same name, who guided them to their first two Super Bowls. Their two subsequent Super Bowl wins came in 1996 and 2010.\n\n[4] Foxborough, Massachusetts: The football team has won the Hockomock League title and also won the Division 2 Super Bowl various times, most recently in 2007 with a 21–10 victory over Burlington. Coincidentally, the Super Bowl win also gave coach Jack Martinelli his 200th win. During the 1987 and 1988 seasons, the Warriors won back to back Division 3 Super Bowls and went undefeated in 1988. This team featured 5 players that went on to play Division 1 college football (Chris Cady, Eric Matckie, Tom Nalen, Dan Sullivan, Rob Turenne). The cheerleading team has also earned recognition, making it to nationals for the first time in 2004 and then again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.\n\n[5] History of the Green Bay Packers: By winning the 1967 NFL Championship Game, the Packers achieved a \"three-peat\" (three consecutive league championships) for only the second time in franchise history and the first time since they were named league champions following the 1929–31 seasons. To this day, no other NFL team has matched or surpassed this record. The Packers' back-to-back wins in the first two Super Bowls remains a Super Bowl record, and has since been tied seven times by six other franchises: the Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls VII and VIII following the 1972 and 1973 seasons, the Pittsburgh Steelers won Super Bowls IX and X following the 1974 and 1975 seasons as well as Super Bowls XIII and XIV following the 1978 and 1979 seasons and remain, to date, the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowl titles more than once, the San Francisco 49ers won Super Bowls XXIII and XXIV following the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII following the 1992 and 1993 seasons, the Denver Broncos won Super Bowls XXXII and XXXIII following the 1997 and 1998 seasons, and most recently, the New England Patriots won Super Bowls XXXVIII and XXXIX following the 2003 and 2004 seasons.\n\n[6] History of the Green Bay Packers: The Packers played the Pittsburgh Steelers, who were seeking a record seventh Super Bowl title, in Super Bowl XLV at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The Packers struck first with two touchdowns near the end of the first quarter, one on a Jordy Nelson touchdown catch and the other on a Nick Collins interception return. Collins' touchdown marked the third consecutive playoff game in which the Packers returned an interception for a touchdown. The first half ended with the Packers leading 21–10, but they had lost both cornerback Charles Woodson and wide receiver Donald Driver to injury. The Steelers started to rally, but the Packers defense caused a key fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter and later stopped the Steelers on their final drive, winning their fourth Super Bowl and their record 13th overall NFL championship, 31–25. Aaron Rodgers was voted the game's MVP. With the win, the Packers joined the Steelers, 49ers and Cowboys as the only NFL teams to win at least four Super Bowls. They would eventually be joined by the New York Giants, who won their fourth Super Bowl (Super Bowl XLVI) following the 2011 season, and the New England Patriots, who won their fourth Super Bowl (Super Bowl XLIX) following the 2014 season.\n\n[7] Super Bowl X: Super Bowl X was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Dallas Cowboys and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Pittsburgh Steelers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1975 season. The Steelers defeated the Cowboys by the score of 21–17 to win their second consecutive Super Bowl. They were the third team to win back-to-back Super Bowls. (The Miami Dolphins won Super Bowls VII and VIII, and the Green Bay Packers won Super Bowls I and II.) It was also the first Super Bowl in which both participating teams had previously won a Super Bowl, as the Steelers were the defending champions and the Cowboys had won Super Bowl VI.\n\n[8] 1988 Chicago Bears season: The 1988 Chicago Bears season was their 69th regular season and 19th postseason completed in the National Football League. The Bears looked to improve on an 11–4 finish that won them the NFC Central Division but where they were eliminated for the second consecutive year by the Washington Redskins. The Bears won 12 games and lost 4, tying for the best record in the league with the Buffalo Bills and the AFC Champion Cincinnati Bengals, and earned home field advantage in the NFC. However, the Bears failed to advance to the Super Bowl as one of the top two seeds for a third straight season, falling to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game at Soldier Field. This was the second time that the 49ers and Bears had met for a trip to the Super Bowl during the decade, with the 49ers defeating the Bears on their way to Super Bowl XIX.\n\n[9] 1982 Sugar Bowl: Twenty-two Pittsburgh Panthers were drafted over the next four years by the National Football League. Six of them were selected in the first round, including Marino, Jim Covert, Tim Lewis, Bill Maas, Chris Doleman, and Bill Fralic. Marino and Doleman were elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Covert is the only player on the winning team to win a Super Bowl, four years later with the Chicago Bears. Coincidentally, the Louisiana Superdome was also the site of Super Bowl XX, where Covert and the Bears won.\n\n[10] Super Bowl: The 1980s also produced the 1985 Chicago Bears, who posted an 18–1 record under head coach Mike Ditka; quarterback Jim McMahon; and Hall of Fame running back Walter Payton. Their team won Super Bowl XX in dominant fashion. The Washington Redskins and New York Giants were also top teams of this period; the Redskins won Super Bowls XVII, XXII, and XXVI. The Giants claimed Super Bowls XXI and XXV. As in the 1970s, the Oakland Raiders were the only team to interrupt the Super Bowl dominance of other teams; they won Super Bowls XV and XVIII (the latter as the Los Angeles Raiders).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nWho won the 1988 Super Bowl?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

In many European and non-European countries the first national and regional structures have been established. From the 19–20 April 2008 representatives from numerous local and regional groups from Germany met in Erfurt to discuss establishing a national initiative with the purpose of a new governance structure of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative. As a result, an Erfurt Declaration was accepted, which expresses the will to establish an umbrella organisation to house the local, regional and national groups. As to not contract initiative’s own understanding of its network-like character and open design, the establishment of a national organisation has recently been abandoned. People can belong to numerous organisations, get involved in local groups informally or organize a club. There should not be a national organisation or governing body.\n\n[2] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: The Global Marshall Plan Initiative addresses this with their ideas and suggestions aimed at different audiences:Shortly after establishing the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, Karolin and Frithjof Finkbeiner founded the Global Marshall Plan Foundation. From them on, the foundation took over from the duties originally assigned to the Global Contract Foundation of an international coordination office of the initiative. Since the foundation has acted as secretariat for the initiative, taking care of the proper application of logos, networking actors and promoting many innovative projects with the help of numerous supporters. Alongside the support of the children’s initiative Plant-for-the-Planet, which is active in more than 193 countries, it is possible to organize more international conferences, as for example the Commons Forum, and train around 40 participants through the multiplier training of the Global Marshall Plan Academy that take places yearly.\n\n[3] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: As the world increasingly finds itself in a difficult, unsustainable situation as a result of rapid globalization, both in terms of environmental issues, poverty and unequal distribution, as well as the disproportionate cultural balance, on 16 May 2003 representatives from 16 civil society organizations revived the original idea for a global Marshall Plan as a movement for world peace, sustainability and justice, and at the Frankfurt airport, the Global Marshall Plan initiative was launched. Since the initiative should be organized as a network, i.e. locally and without hierarchies, the coordination of tasks and activities was assigned to different people and institutions: the coordination of content was taken up by Prof. Dr. Franz-Josef Radermacher as Head of FAW/n, politicians, and Josef Riegler, with particular importance on an EU level and the Eco-Social Forum Europe. The coordination, initiation and promotion of supporters’ activities internationally were assigned the Global Contract Foundation and Frithjof Finkbeiner. Due to the enormous positive response and the wide range of activities, this commission was soon transferred to the Global Marshall Plan Foundation.\n\n[4] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: The long-term goal of the initiative is to establish a global eco-social market economy and alter the current failing global framework to lead to long-lasting peace and sustainability. From the beginning, the founders set themselves the goal of developing the initiative as openly as possible and also of winning over the support of the economy. All actors and parts of the global society should find that in the Global Marshall Plan one-sided organization can constructively be prevented. The initiative aims to provide the greatest possible support to the world to ensure that the plan is continually developed in its substance, quality, implementation and coverage.\n\n[5] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: Some of the more than 200 organizations that support the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, set up a coordination circle for the initiative in December 2010 in Munich and took over the political and content related duties that had until then been shared out between others. The coordination circle develops strategic and content positions of the Global Marshall Plan Initiative, decides which projects to support, works on further development of content and is responsible for the yearly initiative meeting. Since November 2011 members have busied themselves with the development of a list of demands for the financial crisis. The current paper can be downloaded from the initiative’s website.\n\n[6] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was not new but had already been endorsed in the 1990s by personalities from a variety of sectors: Kofi Annan, Al Gore, Hans Küng, Susan George, Mikhail Gorbachov, His Royal Highness Prince El Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, George Soros, Lutz Wicke, Georg Winter and many others (Global Contract). As early as the beginning of the 1990s an ecological Marshall Plan was established by prominent personalities such as journalist Franz Alt and German Green politician Joscka Fisher. Along with many other supporters, they called for the establishment of an eco-social market economy, 100 billion DM put towards the environment every year and a Kerosin tax.\n\n[7] Global Marshall Plan: In order to further the idea of a GMP and to coordinate the various initiatives, NGOs, scientists, activists and groups in the field of development cooperation and global social justice the Global Marshall Plan Initiative was founded by members of the Club of Rome, the Club of Budapest, the Eco-Social Forum Europe, ATTAC and other organisations in Frankfurt, Germany in 2003. The two main objectives are to find new ways and sources of financing in development cooperation, predominantly pursuing the Millennium Development Goals of the UN and the worldwide propagation of the eco-social market economy, which is considered to be one of today's key strategies of initiative. The *Green Marshall Plan* is a policy initiative developed by Canadian greens Constantine Kritsonis and Craig Hubley. It offers a basis for global central banks to *bail out the planet* by creating new money to pay for green infrastructure. Here below it is presented as a policy proposal for the Green Party of Canada. A) The right to create money belongs to the citizens, but has been \"contracted out\" to irresponsible entities that have participated in creating a vast ecological debt.\n\n[8] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: In a series of lectures in 2003-4, the initiative was refined further. Eventually the first report on the Global Marshall Plan Initiative (“Global Marshall Plan – A Planetary Contract for a global Eco-Social Market Economy) was compiled. It was published in September 2004.\n\n[9] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: In January 2007 the state parliament of Thuringia became the first national parliament in Germany to commit the goals of the Global Marshall Plan. The parliament paper (Parliament paper 4/2658) also requested the Thuringia state government to support the development of a concrete package of measures for the implementation of the Global Marshall Plan and to raise awareness with prominent example projects and information events in Thuringia as well reporting on progress every three years in state parliament. Since November 2007 the city of Munich has also supported the Global Marshall Plan.\n\n[10] Global Marshall Plan Initiative: The idea of a Global Marshall Plan was first published in 1990 by U.S. politician, entrepreneur and environmentalist Al Gore in his book “Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit”. The choice of name deliberately recalls the historical Marshall Plan after the Second World War (officially: European Recovery Program), a symbol for hope, solidarity and peace.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the provided contexts:\n\nWhen was The Global Marshall Plan Initiative formed?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Meath. 1963 saw the first national championship to be televised from the Grove Pool in Belfast. The 1960s were a period of innovation in Irish swimming with the introduction of national squad training, development of centralised programme for teachers and coaches, and an increase in the number of indoor pools. International results also began to improve with the country's first individual winners in internationals, victories at the ASA Championships, and re-entering the Olympics.\n\n[2] History of sport: Sports that are at least two and a half thousand years old include hurling in Ancient Ireland, shinty in Scotland, harpastum (similar to rugby) in Rome, cuju (similar to association football) in China, and polo in Persia. The Mesoamerican ballgame originated over three thousand years ago. The Mayan ballgame of Pitz is believed to be the first ball sport, as it was first played around 2500 BCE.There are artifacts and structures that suggest that the Chinese engaged in sporting activities as early as 2000 BCE. Gymnastics appears to have been a popular sport in China's ancient past. Ancient Persian sports include the traditional Iranian martial art of Zourkhaneh. Among other sports that originated in Persia are polo and jousting. A polished bone implement found at Eva in Tennessee, United States and dated to around 5000 BCE has been construed as a possible sporting device used in a \"ring and pin\" game.\n\n[3] Softball: In 1895 Lewis Rober, Sr. of Minneapolis organized outdoor games as exercise for firefighters; this game was known as kitten ball (after the first team to play it), lemon ball, or diamond ball. Rober's version of the game used a ball in circumference, rather than the ball used by the Farragut club, and eventually the Minneapolis ball prevailed, although the dimensions of the Minneapolis diamond were passed over in favor of the dimensions of the Chicago one. Rober may not have been familiar with the Farragut Club rules. Fire Station No. 19 in Minneapolis, Rober's post from 1896 to 1906, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its association with the sport's development. The first softball league outside the United States was organized in Toronto in 1897.\n\n[4] Brendan Moon: However in \"Running Rugby\" (1995), following many of David Campese’s accomplishments, Ella wrote of Campese that, “I do not know of anyone in any sport, with the single exception of Don Bradman in cricket, who has been at the very pinnacle of the game for as long as Campese. If I had been asked to pick a World XV in 1984, Campese would have been the first player I chose. If I were asked to do the same thing today, in 1995, he is still the first player I would choose.” In light of this statement Ella likely rated Campese ahead of Moon by that stage. In \"Running Rugby\" (1995) Ella was also more conservative in rating Moon. Rather than saying who he felt was a better player, Ella stated that: “Two of the three best wingers I have seen in international rugby were Australians – David Campese and Brendan Moon [the third being John Kirwan].”\n\n[5] Sport in Kenya: Most modern sports in Kenya owe credit to the British colonisation. Professional teams in form of clubs were organised by colonial British settlers and Asian contractors as early as 1922, before the establishment of formal schools. Sports were introduced in schools in 1925. The syllabus for teaching sport through physical training in schools (extracurricular activity) was produced in 1935. Football and athletics (track and field) respectively were the first sports to be professionally organized.\n\n[6] Ball hockey: The first documented instance of a sport similar to ball hockey, in which a stick is used to propel a ball into a net for points, was an Irish game called hurling from the second millennium BC. In North America, Natives were first observed playing a variant of the game in 1572. In the 1960s Canada became the first nation to play the sport in organized leagues, followed by the United States the next decade, then countries in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n[7] List of Sailor Moon characters: is the ultimate future form of Sailor Moon. She comes from a future which has been destroyed by the battle with Sailor Chaos; after ages of fighting, she despairs and flees to the past as the infant Chibichibi, to encourage Eternal Sailor Moon to defeat Chaos in the final battle of the series. At first, she wants Sailor Moon to destroy the Galaxy Cauldron altogether, ensuring Chaos' destruction, but Sailor Moon protests, realizing that if the Cauldron is destroyed no more stars will be born, leaving the Galaxy without a future. She chooses to sacrifice herself to the Cauldron and seal Chaos away, which Cosmos finally realizes to have been the right decision. Reminded of the strength and courage she herself needs to have, she returns to the future with new hope. After the end of the anime adaptation, Takeuchi commented that she wished Sailor Cosmos had been used in \"Sailor Moon Sailor Stars\". In the musicals, Sailor Cosmos is played by Satomi Okubo, who played Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon between 2013 and 2015.\n\n[8] Baseball at the 1956 Summer Olympics: Baseball was again a demonstration sport at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Though it was nominally the \"foreign\" demonstration sport of that Olympiad, Australia had a long history of baseball dating back to at least 1889. The Australians were the first to field a full team in an exhibition match against the United States, represented by a detachment from the United States Far East Command. Many Sheffield Shield cricket players – who were quite successful at baseball as a winter sport – were unable to be selected on the basis that they were professional players.\n\n[9] Jumpers (play): Jumpers is a play by Tom Stoppard which was first performed in 1972. It explores and satirises the field of academic philosophy, likening it to a less-than skilful competitive gymnastics display. \"Jumpers\" raises questions such as \"What do we know?\" and \"Where do values come from?\" It is set in an alternative reality where some British astronauts have landed on the moon and \"Radical Liberals\" (read pragmatists and relativists) have taken over the British government (the play seems to suggest that pragmatists and relativists would be immoral: Archie says that murder is not wrong, merely \"antisocial\"). It was inspired by the notion that a manned moon landing would ruin the moon as a poetic trope and possibly lead to a collapse of moral values.\n\n[10] Track and field: The sport of track and field has its roots in human prehistory. Track and field-style events are among the oldest of all sporting competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized track and field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards track and field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the answer to the question.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It samples an instrumental by GottiOnEm and Mazza, which was first used on 86's \"Lurk\" and later on \"Let's Lurk\" by 67 featuring Giggs. The song saw commercial success, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom. The song has been certified platinum in the UK by the BPI, indicating 600,000 combined sales and streams. The music video has also gained over 300 million views on YouTube.\n\n[2] Always the Sun: \"Always the Sun\" is a song by English rock band The Stranglers, first released as a single on 6 October 1986, the second single from the album \"Dreamtime\". A remixed version was released as a single on 24 December 1990. Both versions were top thirty hits in the United Kingdom. \"Always the Sun\" was released in October 1986 in four different formats: a seven-inch single, shaped seven inch picture disc, twelve inch single, and as a double seven inch single pack.\n\n[3] Unorthodox Jukebox: The song \"When I Was Your Man\" is a pop piano ballad and shows traditional notions of romance, a pre-fame heartbreak as Mars regrets letting his woman get away. Melinda Newman of \"HitFix\" thought the track \"sounds like a cross between Stevie Wonder and Elton John,\" also seeing \"a touch of Michael Jackson\" in his delivery. Andy Gill of \"The Independent\" called it a \"McCartney-esque piano ballad\", while Jason Lipshut of \"Billboard\" wrote that \"it will make for a killer lighters-in-the-air moment in concert. Although it's not quite an Alicia Keys-esque powerhouse, [it] smartly allows Mars to momentarily remove his fedora and bare his soul\". The single was additionally likened to the material of Wham!. With \"Natalie\", Mars exhibits further male chauvinist sentiments over a girl named Natalie which stole Mars' money and ran away with it; the singer is therefore plotting murderous revenge against her. The song was described as \"a sort of methed-up \"Dirty Diana\", assembled with fierce handclaps and hard-edged oooh-oooh vocal echos\". Lipshutz called it the \"flip-side of \"When I Was Your Man\" and pointed out Mars lamenting the hypnotism of a \"gold-digging bitch\". \"Show Me\" portrays a recording with ample influences of reggae and dancehall. These infusion\n\n[4] Them Again: Two of the original Van Morrison songs included on the album, \"My Lonely Sad Eyes\" and \"Hey Girl\", can be seen as precursors to the poetic musings of Morrison's later \"Astral Weeks\" album, released in 1968. \"My Lonely Sad Eyes\" begins with the words, \"Fill me my cup, and I'll drink your sparkling wine/Pretend that everything is fine, 'til I see your sad eyes.\" The title implies that the sad eyes belong to the singer but the lyrics address the singer's love interest. The song \"Hey Girl\" has a pastoral feel to it, enhanced by the addition of flutes and in Brian Hinton's opinion is a \"dry run for 'Cyprus Avenue'\" from \"Astral Weeks\". The cover version of Bob Dylan's \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", is considered by author Clinton Heylin to be \"that genuine rarity, a Dylan cover to match the original.\" Among the Van Morrison originals and cover versions found on the album, three of producer Tommy Scott's original compositions are also included.\n\n[5] Laid Back: Guldberg and Stahl met in the mid-1970s, and played together in a group called The Starbox Band. After a poorly received show supporting The Kinks, the band split up, but the duo continued working together. Guldberg set up a small studio in downtown Copenhagen where the two musicians began exploring the possibilities that were being opened up by new technologies, such as multitrack tape recorders, synthesizers and drum machines. Their debut album, simply titled \"Laid Back\", was released in 1981, and the single \"Maybe I'm Crazy\" became a number-one hit in Denmark. The next year, the single \"Sunshine Reggae\" was released, and became another chart-topper in their home country; it was later included on the band's second album, \"Keep Smiling\", in 1983, and went on to become a number-one single in Italy, West Germany, and nineteen other countries around the world. In the US, however, it was the single's B-side that became the band's only big hit. \"White Horse\" is a funk-influenced dance track with a memorable bassline and ambiguous, drug- and/or sex-themed lyrics (\"white horse\" being a slang for heroin) that became popular in US clubs. After the song was re-released as an A-side on both 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl, it went on to spend three weeks at number one on \"Billboard\"s National Disco Action charts; it was also a crossover success, reaching the\n\n[6] Irresistible (Jessica Simpson album): \"When You Told Me You Loved Me\" is another power ballad about love, this time utilizing a spanish guitar. Backed by a full 60 piece orchestra, the song and Simpson's vocals were compared to that of Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. \"Hot Like Fire\", which received positive reviews from critics, is a funky mid-tempo number. Compared to the likes of Michael Jackson and Destiny's Child, the song begins with a \"faux\" telephone call between Simpson and her friend; the latter explains that Simpson's boyfriend has been cheating on her. The lyrics, sung with \"hard edge vocals\" over synth horns, hip-hop beats, and electronica rhythms, demonstrate Simpson's annoyance at being cheated on by her boyfriend. \"Imagination\" is a song with electronic and R&B influences. Rick de Yampert of \"The Daytona Beach News-Journal\" commented that the song contained Stevie Wonder-styled funk music. \"To Fall in Love Again\" and \"For Your Love\" are ballads; the former is backed by a 60 piece orchestra, and Peter Marsh of BBC Music noted it \"morphs [...] into an R'n'B tinged slow jam.\" It also contains a jazz breakdown, towards its end. Bob Waliszewski wrote that through the latter, \"Simpson pledges devotion to a partner\". \"I Never\", produced by Darkchild, infuses Spanish guitars, and has an \"urban\" ting\n\n[7] Blue Moon (1934 song): Hart wrote new lyrics for the tune to create a title song for the 1934 film \"Manhattan Melodrama\": \"Act One:/You gulp your coffee and run;/Into the subway you crowd./Don't breathe, it isn't allowed\". The song, which was also titled \"It's Just That Kind of Play\", was cut from the film before release, and registered for copyright as an unpublished work on March 30, 1934. The studio then asked for a nightclub number for the film. Rodgers still liked the melody so Hart wrote a third lyric: \"The Bad in Every Man\" (\"Oh, Lord ... /I could be good to a lover,/But then I always discover/The bad in ev'ry man\"), which was sung by Shirley Ross. The song, which was also released as sheet music, was not a hit.\n\n[8] All the Man That I Need: Released in December 1990, \"All the Man That I Need\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles chart at number 53, the issue dated December 22, 1990. Ten weeks later, on the issue dated February 23, 1991, it ascended to the top of the chart, becoming Houston's ninth number-one on the chart. It stayed atop the chart for two weeks and remained on the chart for a total of 23 weeks. It also topped the Hot 100 Singles Sales and Hot 100 Airplay charts, her first song to achieve this feat since \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" in 1988. The single entered the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (formerly Hot R&B Singles) at number 58, the same week it debuted on the Hot 100. It later peaked at number one on the chart, the issue date of March 2, 1991, making it Houston's fifth R&B number-one hit. When it hit the pole position of the R&B chart, the single enjoyed its second and third week at the top of the Hot 100 and Hot Adult Contemporary charts, respectively. As a result, it became her first single topped simultaneously all of three different \"Billboard\" charts — the Hot 100, Hot R&B, and Hot Adult Contemporary — and overall the third triple-crown hit, after 1985's \"Saving All My Love for You\" and 1986's \"How Will I Know,\" reached the top spot on those of three charts in separate weeks. The song maintained the top position of the Adult\n\n[9] Mongolian cosmogony: At the origin of the world, there was only one man and vast particularly dry meadows, burned by the seven suns which lit the world. This man, a very good archer, made the promise to the gods that he pierced all these suns without missing a target even once. If he should fail, he would cut himself all the fingers one by one and leave to live in a hole like a marmot (ground-hog) to ward off the curse that would weigh on him. He took his bow, pulled a first arrow and hit his target. A second, a third until the sixth which destroyed the suns. He finished by pulling his seventh arrow towards the last sun, when a swallow flew off and passed through its direction. The bird was hit. The man had not reach his goal, so he left towards exile in a hole, cut his fingers and turned into a marmot. The swallow had just saved our Sun, otherwise all life would have disappeared from the world's surface.\n\n[10] Hey, Man!: \"Hey, Man!\" is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado, produced by Gerald Eaton and Brian West for Furtado's debut album, \"Whoa, Nelly!\". The song was released as the album's fourth (and final) single in some European countries, but it charted only in Germany, where it reached number forty-nine, Netherlands, where it reached number eighty-seven, and Romania, where it reached number sixty-five. \"Hey, Man!\" samples \"White Man Sleeps\" from the Kronos Quartet's album \"Pieces of Africa\". Furtado described the song as: \"a big pop song and kind of rocking now because we went back to the demo version of it. Brian West had his 'Pieces of Africa' disc, and he wanted something distinct to happen in the chorus. So he chopped up 'White Man Sleeps' by The Kronos Quartet.\"\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\":\n\nIs the phrase \"Man, it's a hot one, like seven inches from the midday sun\" present in", "llama-2-7b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.

Other polyphonic synthesizers followed, mainly manufactured in Japan and the United States from the mid-1970s to the early-1980s, and included Roland Corporation's RS-101 and RS-202 (1975 and 1976) string synthesizers, the Yamaha CS-80 (1976), Oberheim's Polyphonic and OB-X (1975 and 1979), Sequential Circuits' Prophet-5 (1978), and Roland's Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8 (1978 and 1981). The success of the Prophet-5, a polyphonic and microprocessor-controlled keyboard synthesizer, aided the shift of synthesizers away from large modular units and towards smaller keyboard instruments. This helped accelerate the integration of synthesizers into popular music, a shift that had been lent powerful momentum by the Minimoog and later the ARP Odyssey. Earlier polyphonic electronic instruments of the 1970s, rooted in string synthesizers before advancing to multi-synthesizers incorporating monosynths and more, gradually fell out of favour in the wake of these newer, note-assigned polyphonic keyboard synthesizers.\n\n[3] History of home keyboards: The exploration of musical synthesizers in the 1960s was a step towards the modern keyboard. As technology became more developed, huge synthesizers evolved into portable instruments that could be used in live shows. The rapid accumulation of momentum began in 1964 when Bob Moog produced his Moog synthesizer. It used a remote keyboard and was 'modular' in design. (i.e. it was a rack that held boxes which each had a function. At least one to create a tone controlled in pitch by a voltage input. And usually a host of other modules including Filter(s), Amplifier(s), Envelope Generator(s) etc. ) His next generation was equipped with a built-in keyboard in 1970; the Mini-Moog. These keyboards were monophonic, along with semi-modulars like the ARP2600, and were only able to respond to one note at a time. (Though 3 oscillators could be layered together in response to the 'control voltage' produced by that note.)\n\n[4] Keyboardist: The use of electronic keyboards grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, with many bands using the Hammond organ, Mellotron, and electric pianos such as the Fender Rhodes. The Doors became the first group to use the Moog synthesizer on a pop record on 1967's \"Strange Days\". Other bands, including The Moody Blues, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles would go on to add it to their records, both to provide sound effects and as a musical instrument in its own right. In 1966, Billy Ritchie became the first keyboard player to take a lead role in a rock band, replacing guitar, and thereby preparing the ground for others such as Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman. In the late 1960s, a pioneer of modern electronic music Jean Michel Jarre started to experiment with synthesizers and other electronic devices. As synthesizers became more affordable and less unwieldy, many more bands and producers began using them, eventually paving the way for bands that consisted solely of synthesizers and other electronic instruments such as drum machines by the late 1970s/early 1980s. Some of the first bands that used this set up were Kraftwerk, Suicide and The Human League. Rock groups also began using synthesizers and electronic keyboards alongside the traditional line-up of guitar, bass and drums; particularly in progressive rock groups such as Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Pink Floyd. The pop-blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac was also known for synthesize\n\n[5] History of home keyboards: In 1977, the Yamaha CS-60 and CS-80 polyphonic synthesizers began to implement synthesizer 'memory'. However it was merely an alternate set of sliders that hid under a hatch. In 1978, however the OB-1 from Oberheim gave actual electronic storage of the sound settings. The Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 the same year offered this feature in a five voice polyphonic synthesizer. Dave Smith's company developed some other firsts. But the ARP engineers were acquired by Fender when they bought the mismanaged company in 1979. And they completed the Fender Rhodes Chroma, the first computer controlled keyboard. Released in 1981, an Apple computer could be used to run sequencing software that allowed the user to easily program which notes were being hit at particular instants in the song production. The 'Chroma' port only appeared on the successor though, the Chroma Polaris in 1984.\n\n[6] Music technology: The invention of the miniature transistor in 1947 enabled the creation of a new generation of synthesizers, which were used first in pop music in the 1960s. Unlike prior keyboard instrument technologies, synthesizer keyboards do not have strings, pipes, or metal tines. A synthesizer keyboard creates musical sounds using electronic circuitry, or, later, computer chips and software. Synthesizers became popular in the mass market in the early 1980s. With the development of powerful microchips, a number of new electronic or digital music technologies were introduced in the 1980s and subsequent decades, including drum machines and music sequencers. Electronic and digital music technologies are any device, such as a computer, an electronic effects unit or software, that is used by a musician or composer to help make or perform music. The term usually refers to the use of electronic devices, computer hardware and computer software that is used in the performance, playback, recording, composition, sound recording and reproduction, mixing, analysis and editing of music.\n\n[7] History of home keyboards: In 1975, the turn towards building a synthesizer of sorts over an organ came to fruition in Moog’s Polymoog. Many patents exist from this keyboard. It incorporated velocity sensitivity for one thing. Each note had its own circuit board with a VCF/VCA chip so that it was truly fully polyphonic. Many were disappointed that the filter lacked the facilities of the more flexible moog filter used in other keyboards. And that there were so many connectors and they were not all that reliable. Also in 1975 Crumar of Italy produced the \"Multiman\" which also was an organ with synthesizer facilities. It had a bass option, a brass with filter controls and simple envelope, a piano and clavi preset, and a couple string tabs with decay control and vibrato control. The first of what we might call the 'Swiss army knife' synthesizer. In 1976 the ARP Omni combined a more limited synthesizer with a string machine and bass also and became ARP's biggest seller. Also in 1976 the Korg PE-1000 used an individual saw oscillator for each note.\n\n[8] Characteristics of progressive rock: The birth of progressive rock roughly coincided with the commercial availability of synthesizers. Early modular synthesizers were large instruments that used patch cords to route the signal flow. Programming the instruments meant placing the patch cords to connect the individual modules. The Minimoog, a smaller, simplified synthesizer that needed no patch cords, began production in 1971 and provided keyboardists with a more-easily programmed instrument that could imitate other instruments, could create new sounds of its own, and was highly portable and affordable. Progressive rock was the genre in which the synthesizer first became established as a common part of popular music. Synthesizers could be used to play the rapid, virtuosic lines that changed the perception of keyboard instruments. The reliance on the use of multiple keyboard sounds meant that some keyboardists appeared onstage surrounded by ten or more keyboards. Modern digital synthesizers and samplers have reduced the need for huge keyboard stacks, as they typically allow sounds to be layered or for one keyboard to trigger another's sounds through a MIDI connection. They also provide a reliable alternative to instruments such as Mellotrons, whose delicate mechanical apparatus is prone to breakdowns, and are much more portable than bulky instruments such as the Hammond organ. Digital synthesizers are also suitable chordal instruments, unlike early analog synthesizers such as the Minimoog, Moog Taurus and ARP \n\n[9] History of home keyboards: Dave Smith's company found interest in a cooperative effort with Roland. In 1983, the invention of the musical instrumental digital interface (MIDI) as a standard for digital code transmission digital technology development spurred on more great development in keyboard technology. As now keyboards from totally different manufacturers could communicate through an inexpensive cable, jack and system of codes. The Sequential Circuits Prophet 600 and the Roland Jupiter 6 communicated via MIDI at the NAMM trade show and Yamaha soon had the standard implemented into their DX synthesizers which would outsell all previous keyboards.\n\n[10] Tom Oberheim: Oberheim first showed the SEM, which was the first synthesizer bearing his company's name, at the Audio Engineering Society convention in Los Angeles in May 1974. The following year, when Norlin (CMI's successor) cancelled several large orders for Oberheim's Maestro products, Oberheim shifted his design and manufacturing efforts to replace that lost business. He expanded the SEM concept, and again enlisting the expertise of Dave Rossum and Scott Wedge of E-mu Systems, combining the SEM with a digital keyboard, created the Oberheim 2-Voice and 4-Voice synthesizers, the first commercially available polyphonic music synthesizers. By combining more single-voice synthesizer modules together, Oberheim expanded the concept to the Oberheim 8-Voice synthesizer, introduced in 1976. Realizing that programming the 4-Voice on stage was impractical, he designed the Polyphonic Synthesizer Programmer, an integrated circuit memory for storing the synthesizer's sound settings, another industry first. Integrating this technology into a synthesizer, Oberheim introduced the OB1, the first programmable monophonic synthesizer, in 1977. By 1980, Oberheim's products, by then including synthesizers, a polyphonic digital sequencer (the DSX), and a sampled-sound drum machine (the DMX) were designed to be combined to form a complete system, and could be interconnected by a proprietary Oberheim parallel bus interface that pre-dated MIDI. With the company now gathering pace, from the turn of the 1980s Oberheim\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhen was the synthesizer keyboard invented?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

In her work Palmer is referencing and questioning Peter III's wife Catherine the Great's memoirs. According to Palmer's research Catherine initiated Peter's murder and illegally succeeded his throne, while later characterizing him as an “idiot”, “drunkard of Holstein”, “good-for-nothing” in order to improve her own bad reputation among the people of Russia. Elena Palmer says: \"Peter III was neither a drunkard nor a moron. His plans for the dramatic transformation of society reveal a young Emperor's vision that was far ahead of his contemporaries. Peter took a position of “enlightened absolutism”, which was very new and progressive for this period in Russian history. With his democratic approaches, Peter was in a position to lead Russia out of the impasse of feudalism and was able to create a new social order without bloodshed. He proved his fortitude with ambitious reforms and gave the country hope for economic and social advancements. There were no political reasons for Peter’s overthrow, as the people loved their Emperor and his supporters idolized him. Rather, the fate of Peter III was a family tragedy the likes of a Shakespeare drama. The queen’s lover killed her husband\n\n[2] Peter III of Russia: Peter has been depicted on screen a number of times, almost always in films concerning his wife Catherine. He was portrayed by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in the 1934 film \"The Rise of Catherine the Great\" and by Sam Jaffe in \"The Scarlet Empress\" the same year. In 1991 Reece Dinsdale portrayed him in the television series \"Young Catherine\". \"La Tempesta\" (1958) depicts Yemelyan Pugachev's effort to force his recognition as Peter III and offers a critical view of Catherine the Great, with Van Heflin in the role of Pugachev and Viveca Lindfors as Catherine. He was also depicted as a cowardly, drunken wife-beater in the Japanese anime \"Le Chevalier D'Eon\". He also appears in the 2014 TV series played by Aleksander Yatsenko.\n\n[3] Catherine the Great: At least sixteen pretenders during Catherine's reign claimed that they were the deposed tsar, Peter III. A less common position pretenders claimed during Catherine's reign was that of Ivan VI. Ivan VI was a potential threat to Catherine since he was exiled as an infant and could lay claim to the throne. Peter III was the more popular option for pretenders since there existed legends that he was not actually dead, allowing pretenders to convince discontented Russians they were Peter III. Peter III was also popular among Russians because of his benevolent rule. Pretenders claiming to be Peter III used his popularity among Russians to gain support. Pretenders had to be careful to establish themselves as the ruler they claimed to be without being recognised as a normal mortal and not of royal blood. One popular way to prevent recognition was to claim their right to royalty far from their home as both Emal'Ian Ivanovich Pugachev and the pretender Artem'ev did. Pretenders also had to account for where they had disappeared to for the time since their reported deaths. For example, Pugachev claimed that he spent the eleven years since Peter III's reported death wandering abroad as far as Egypt or Constantinople.\n\n[4] Catherine the Great (1995 film): A young German Princess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) gets married to the immature future Czar Peter III (Hannes Jaenicke). She gradually becomes a skillful politician and rises to become Catherine the Great.\n\n[5] Peter the Great: He took Martha Skavronskaya, a Polish-Lithuanian peasant, as a mistress some time between 1702 and 1704. Martha converted to the Russian Orthodox Church and took the name Catherine. Though no record exists, Catherine and Peter are described as having married secretly between 23 Oct and 1 Dec 1707 in St. Petersburg. Peter valued Catherine and married her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg on .\n\n[6] Catherine Alekseyevna of Russia: Tsarevna Catherine Alekseyevna (; 27 November 1658 - 1 May 1718) was the fifth daughter of Tsar Alexis of Russia and Maria Miloslavskaya, sister of Tsar Feodor III of Russia and Tsar Ivan V of Russia and half-sister of Tsar Peter the Great. Catherine was named after Saint Catherine of Alexandria. In accordance with the Muscovite custom for imperial princesses, she lived in seclusion and never married. During the Moscow uprising of 1682, however, Ivan Andreyevich Khovansky (Tararui) is alleged to have planned to marry Catherine to his son Andrey Ivanovich Khovanskii in order to place him on the throne. Catherine Alekseyevna seems to have been supportive of Westernized reforms of Russia; while Russian princesses were expected to live in seclusion and screen completely from being seen by men, she was evidently seen in public in 1683, as a witness from that year reported how she did not wear the traditional clothes, but dressed in Polish costume and did not wear her hair in traditional braids.\n\n[7] Peter III of Russia: Peter III ( – ) (, \"Pyotr III Fyodorovich\") was Emperor of Russia for six months in 1762. He was born in Kiel as Karl Peter Ulrich von Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, the only child of Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp (the son of Hedvig Sophia of Sweden, sister of Charles XII), and Anna Petrovna (the elder surviving daughter of Peter the Great). The German Peter could hardly speak Russian and pursued a strongly pro-Prussian policy, which made him an unpopular leader. He was deposed and possibly assassinated as a result of a conspiracy led by his German wife, Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, who succeeded him to the throne as Catherine II. His death could also have been the result of a drunken brawl with his bodyguard when he was being held captive after Catherine's coup.\n\n[8] Military history of the Russian Empire: Peter III had a short and unpopular reign. Although he was a grandson of Peter the Great, his father was the duke of Holstein-Gottorp, so Peter III was raised in a German Lutheran environment. Russians therefore considered him a foreigner. Making no secret of his contempt for all things Russian, Peter created deep resentment by forcing Prussian military drills on the Russian military, attacking the Russian Orthodox Church, and depriving Russia of a military victory by establishing his sudden alliance with Prussia. Making use of the discontent and fearing for her own position, Peter III's wife, Catherine, deposed her husband in a coup, and her lover, Aleksey Orlov, subsequently murdered him, so in June 1762 Catherine became Catherine II, empress of Russia.\n\n[9] Russian Empire: Catherine the Great was a German princess who married Peter III, the German heir to the Russian crown. After the death of Empress Elizabeth, she came to power when her coup d'état against her unpopular husband succeeded. She contributed to the resurgence of the Russian nobility that began after the death of Peter the Great. State service was abolished, and Catherine delighted the nobles further by turning over most state functions in the provinces to them.\n\n[10] Peter III of Russia: Empress Elizabeth arranged for Peter to marry his second cousin, Sophia Augusta Frederica (later Catherine the Great), daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst and Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. The young princess formally converted to Russian Orthodoxy and took the name Ekaterina Alexeievna (i.e., Catherine). They married on 21 August 1745. The marriage was not a happy one but produced one son, the future Emperor Paul, and one daughter, Anna Petrovna (20 December 1757 – 19 March 1759). Catherine later claimed that Paul was not fathered by Peter: that, in fact, they had never consummated the marriage. During the sixteen years of their residence in Oranienbaum, Catherine took numerous lovers, while her husband did the same in the beginning.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the context in which the answer to your question can be found.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

None of those concentrations is higher than the level defined as \"HIGH\" by the UK Food Standards Agency (described for concentrations of sugar above 15 g per 100 g). As a comparison, Coca-Cola and orange juices are also in the range of 10 g of sugar per 100 g, but with a serving size usually higher than 250 ml the total sugar quantity is much higher.\n\n[2] Orange juice: Finishers have a screw-type design that comprises a conical helical screw enclosed in a cylindrical screen with perforations the size of 0.020 to 0.045 inches. Thereafter, the finished orange juice flows through blending tanks where the juice is tested for acid and soluble solids. At this stage, sugar can be added to the juice depending on if the product will be a sweetened or unsweetened beverage. Following blending, the orange juice is deaerated where the air is incorporated into the juice during extraction. The benefits of deaeration include the elimination of foaming, which improves the uniformity of can fill and improvement regarding the efficiency of the heat exchanger. Orange peel oil is essential for maximum flavor, but according to U.S. standards for Grades of Canned Orange Juice, 0.03% of recoverable oil is permitted. Deoiling through the use of vacuum distillation is the mechanism used to regulate the amount of peel oil in the juice. Condensation separates the oil and the aqueous distillate, which is returned to the juice.\n\n[3] Orange juice: The processing of orange to frozen concentrated orange juice begins with testing the orange fruit for quality to ensure it is safe for the process. Then the fruit is cleaned and washed thoroughly and orange oil is taken from the peel of the orange. Next, the juice is extracted from the orange and is screened in order to remove seeds and large pieces of pulp. The juice is then heated to 190 to 200 °F in order to inactivate natural enzymes found in the juice. The concentration step occurs in a high vacuum evaporator where the water content in the juice is evaporated while the juice sugar compounds and solids are concentrated. The vacuum evaporator is a low temperature falling-film mechanism, which operates at a temperature between 60 and 80 °F. Evaporators work in a continuous manner in that fresh juice is added as concentrate is being constantly removed. The concentration process increases the soluble solid portion of the juice from 12 °Brix to 60-70 °Brix.\n\n[4] Orange juice: In the United Kingdom, orange juice from concentrate is a product of concentrated fruit juice with the addition of water. Any lost flavour or pulp of the orange juice during the initial concentration process may be restored in the final product to be equivalent to an average type of orange juice of the same kind. Any restored flavour or pulp must come from the same species of orange. Sugar may be added to the orange juice for regulating the acidic taste or sweetening, but must not exceed 150g per litre of orange juice. Across the UK, the final orange juice from concentrate product must contain a minimum Brix level of 11.2, excluding the additional sweetening ingredients. Vitamins and minerals may be added to the orange juice in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1925/2006.\n\n[5] Orange juice: The health value of orange juice is debatable: it has a high concentration of vitamin C, but also a very high concentration of simple sugars, comparable to soft drinks. As a result, some government nutritional advice has been adjusted to encourage substitution of orange juice with raw fruit, which is digested more slowly, and limit daily consumption.\n\n[6] Orange juice: On a molecular level, orange juice is composed of organic acids, sugars, and phenolic compounds. The main organic acids found in orange juice are citric, malic, and ascorbic acid. The major sugars found in orange juice are sucrose, glucose, and fructose. There are approximately 13 phenolic compounds in orange juice including hydroxycinnamic acids, flavanones, hydroxybenzoic acids, hesperidin, narirutin, and ferulic acid.\n\n[7] Orange juice: There is a specific interaction between pectin and hesperidin through the sugar moieties in the hesperidin molecule. Through acid hydrolysis, the rhamnose and glucose sugar moieties are removed from hesperidin, which breaks the interaction between hesperidin and pectin. Hydrogen bonding plays a role in the specific interaction of neutral sugars of pectin and the sugar moiety of hesperidin. A polymer that has a high structural content of neutral sugar branches interacts with hesperidin more tightly and strongly than that of a low content of neutral sugar branches. The interaction between pectin and hesperidin is one of the factors that enable the colloidal suspension in orange juice to be stable.\n\n[8] Orange juice: For Canadian markets, orange juice must be the fruit juice obtained from clean, sound, and mature oranges. The juice must also contain a minimum of 1.20 milliequivalents of free amino acids per 100 millilitres, contain a minimum of 115 milligrams of potassium per 10 milliliters, and possess a minimum absorbance value for total polyphenolics of 0.380. Sweeteners such as sugar, invert sugar, dextrose or glucose solids may be added. The orange juice must have a Brix reading of at least 9.7, excluding the sweetening ingredients, and contain between 0.5 and 1.8 percent of acid by weight calculated as anhydrous citric acid. Added orange essences, orange oils and orange pulp adjusted in accordance with good manufacturing practice is permitted. Orange juice is also permitted to contain sugar, invert sugar, dextrose in dry form, glucose solids, a Class II preservative, amylase, cellulase and pectinase.\n\n[9] Orange juice: In the United States, orange juice is regulated and standardized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. According to the FDA, orange juice from concentrate is a mixture of water with frozen concentrated orange juice or concentrated orange juice for manufacturing. Additional ingredients into the mixture may include fresh/frozen/pasteurized orange juice from mature oranges, orange oil, and orange pulp. Furthermore, one or more of the following optional sweetening ingredients may be added: sugar, sugar syrup, invert sugar, invert sugar syrup, dextrose, corn syrup, dried corn syrup, glucose syrup, and dried glucose syrup. The orange juice must contain a minimum Brix level of 11.8, which indicates the percentage of orange juice soluble solids, excluding any added sweetening ingredients.\n\n[10] Marmalade: The first printed recipe for orange marmalade, though without the chunks typically used now, was in Mary Kettilby's 1714 cookery book, \"A Collection of above Three Hundred Receipts\" (pages 78–79). Kettilby called for whole oranges, lemon juice and sugar, with the acid in the lemon juice helping to create the pectin set of marmalade, by boiling the lemon and orange juice with the pulp. Kettilby then directs: \"boil the whole pretty fast 'till it will jelly\" – the first known use of the word \"jelly\" in marmalade making. Kettilby then instructs that the mixture is then poured into glasses, covered and left until set. As the acid would create a jelly, this meant that the mixture could be pulled from the heat before it had turned to a paste, keeping the marmalade much brighter and the appearance more translucent, as in modern-day marmalade.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nHow much sugar is in orange juice?\n\nNote: Please answer based on the information provided in the contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.\n\n1.

Construction of the hotel began in 1881 on a hill east of the downtown overlooking the town and the harbour. Had it been completed the hotel would have been a major landmark on the Oban skyline. The hotel was never completed due to financial difficulties and currently lies in ruins.\n\n[2] Oban, Saskatchewan: In 1925 Oban was located on the Minnedosa–Saskatoon–Edmonton CPR branch line between Castlewood, and Naseby. The CPR was intersected by the CNR GTP West. Oban was located on the CNR between Biggar and Palo. Oban was also a part of the Porter Subdivision, CNR between Lett and Biggar.\n\n[3] Oban distillery: The Oban Distillery is primarily known for its 14-year-old malt, which is marketed as part of Diageo's \"Classic Malts Selection\" range, launched in 1988. Also available is a \"Distiller's Edition\" bottling, which is finished in a Montilla Fino sherry cask before bottling. There is also an 18-year-old limited edition and a rare 32-year-old edition. In December 2014 Oban introduced a NAS (non-age-statement) bottling, called Oban \"Little Bay\".\n\n[4] Oban: The site where Oban now stands has been used by humans since at least mesolithic times, as evidenced by archaeological remains of cave dwellers found in the town. Just outside the town stands Dunollie Castle, on a site that overlooks the main entrance to the bay and has been fortified since the Bronze age. Prior to the 19th century, the town itself supported very few households, sustaining only minor fishing, trading, shipbuilding and quarrying industries, and a few hardy tourists. The Renfrew trading company established a storehouse there in about 1714 as a local outlet for its merchandise, but a Custom-house was not deemed necessary until 1736 when \"Oban being reckoned a proper place for clearing out vessels for the herring fishery\".\n\n[5] Oban: The modern town of Oban grew up around the distillery, which was founded there in 1794. The town was raised to a burgh of barony in 1811 by royal charter. Sir Walter Scott visited the area in 1814, the year in which he published his poem The Lord of the Isles; interest in the poem brought many new visitors to the town. The town was made a Parliamentary Burgh in 1833. A rail link - the Callander and Oban Railway - was authorised in 1864 but took years to reach the town. The final stretch of track to Oban opened on 30 June 1880. This brought further prosperity, revitalising local industry and giving new energy to tourism. Also at this time work on the ill-fated Oban Hydro was commenced but abandoned, and left to fall into disrepair, after 1882 when Dr Orr, the schemes originator, realised he had grossly underestimated its cost. Work on McCaig's Tower, a prominent local landmark, started in 1895. It was paid for by John Stewart McCaig (1824-1902) and was constructed, in hard times, to give work for local stone masons. However, its construction ceased in 1902 on the death of its benefactor. During World War II, Oban was used by Merchant and Royal Navy ships and was an important base in the Battle of the Atlantic. The Royal Navy had a signal station near Ganavan, and an anti-submarine indicator loop station, which detected any surface or submarine vessels between O\n\n[6] Oban: Oban lies at the western end of the A85 road. It also has a railway station from where a number of Abellio ScotRail trains run to and from Glasgow Queen Street daily. The town is also an important ferry port: it is Caledonian MacBrayne's busiest terminal. Oban is known as the \"Gateway to the Isles\", with ferries sailing to the islands of Lismore, Colonsay, Islay, Coll, Tiree, to Craignure on Mull, to Castlebay on Barra and to Lochboisdale on South Uist. In 2005, a new ferry terminal was opened, and in 2007 a second linkspan opened, allowing two vessels to load/unload at the same time.\n\n[7] Oban: Oban ( ; \"\" in Scottish Gaelic meaning \"The Little Bay\") is a resort town within the Argyll and Bute council area of Scotland. Despite its small size, it is the largest town between Helensburgh and Fort William. During the tourist season, the town can play host to up to 25,000 people. Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay is a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull. To the north, is the long low island of Lismore, and the mountains of Morvern and Ardgour.\n\n[8] Oban: Laurinburg, North Carolina (United States) became a sister city to Oban in 1993. The initial agreement was between Scotland County, North Carolina, and Argyll & Bute District Council. Following reorganisation in 1995, the agreement was confirmed by Argyll & Bute Council in 1997. In 1997 Oban was also twinned with Gorey, County Wexford, in Ireland.\n\n[9] Oban, Saskatchewan: Oban is an unincorporated area administered by the rural municipality of Biggar No. 347, in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Oban is located on Saskatchewan Highway 14 in western Saskatchewan. The closest town is Biggar to the southeast. Biggar railway station is a divisional point for the Canadian National Railway (CNR). Oban had the last provincial interlocking tower at the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway level crossing, which was constructed in 1910 and closed in 1990.\n\n[10] Oban Hills: The Oban hills, which take their name from the small town of Oban to the south, contain the largest area of unexploited lowland rain forest in Nigeria. It is possible that at one time the region was home to more people, perhaps being depopulated due to its proximity to the slave trading center of Calabar, and that the forest may actually be fairly recent growth. A 1988 report said that the remaining patches of forest on mountainous slopes were being encroached upon for logging and farming. Primates such as Preuss's guenon were being hunted for meat. The Oban Hills Forest Reserve was made a part of the Cross River National Park in 1991.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.

Peter Dickinson then edited What's On between 2001 and 2007. The editor after Dickinson was Neil Campbell. Campbell handed over editorial duties in 2011 to Lana Nicole Niland. What's On was then owned by PAN Publishing, who also published Panorama, the in-flight magazine of Ukraine International Airlines. The magazine ceased regular publication after the 2013/14 Revolution of Dignity in Ukraine. In the summer of 2014 a special edition of What's On was published, the \"Chronicle of a Revolution\" was a compendium of the news and photo coverage and some feature articles that had been published in What's On during the 12-week period of the revolution.\n\n[3] Marvelmania International: The first Marvelmania International membership kits included eight items for $1.75 plus 25¢ shipping:\"Marvelmania Magazine\" #1 listed Don Wallace as publisher and Mark Evanier as editor, with articles by Evanier, Tony Isabella, Bruce Schweiger and Ed Noonchester. The black-and-white front cover featured Captain America, penciled and inked by Jack Kirby. The back cover featured Spider-Man penciled and inked by Jim Steranko.\n\n[4] Inked (magazine): \"Inked\" debuted in late 2004 and was published quarterly for one year. In 2006, the magazine was purchased by Downtown Media Group but never published an issue. Pinchazo Publishing Group Inc acquired \"Inked\" in August 2007. The company hired creative director Todd Weinberger to redesign the magazine, then brought on editor Jason Buhrmester. Upon Burhmester's departure in the spring of 2010 Rocky Rakovic was tapped as Editor. Rakovic brought in celebrity contributors like Adam Levine, Jessica White and Adam Goldberg. Photographers such as Terry Richardson, Ellen Stagg and Warwick Saint have shot for \"Inked\".\n\n[5] Wet Ink: Wet Ink magazine was an Australian magazine devoted to publishing new Australian writing, with an emphasis on new and emerging writers. Published quarterly, it featured fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction, plus an interview with a writer and book reviews. Work published ranged from 'literary' to genre-based work. Works were complemented by photography, illustration and clever design.\n\n[6] Genome News Network: The Genome News Network (abbreviated GNN) is an online magazine that publishes news articles and educational resources about genomics and medicine. It was founded in 1999, with Barbara Culliton as the founding editor-in-chief. It was originally published by Celera Genomics. In 2001, the Institute for Genomic Research became the magazine's new publisher. An article published in \"the Lancet Oncology\" that year stated that the magazine \"offers news, original articles, the online reference book, \"What’s a genome?\", and primers on sequencing and assembling the genome – all well written and illustrated\". As of 2010, new issues of the magazine were published biweekly.\n\n[7] David Toussaint: Since 1997, Toussaint has written articles for \"Brides\" magazine, \"Conde Nast Traveler\", \"Working Woman\", \"Instinct\", \"Gay Financial Network\", \"Outsider Ink\", \"Caribbean Travel\" and \"Life and Diversion\" magazine. He has been an editor at Conde Nast and a three-time guest editor for Francis Ford Coppola's online magazine \"Zoetrope\", and was a full-time columnist for \"GayWeddings.com\". Currently he writes a weekly column and is a theater critic for \"EDGE magazine\", and is the senior editor for \"GuySpy.com.\" In 2003, Toussaint wrote an article entitled \"Outward Bound\" on same-sex weddings for \"Brides\" magazine. It was the first article on gay and lesbian weddings to be published by any of the five major, top-selling bridal magazines, and its publication created a significant controversy.\n\n[8] Ink (company): Ink, or Ink Global, is a global travel media publishing and technology company with its headquarters in London. Founded in 1994, Ink publishes 26 inflight magazines for 20 airlines worldwide, as of November 2017. The company's magazines and other media products currently reach more than 802 million global consumers annually.\n\n[9] TwoMorrows Publishing: \"Jack Kirby Collector\" was first published in limited quantities as a small, black-and-white magazine focusing on Kirby artwork and articles by Morrow and a few fellow collectors and fans. As each issue grew in size, it began to include rare or previously unpublished Kirby art, as well as uninked pencil versions of published art. Soon the magazine was being published on better paper, with glossy color covers. New and veteran comics artists were given the chance to ink reproductions of Kirby's original pencil work. Each issue carried the notation \"Fully Authorized by the Kirby Estate\". The magazine went on to be nominated for several awards. First issue was published September 5, 1994.\n\n[10] Josefina Ayerza: In 1990 she founded her own magazine, called Lacanian Ink, which gives special prominence to philosophy in dialogue with art, both marked by characteristics of the present period. J. Ayerza’s articles are published in Artforum, in Flash Art, in Lacanian Ink, L'Ane and Du on a regular basis.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the information provided in the contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do any of the contexts mention what articles Inked magazine publishes?\n\nPlease select one of the following options:\n\nYes, answer is present\nI don't know", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know (Unless specifically stated in a context, there's no information about what specific articles \"Inked Magazine\" publishes.)", "Orca-2-7b": "\nYes, answer is present.", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "Yes, answer is present"}}

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice—in 1956 and 1972. Maria Skłodowska-Curie also won two Nobel Prizes, for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911. William Lawrence Bragg was, until October 2014, the youngest ever Nobel laureate; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25. He remains the youngest recipient of the Physics Prize. Three women have won the prize: Curie, Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), and Donna Strickland (2018). As of 2018, the prize has been awarded to 209 individuals.\n\n[2] Asian Americans in science and technology: Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang received the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics for theoretical work demonstrating that the conservation of parity did not always hold and later became American citizens. Samuel Chao Chung Ting received the 1976 Nobel Prize in physics for discovery of the subatomic particle J/ψ. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar shared the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics and had the Chandra X-ray Observatory named after him. Steven Chu shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for his research in cooling and trapping atoms using laser light. Daniel Tsui shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics in 1998 for helping discover the fractional Quantum Hall effect. Yoichiro Nambu received the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the consequences of spontaneously broken symmetries in field theories. In 2009, Charles K. Kao was awarded Nobel Prize in Physics \"for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibres for optical communication.\" Shuji Nakamura won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes.\n\n[3] Brian Josephson: Brian David Josephson (born 4 January 1940) is a Welsh theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Cambridge. Best known for his pioneering work on superconductivity and quantum tunnelling, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his prediction of the Josephson effect, made in 1962 when he was a 22-year-old PhD student at Cambridge University. Josephson is the only Welshman to have won a Nobel Prize in Physics. He shared the prize with physicists Leo Esaki and Ivar Giaever, who jointly received half the award for their own work on quantum tunnelling.\n\n[4] University of Maryland, College Park: The university's faculty has included four Nobel Prize laureates. The earliest recipient, Juan Ramón Jiménez, was a professor of Spanish language and literature and won the 1956 prize for literature. Four decades later, physics professor William Daniel Phillips won the prize in physics for his contributions to laser cooling, a technique to slow the movement of gaseous atoms in 1997. In 2005, professor emeritus of economics and public policy Thomas Schelling was awarded the prize in economics for his contributions to game theory. In 2006, adjunct professor of physics and senior astrophysicist at NASA John C. Mather was awarded the prize in physics alongside George Smoot for their work in the discovery of blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation. In addition, two University of Maryland alumni are Nobel Prize laureates; Herbert Hauptman won the 1985 prize in chemistry and Raymond Davis Jr. won the 2002 prize in physics.\n\n[5] George Zweig: As pointed out by astrophysicist John Gribbin, Gell-Mann deservedly received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1969, for his overall contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions; at that time, quark theory had not become fully accepted, and was not specifically mentioned in the official citation of the prize. In later years, when quark theory became established as the standard model of particle physics, the Nobel committee presumably felt they couldn't recognize Zweig as the scientist who first spelled out the theory's implications in detail and suggested that they might be real, without including Gell-Mann again. Nevertheless, in 1977 Richard Feynman nominated both Gell-Mann and Zweig for the Nobel prize, presumed to be his only nomination for such. Whatever the reason, despite Zweig's contributions to a theory central to modern physics, he has not yet been awarded a Nobel prize.\n\n[6] Aage Bohr: Aage Niels Bohr (; 19 June 1922 – 8 September 2009) was a Danish nuclear physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1975 with Ben Mottelson and James Rainwater \"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\". Starting from Rainwater's concept of an irregular-shaped liquid drop model of the nucleus, Bohr and Mottelson developed a detailed theory that was in close agreement with experiments. Since his father, Niels Bohr, had won the prize in 1922, he and his father were one of the six pairs of fathers and sons who have both won the Nobel Prize and one of the four pairs who have both won the Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\n[7] Norwegian Americans: In science, Ernest Lawrence won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939. Lars Onsager won the 1968 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Norman Borlaug, father of the Green Revolution, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Christian B. Anfinsen won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1972. Ivar Giaever won the Nobel Prize in Physics 1973. Carl Richard Hagen is noted for his work in physics.\n\n[8] Henry Moseley: Isaac Asimov also speculated that, in the event that he had not been killed while in the service of the British Empire, Moseley might very well have been awarded the 1916 Nobel Prize in Physics, which, along with the prize for chemistry, was not awarded to anyone that year. Additional credence is given to this idea by noting the recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics in the two preceding years, 1914 and 1915, and in the following year, 1917. In 1914, Max von Laue of Germany won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals, which was a crucial step towards the invention of X-ray spectroscopy. Then, in 1915, William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg, a British father-son pair, shared this Nobel Prize for their discoveries in the reverse problem — determining the structure of crystals using X-rays (Robert Charles Bragg, William Henry Bragg's other son, had also been killed at Gallipoli, on 2 September 1915). Next, Moseley used the diffraction of X-rays by known crystals in measuring the X-ray spectra of metals. This was the first use of X-ray spectroscopy and also one more step towards the creation of X-ray crystallography. In addition, Moseley's methods and analyses substantially supported the concept of atomic number, placing it on a firm, physics-based foundation. Moreover, Charles Barkla of Great Britain was awarded the\n\n[9] Matrix mechanics: In 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics. The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933. It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 \"for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen\" and Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac shared the 1933 Prize \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\".\n\n[10] Nobel Prize controversies: Chien-Shiung Wu disproved the law of the conservation of parity (1956) and was the first Wolf Prize winner in physics. She died in 1997 without receiving a Nobel. Wu assisted Tsung-Dao Lee personally in his parity laws development—with Chen-Ning Yang—by providing him in 1956 with a possible test method for beta decay that worked successfully. Her book \"Beta Decay\" (1965) is still a sine qua non reference for nuclear physicists. Several Nobel Prizes were awarded for research related to the concepts of the boson, Bose–Einstein statistics and Bose–Einstein condensate—the latest being the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics given for advancing the theory of Bose–Einstein condensates although Satyendra Nath Bose himself was not awarded the Nobel Prize. In his book \"The Scientific Edge\", physicist Jayant Narlikar observed: \"SN Bose's work on particle statistics (c.1922), which clarified the behavior of photons (the particles of light in an enclosure) and opened the door to new ideas on statistics of Microsystems that obey the rules of quantum theory, was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science and could be considered in the Nobel Prize class.\" The work of other 20th century Indian scientists which Narlikar considered to be of Nobel Prize class were Srinivasa Ramanujan, Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman and Meghnad Saha.

Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania, the only U.S. state located outside North America, and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean.\n\n[2] Oceania: The most diverse country of Oceania when it comes to the environment is Australia, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and dry desert in the centre. Desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land. The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland. The northernmost point of the east coast is the tropical-rainforested Cape York Peninsula.\n\n[3] Cape Orange: In Brazil, both Cape Orange and the nearby mouth of the Oyapock River are often erroneously quoted as being the country's northernmost point, and until the mid- to late 20th century this information could even be found in many Brazilian schoolbooks. Actually, Brazil's most northerly point is far inland and hundreds of kilometres from there, on Monte Caburaí in the state of Roraima, almost a full degree more to the north. Cape Orange is indeed the northernmost point of the Brazilian coastline; the cape's western coastline ends at the Oyapock estuary, whose mouth marks the end of the Brazilian coast.\n\n[4] Demographics of Oceania: Oceania is a region centered on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Conceptions of what constitutes Oceania vary, with it being defined in various ways, often geopolitically or geographically. In the geopolitical conception used by the United Nations, International Olympic Committee, and many atlases, the Oceanic region includes Australia and the nations of the Pacific from Papua New Guinea east, but not the Malay Archipelago or Indonesian New Guinea. The term is sometimes used more specifically to denote Australasia as a geographic continent, or biogeographically as a synonym for either the Australasian ecozone (Wallacea and Australasia) or the Pacific ecozone (Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia apart either from New Zealand or from mainland New Guinea).\n\n[5] Nordic countries: Notable natural features of the Nordic countries include the Norwegian fjords, the Archipelago Sea between Finland and Sweden, the extensive volcanic and geothermal activity of Iceland, and Greenland, which is the largest island in the world. The southernmost point of the Nordic countries is Gedser, on the island of Falster in Denmark. The northernmost point is Kaffeklubben Island in Greenland, which is also the northernmost point of land on Earth. The largest cities and capitals of the Nordic countries are situated on the southern parts of the region, with the exception of Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland. Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm are all close to the same latitude as the southernmost point of Greenland, Egger Island (\"Itilleq\"): about 60°N.\n\n[6] Oyapock: The mouth of the Oyapock is the northern \"end\" of Brazil's coastline, as it is where the border between Brazil and French Guiana meets the ocean, but nearby Cape Orange, which separates the Bay of Oyapock from the Atlantic Ocean, is the northernmost \"point\" of the Brazilian coast. In Brazil, both the cape and the mouth of the Oyapock are often mistaken for the whole country's northernmost point (rather than just of its coastline), and in the past this information could even be found in geography schoolbooks. Yet the true northernmost point in Brazil is actually far inland, on Monte Caburaí, in the state of Roraima, hundreds of kilometers from the Oyapock and almost a full degree more to the north.\n\n[7] Northland Region: The northernmost points of the North Island mainland lie at the top of Northland. These include several points often confused in the public mind as being the country's northernmost points: Cape Maria van Diemen, Spirits Bay, Cape Reinga, and North Cape. The northernmost point of the North Island is actually the Surville Cliffs, close to North Cape although the northernmost point of the country is further north, in the Kermadec chain of islands. Cape Reinga and Spirits Bay, however, have a symbolic part to play as the end of the country. In Māori mythology, it is from here that the souls of the dead depart on their journey to the afterlife.\n\n[8] Sport in Oceania: Currently, Vanuatu is the only country in Oceania to call football its national sport. However, it is the most popular sport in Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, and has a significant (and growing) popularity in Australia. Oceania has been represented at four World Cup finals tournaments — Australia in 1974 and 2006 and New Zealand in 1982 and 2010. In 2006, Australia joined the Asian Football Confederation and qualified for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups as an Asian entrant. New Zealand qualified through the Oceania Confederation, winning its playoff against Bahrain. This made 2010 the first time that two countries from (geographic) Oceania had qualified at the same time, albeit through different confederations.\n\n[9] Norway: Norway comprises the western and northernmost part of Scandinavia in Northern Europe. Norway lies between latitudes 57° and 81° N, and longitudes 4° and 32° E. Norway is the northernmost of the Nordic countries and if Svalbard is included also the easternmost. Vardø at 31° 10' 07\" east of Greenwich lies further east than St. Petersburg and Istanbul. Norway includes the northernmost point on the European mainland. The rugged coastline is broken by huge fjords and thousands of islands. The coastal baseline is . The coastline of the mainland including fjords stretches , when islands are included the coastline has been estimated to . Norway shares a land border with Sweden, with Finland, and with Russia to the east. To the north, west and south, Norway is bordered by the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea, and Skagerrak. The Scandinavian Mountains form much of the border with Sweden.\n\n[10] Oceania: The islands at the geographic extremes of Oceania are the Bonin Islands, a politically integral part of Japan; Hawaii, a state of the United States; Clipperton Island, a possession of France; the Juan Fernández Islands, belonging to Chile; and the Campbell Islands, belonging to New Zealand. Oceania has a diverse mix of economies from the highly developed and globally competitive financial markets of Australia and New Zealand, which rank high in quality of life and human development index, to the much less developed economies that belong to countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, while also including medium-sized economies of Pacific islands such as Palau, Fiji and Tonga. The largest and most populous country in Oceania is Australia, with Sydney being the largest city of both Oceania and Australia.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the answer to the following question:\nWhat is the northernmost country in Oceania?\n\nNote: Please answer based on the given contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

The Best FIFA Football Awards are the annual recognitions awarded by FIFA to several individuals across different categories, including: best eleven players of the year, known as FIFA FIFPro World XI (awards goalkeeper, best defenders l, midfielders, attackers), FIFA World Coach of the Year for men's and for women's football, best female player of the year, 2nd best male player of the year, and best goal of the year (known as FIFA Puskás Award). The FIFA Fair Play Award is the only award that usually goes to groups or entities instead of individuals.\n\n[2] FIFA Player of the Century: Since 1991, FIFA have had awards for FIFA World Player of the Year and they decided to bring in the new millennium by conducting a public vote to decide the FIFA Player of the Century. This was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet-based poll by wide margins, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pelé. Despite the fact that Eusébio, who played football professionally during Pelé's era, placed third in the poll, many observers complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not Pelé. As a result, FIFA decided to add a second poll and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists, officials and coaches, who voted Pelé the best player of the century with 72.75% of the vote, thus both were joint winners of the award.\n\n[3] FIFA Player of the Century: FIFA Player of the Century was a one-off award created by FIFA to decide the greatest football player of the 20th century, announced at the annual FIFA World gala, held in Rome on 11 December 2000. Diego Maradona and Pelé were joint winners of the award. Maradona won the award based on the Internet poll, while Pelé won the award based on votes from FIFA officials, journalists and coaches.\n\n[4] List of Germany international footballers: Matthäus was the inaugural winner of the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1991, and is one of five Germany players to have been awarded European Footballer of the Year; two of which, Franz Beckenbauer and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, have each won the award twice. Beckenbauer was also voted in eighth place for the FIFA Player of the Century award, and was selected for the World Team of the 20th Century. Ten German players were named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by former footballer Pelé, and ten are in the FIFA Century Club, having earned 100 or more caps. Lothar Matthäus's 150 international appearances make him the ninth-most capped player in world football, and Miroslav Klose's 71 goals is the eleventh-most of any international player.\n\n[5] Luka Modrić: Due to his club, and national team performance at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. where also received the Golden Ball, in August and September Modrić won the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award and The Best FIFA Men's Player Award, while in December, he added the Ballon d'Or to his personal tally, making the first time since 2008 and 2014 that the awards were not won by Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, which was seen in the media as an end to their decade-long triumphant rivalry. Furthermore, besides becoming the first Croatian player to win these awards, Modrić was the first player to win both the World Cup Golden Ball and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award in the same year since Ronaldo in 1998, and the World Cup Golden Ball and the Best FIFA Men's Player of the Year Award after Romário in 1994. Additionally, he is the first player to win the awards from the former SFR Yugoslavia territory, the first footballer to win the Ballon d'Or from Eastern Europe after Andriy Shevchenko in 2004, and the tenth player from Real Madrid to capture the trophy. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker award, and was included in the FIFA World XI for the fourth time, and UEFA Team of the Year for the third time in his career.\n\n[6] The Best FIFA Men's Player: The Best FIFA Men's Player is an association football award presented annually by the sport's governing body, FIFA, to the world's best men's player. The award is aimed at reviving the FIFA World Player of the Year, which was merged with \"France Football\" 's Ballon d'Or in 2010 to become the FIFA Ballon d'Or in a six-year partnership.\n\n[7] FIFA World Player of the Year: During the men's era, Brazilian players won 8 out of 19 years, compared to three wins – the second most – for French players. In terms of individual players, Brazil again led with five, followed by Italy and Portugal with two each. The youngest winner was Ronaldo, who won at 20 years old in 1996, and the oldest winner was Fabio Cannavaro, who won aged 33 in 2006. Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane each won the award three times, while Ronaldo and Ronaldinho were the only players to win in successive years. From 2010 to 2015, the equivalent men's award was the FIFA Ballon d'Or, following a merging of the FIFA World Player of the Year and the France Football Ballon d'Or awards. Since 2016, the awards have been replaced by the Best FIFA Men's Player and the Best FIFA Women's Player awards.\n\n[8] International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics: Based on this statistical study series, the below six clubs were named as \"continental clubs of the century\" by the IFFHS between 10 September and 13 October 2009. These clubs were awarded with a golden trophy and a certificate during the \"World Football Gala\" celebrated at Fulham, London, on 11 May 2010.The IFFHS World's Best Playmaker is a footballing award which, since 2006, is given annually to the best playmaker of the year, as chosen by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS). The award is awarded every January at the \"World Football Gala\": the winning playmaker is awarded a gold trophy. Spain's Xavi has won the award a record four consecutive times, compatriot Andrés Iniesta two times and Argentine Lionel Messi has won the award in the last three years. Barcelona is the club with the most wins, with nine in total. \"From 1991 until 2009, FIFA continued this distinction named \"FIFA World Player of the Year\"; this award was later replaced by the FIFA Ballon d'Or in 2010, and The Best FIFA Men's Player in 2016.\"In 2017, IFFHS started to nominate a world team of the year. Coach: Zinedine Zidane \"(Real Madrid)\"\n\n[9] FIFA Female Player of the Century: FIFA Female Player of the Century was a one-off award created by the global governing body FIFA to decide the greatest football female player of the 20th century, announced at the annual FIFA World gala, held in Rome on 11 December 2000. American player Michelle Akers and Chinese player Sun Wen were joint winners of the award. Michelle Akers won the award based on votes from FIFA officials, journalists and coaches, while Sun Wen won the award based on the Internet poll.\n\n[10] The Best FIFA Football Awards 2017: A panel of experts on men's football representing various FIFA and external football stakeholders compiled a shortlist of 24 male players for The Best FIFA Men's Player. The 24 candidates were announced on 17 August. The three finalists were announced on 22 September 2017.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nWho was the male football player that won the Best FIFA football awards player in 2017?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Its jurisdiction covers the legality of the decisions of government officials, and its decisions are final. Appeals are made to the Supreme Administrative Court from the decisions of the administrative courts of Helsinki, Turku, Hämeenlinna, Kouvola, Kuopio, Vaasa, Oulu, Rovaniemi and Åland Islands, the Market Court, and the Council of State.\n\n[2] British Hong Kong: The judicial system was based on English law, with Chinese customary law taking a secondary role in civil cases involving Chinese residents. The Supreme Court was the highest court and ruled on all civil and criminal cases in the colony. During the early colonial period, extraterritorial appellate cases from other regions of China involving British subjects were also tried in this court. Further appeals from the Supreme Court were heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which exercised final adjudication over the entire British Empire.\n\n[3] North Korea: North Korea has a civil law system based on the Prussian model and influenced by Japanese traditions and communist legal theory. Judiciary procedures are handled by the Supreme Court (the highest court of appeal), provincial or special city-level courts, people's courts and special courts. People's courts are at the lowest level of the system and operate in cities, counties and urban districts, while different kinds of special courts handle cases related to military, railroad or maritime matters.\n\n[4] Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan: The Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan is the highest court of appeal in the legal system of Kyrgyzstan. The Supreme Court also has supervisory powers over lower courts and, since the abolition of the Constitutional Court under the 2010 Constitution, determines the constitutionality of laws. Court's website\n\n[5] Shen Deyong: Shen Deyong (; born March 1954) is a Chinese politician and grand justice currently serving as director of the Committee for Social and Legal Affairs of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) since March 2018. At the height of his political career, he served as executive vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, the highest level of court in China. Shen formally resigned from the government in June 2018, which was a shock to the news media.\n\n[6] Politics of Vietnam: The Vietnamese judicial system is based upon Socialist legality. The country's highest judicial organ is the Supreme People's Court (SPC) (). The composition of the SCP includes the Chief Justice (), Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SCP (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, Central Military Court, Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SCP is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic has the power to nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the operating principles of the courts are, during hearings, that the \"judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws.\" Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.\n\n[7] Politics of Croatia: Croatia has a three-tiered, independent judicial system governed by the Constitution of Croatia and national legislation enacted by the Sabor. The Supreme Court () is the highest court of appeal in Croatia, while municipal and county courts are courts of general jurisdiction. Specialised courts in Croatia are: commercial courts and the Superior Commercial Court, misdemeanour courts and the Superior Misdemeanour Court, administrative courts and the Superior Administrative Court. Croatian Constitutional Court () is a court that deals primarily with constitutional law. Its main authority is to rule on whether laws that are challenged are in fact unconstitutional, i.e., whether they conflict with constitutionally established rights and freedoms. The State Attorney's Office represents the state in legal proceedings.\n\n[8] Constitutional Court of Kyrgyzstan: The Constitutional Court of Kyrgyzstan was formerly the highest court of Kyrgyzstan's legal system. It judges on the constitutionality of laws and is composed of nine judges. Critics argue that its politically charged judgement such as allowing President Akayev to re-run for President despite the Presidency being limited by term limits are evidence of a lack of judicial independence. The Constitutional Court was abolished in 2010 with the adoption of the new Constitution and its powers transferred to the Supreme Court.\n\n[9] Court of Appeal (England and Wales): The Court of Appeal (COA, formally \"Her Majesty's Court of Appeal in England\") is the highest court within the Senior Courts of England and Wales, and second in the legal system of England and Wales only to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The COA was created in 1875, and today comprises 39 Lord Justices of Appeal and Lady Justices of Appeal.\n\n[10] Wales: English law is regarded as a common law system, with no major codification of the law and legal precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive.The court system is headed by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases. The Senior Courts of England and Wales is the highest court of first instance as well as an appellate court. The three divisions are the Court of Appeal; the High Court of Justice and the Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by the Magistrates' Courts or the County Court. In 2007 the Wales and Cheshire Region (known as the Wales and Cheshire Circuit before 2005) came to an end when Cheshire was attached to the North-Western England Region. From that point, Wales became a legal unit in its own right, although it remains part of the single jurisdiction of England and Wales.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the question based on the information provided in the contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question \"What is the highest court in the Chinese legal system?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nContext [2] mentions the Supreme Court as the highest court in the British Hong Kong legal system.

It is not complicated to work with, and a bare hammering can be enough to transform a nugget into a bead. The eye-catching look of native copper makes it easy to recognize, and even flashier if converted into jewelry, a possible motivation for humankind to start the metallurgy with it. An evolutive technological process (Coghlan 1975, Mohen 1992; 48) has been described, although there are authors like Javinovic (Mohen 1992; 52) who think that it is not necessary to pass through the first stages to reach the last one.\n\n[2] History of chemistry: Practical attempts to improve the refining of ores and their extraction to smelt metals was an important source of information for early chemists in the 16th century, among them Georg Agricola (1494–1555), who published his great work \"De re metallica\" in 1556. His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time. His approach removed the mysticism associated with the subject, creating the practical base upon which others could build. The work describes the many kinds of furnace used to smelt ore, and stimulated interest in minerals and their composition. It is no coincidence that he gives numerous references to the earlier author, Pliny the Elder and his \"Naturalis Historia\". Agricola has been described as the \"father of metallurgy\".\n\n[3] Metallurgy during the Copper Age in Europe: Consequently, the way in which metallurgy was initiated differs considerably depending on the region. There are areas in which copper seems to play a crucial role (i.e., the Balkans), whereas other areas show no interest in it at all. Then there are societies that use copper artifacts but do not practice metallurgy (Mohen 1992; 71), and there are other ones that fully adopt some of the cultural innovations but ignore the rest. One example of the latter is Basque country in northern Spain, where splendid large dolmens are present along the Ebro river, but metal is rather infrequent, and when it does appear between the trapping, it is more often bronze or arsenical copper than copper (Cava 1984).\n\n[4] Robert Hutton: Hutton became the first Goldsmiths’ Professor in Metallurgy at Cambridge University in 1931. Although some of the pioneer work in metallography had been carried out by Heycock and Neville in the University Chemical Laboratory and formed part of the course in assaying chemistry, metallurgy was not included as a separate subject in the Natural Sciences Tripos. The Goldsmiths’ Company had generously provided funds for a small laboratory and endowed a chair, but it was Hutton who first persuaded the university to introduce metallurgy into Part II of the Natural Sciences Tripos and later Part I.\n\n[5] Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America: Metallurgy in pre-Columbian America is the extraction and purification of metals, as well as creating metal alloys and fabrication with metal by Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to European contact in the late 15th century. Indigenous Americans have been using native metals from ancient times, with recent finds of gold artifacts in the Andean region dated to 2155–1936 BCE, and North American copper finds dated to approximately 5000 BCE. The metal would have been found in nature without need for smelting techniques and shaped into the desired form using heat and cold hammering techniques without chemically altering it by alloying it. To date \"no one has found evidence that points to the use of melting, smelting and casting in prehistoric eastern North America.\" In South America the case is quite different. Indigenous South Americans had full metallurgy with smelting and various metals being purposely alloyed. Metallurgy in Mesoamerica and Western Mexico may have developed following contact with South America through Ecuadorian marine traders.\n\n[6] Josiah Marshall Heath: At the start of the 19th century, metallurgy in British India was very traditional, localised and artisanal. Around 1825, Heath (who wanted to continue the important progress of European methods), obtained from the British East India Company the monopoly of iron production over a large area centred on Madras. In 1830, factories were built at Porto Novo, in the south of the Arcot district, with a government loan.\n\n[7] Mining and metallurgy in medieval Europe: By the end of the 9th century, economic and social conditions, which dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups, and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted. Smelting sites were multiplied and new mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known Mines of Rammelsberg, close to the town of Goslar by the Harz Mountains. Open-cast mining and metallurgical activities were mostly concentrated in the Eastern Alps, Saxony, Bohemia, Tuscany, the Rhineland, Gaul and Spain (Nef 1987). French, Flemish, but mainly German miners and metallurgists were the generators of metal production.\n\n[8] Bronze Age: There is a longstanding debate about whether the development of both copper and iron metallurgy were independently developed in sub-Saharan Africa or were introduced from the outside across the Sahara Desert from North Africa or from the Indian Ocean. Evidence for theories of independent development and for outside introduction are scarce and subject to active scholarly debate. Scholars have suggested that both the relative dearth of archeological research in sub-Saharan Africa as well as long standing prejudices have limited or biased our understanding of pre-historic metallurgy on the continent. One scholar characterized the state of historical knowledge as such: “To say that the history of metallurgy in sub-Saharan Africa is complicated is perhaps an understatement.”\n\n[9] Department of Materials, University of Oxford: The Department of Metallurgy was founded in the mid 1950s by Professor Hume-Rothery. In the early 1950s, Hume-Rothery was a Reader in Metallurgy in the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, and Metallurgy was taught as an option in the Chemistry degree. In rapid succession, during the second half of the 1950s, the Wolfson Chair in Metallurgy was established, Hume-Rothery was appointed as the first Wolfson Professor, an independent Department of Metallurgy was set up with a grant from the General Board, a separate final honours school in Metallurgy was established, the first students entered the course in 1960. The department was initially housed in a hut in Keble Road, until new accommodation, the Hume-Rothery building was completed in 1960. Since then, the department has gradually expanded into a total of almost 8,000 sq m, distributed over 7 buildings in the Keble Road Triangle, just north of the city centre. In December 1999, it acquired another 6,500 sq m, distributed over more than 10 buildings at the (subsequently renamed) Oxford University Begbroke Science Park (OUBSP), 5 miles away, just north of the ring road, half occupied by the departments industry-linked research, and half occupied by high-tech spin-out materials related companies.\n\n[10] Metallurgy during the Copper Age in Europe: The theory that metallurgy was imported into Europe from the Near East has been practically ruled out. A second hypothesis, that there were two main points of origin of metallurgy in Europe, in southern Spain and in West Bulgaria, is also doubtful due to the existence of sites outside the centers of diffusion where metallurgy was known simultaneously with, or before, those in the ‘original’ nuclei, such as Brixlegg (Tyrol, Austria), while sites closer to the supposed origins of metallurgy, such as in the north of Spain, show fewer metal artifacts than sites in the south and practically no evidence of production (Perez Arrondo 1986).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [2], [3], [5], [7], and [10].\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

McKeith: McKeith is credited with bringing together international researchers to develop and refine diagnostic criteria for Lewy body dementias (LBD). In 2015, he was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award in Alzheimer's Research from the Alzheimer's Association for his groundbreaking work in LBD. He was also honoured that year by the Lewy Body Dementia Association for his work in LBD advocacy and research. As a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Lewy Body Dementia Association, he led the Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium effort that published new diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies in 2017.\n\n[2] Kartinah: Suria (Astaman), a commander at the Air Raid Preparation team (, or LBD), has fallen in love with the nurse Kartinah (Ratna Asmara), who serves with the LBD. However, he is married to Titi (Tante Han), a woman who has lost her sanity. Although Suria's uncle (R. Inoe Perbatasari) suggests that Suria take Kartinah as a second wife, Kartinah refuses, as she considers herself a modern woman and not bound by traditional practices.\n\n[3] Ligand-gated ion channel: The ionotropic glutamate receptors bind the neurotransmitter glutamate. They form tetramers with each subunit consisting of an extracellular amino terminal domain (ATD, which is involved tetramer assembly), an extracellular ligand binding domain (LBD, which binds glutamate), and a transmembrane domain (TMD, which forms the ion channel). The transmembrane domain of each subunit contains three transmembrane helices as well as a half membrane helix with a reentrant loop. The structure of the protein starts with the ATD at the N terminus followed by the first half of the LBD which is interrupted by helices 1,2 and 3 of the TMD before continuing with the final half of the LBD and then finishing with helix 4 of the TMD at the C terminus. This means there are three links between the TMD and the extracellular domains. Each subunit of the tetramer has a binding site for glutamate formed by the two LBD sections forming a clamshell like shape. Only two of these sites in the tetramer need to be occupied to open the ion channel. The pore is mainly formed by the half helix 2 in a way which resembles an inverted potassium channel.\n\n[4] EPI-001: EPI-001 is a mixture of four stereoisomers. EPI-001 binds to the activation function-1 (AF-1) region in the NTD of the AR, as opposed to virtually all other AR antagonists, which bind to the C-terminal LBD. A functional AF-1 is essential for the AR to have transcriptional activity. If AF-1 is deleted or mutated, the AR will still bind androgens, but will have no transcriptional activity. Importantly, if the AR lacks an LBD, the receptor will be nuclear and constitutively-active. Constitutively active splice variants of the AR that lack the C-terminal LBD are correlated to CRPC and poor survival. EPI-001 is an inhibitor of constitutively active splice variant of ARs that lack the C-terminal LBD. Conventional antiandrogens do not inhibit constitutively-active variants of AR that have a truncated or deleted C-terminal LBD.\n\n[5] Student Volunteer Army: SVA Founder Sam Johnson chaired the planning committee for the inaugural \"Looking Beyond Disasters\" (LBD). LBD is an initiative of the NZ National Commission for UNESCO in partnership with the Bangkok UNESCO Office and the UNESCO Office of the Pacific in Apia. The focus of the program is to bring together young people who have experienced natural disasters in the Asia Pacific region to share disaster experiences and develop realistic action plans to rebuild communities that meet the needs and aspirations of young people.\n\n[6] LBD: LBD may refer to:\n\n[7] Lewy Body Dementia Association: According to a 2014 review, the LBDA provides services that aid society and families with LBD. They provide support and awareness, reduce stress on individuals and families with LBD, and may reduce use of healthcare. They help enable better diagnoses and better understanding of LBD.\n\n[8] Bill Robinson (scientist): Robinson is most well known for his invention of the lead rubber bearing (LRB) seismic isolation device. He designed the LRB in 1974 while working as a scientist for DSIR (Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Zealand). As he was a public service employee when he invented the device, the LRB patent was owned by the state. The LRB is used under more than US$100 billion worth of structures around the world , including New Zealand's Te Papa Tongarewa (National Museum of New Zealand), the new Wellington Hospital, Victoria University Library and Parliament Buildings. Most significant bridges in NZ use base isolation technology.\n\n[9] Lewy body dementia: Lewy body dementias are more often misdiagnosed than any other common dementia. Most people with DLB had not heard of the condition prior to diagnosis; general awareness about LBD lags well behind that of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, even though LBD is the second most common dementia, after Alzheimer's. It is not only frustrating for families and caregivers to find that few people, including many healthcare professionals, are knowledgeable about LBD; lack of knowledge can have significant health consequences because people with LBD have severe sensitivity to antipsychotics often used to treat the symptoms. The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) and the Lewy Body Society promote awareness and provide support that helps society, by reducing costly use of healthcare, and families with LBD, by reducing stress. These organizations, and others in Argentina, Australia and Japan, help raise knowledge and help families with LBD become advocates to raise awareness about the disease.\n\n[10] Robert Ledley: Robert Steven Ledley (June 28, 1926 – July 24, 2012), Professor of Physiology and Biophysics and Professor of Radiology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, pioneered the use of electronic digital computers in biology and medicine. In 1959, he wrote two influential articles in \"Science\": \"Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis\" (with Lee B. Lusted) and \"Digital Electronic Computers in Biomedical Science\". Both articles encouraged biomedical researchers and physicians to adopt computer technology. In 1960 he established the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF), a non-profit research organization dedicated to promoting the use of computers and electronic equipment in biomedical research. At the NBRF Ledley pursued several major projects: the early 1960s development of the Film Input to Digital Automatic Computer (FIDAC), which automated the analysis of chromosomes; the invention of the Automatic Computerized Transverse Axial (ACTA) whole-body CT scanner in the mid-1970s; managing the \"Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure\" (created in 1965 by Margaret O. Dayhoff); and the establishment of the Protein Information Resource in 1984. Ledley also served as editor of several major peer-reviewed biomedical journals. In 1990, Ledley was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. He was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1997. He retired as president and research director of the NBRF in 2010.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix \"-ly\", but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase \"the woman walked quickly\" the adverb \"quickly\" derived from the adjective \"quick\" describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as \"good\" which has the adverbial form \"well\".\n\n[2] Thursday Next: Adjective-creating creatures and maggot-like in appearance, bookworms act as portable thesauri, changing common adjectives into others (for example \"nice\" into \"amiable\" or \"attractive\"). Their presence is welcome in most areas, however, should too many infest one area, the area uses too many adjectives and \"flowery language\", making the text unreadable.\n\n[3] Fairy: The label of \"fairy\" has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, small stature, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery. At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes. \"Fairy\" has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to \"enchanted\" or \"magical\".\n\n[4] Heinz Christian Pander: Pander performed important studies in the field of paleontology, being known for his extensive research on fossils found in the Devonian and Silurian geological strata of the Baltic regions. His study of trilobites from this age led to the adjective 'Panderian', first used by the Canadian palaeontologist, Elkanah Billings. Pander is credited as the first scientist to describe primitive creatures known as conodonts.\n\n[5] Vespertine (biology): Vespertine is a term used in the life sciences to indicate something of, relating to, or occurring in the evening. In botany, a vespertine flower is one that opens or blooms in the evening. In zoology, the term is used for a creature that becomes active at dusk, such as bats and owls. Strictly speaking, however, the term means that activity ceases during the hours of full darkness and does not resume until the next evening. Activity that continues throughout the night should be described as nocturnal.\n\n[6] Quenya grammar: An adjective in Quenya \"agrees\" with the noun it describes as regards number, but in general not with respect to case. In other words, the adjectives have specific plural forms, which are used if the corresponding noun is in (ordinary) plural. On the other hand, the case of the noun in general does not influence the form of the adjective.\n\n[7] The Minister's Cat: All players sit in a circle, and the first player describes the minister's cat with an adjective beginning with the letter 'A' (for example, \"The minister's cat is an \"adorable cat\"\") Each player then does the same, using different adjectives starting with the same letter. Once everyone has done so, the first player describes the cat with an adjective beginning with the letter 'B'. This continues for each letter of the alphabet. In all variations, a player is \"out\" of the game if they are unable to think of an adjective, or if they repeat one previously used (or can't remember the adjectives which have gone before, in the last variant). Players may clap in unison or speak in a rhythmic manner during the game, setting the pace for each player to speak his line; if a player falls too far behind the pace while thinking of an adjective, he may also be declared \"out.\"\n\n[8] Coruscant: The word itself originates in the late 15th century from the Latin \"coruscant-\" 'vibrating, glittering', from the verb \"coruscare\". It is described in the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\" as a poetic and literary adjective meaning 'glittering; sparkling'. The word \"coruscant\" is also a French adjective which means glittering, sparkling and, as a literary adjective, can be used to describe a decadent and overcomplicated language, decorum or community.\n\n[9] Slovene grammar: Some adjectives expressing \"properties\" next to masculine nouns imply definiteness ('relation') or indefiniteness ('quality') of nouns. For an exactly defined noun or a specific type thereof: For nouns not exactly defined, being mentioned for the first time or generic: Adjectives ending in \"-i\" and all possessive pronouns do not have special indefinite forms. There are two special adjectives which have special definite and indefinite forms for all genders and all cases, namely \"majhen\" (small) and \"velik\" (big) (the definite forms are \"mali\" and \"veliki\" respectively):The adjective matches the subject or the predicate article to which it is ascribed. If it describes two singular nouns or one dual noun, the adjective should be in the dual. If it describes a plural or one singular and one non-singular noun, the adjective should be in the plural. Although gender should match the group, sometimes the gender of the adjacent noun is used with the appropriate grammatical number. For declension patterns of adjectives, see the section on nouns (the fourth declension is always adjectival). Some adjectives, however, are never declined, for example \"bež\" (beige), \"poceni\" (cheap), \"roza\" (pink), \"super\" (super), \"seksi\" (sexy), and some other loanwords.\n\n[10] Bespoke: The word \"bespoke\" is most known for its \"centuries-old relationship\" with tailor-made suits, but the Oxford English Dictionary also ties the word to shoemaking in the mid-1800s. Although it is now used as an adjective, it was originally used as the past participle of \"bespeak\". According to a spokesperson for Collins English Dictionary, it later came to mean \"to discuss\", and then to the adjective describing something that was \"discussed in advance\", which is how it came to be associated with tailor-made apparel. The word was used as an adjective in \"A Narrative of the Life of Mrs Charlotte Charke\", the 1755 autobiography of the actress Charlotte Charke, which refers to \"The Beaux' Stratagem\" as \"a bespoke play\". After that, the adjective was generally associated with men's tailor-made suits.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease provide the answer to the question \"The adjective 'vespine' is used to describe which creature?\" with a \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" response.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the answer to the question?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [2].\nThe adjective \"vespine\" is used to describe a creature.

A successful plea would make the contract void \"ab initio\".\n\n[2] Terminus post quem: An archaeological example of a \"terminus ante quem\" would be deposits formed before a historically dateable event, such as building foundations that were partly demolished to make way for the construction of a city wall. If it is known that the wall was finished in 650, then the foundations must have been demolished in 650 or earlier; all that can be said from the evidence is that it happened before the known event.\n\n[3] Terminus post quem: Terminus post quem (\"limit after which\", often abbreviated to \"TPQ\") and terminus ante quem (\"limit before which\", abbreviated to \"TAQ\") specify the known limits of dating for events. A \"terminus post quem\" is the earliest time the event may have happened, and a \"terminus ante quem\" is the latest. An event may well have both a \"terminus post quem\" and a \"terminus ante quem\", in which case the limits of the possible range of dates are known at both ends, but many events have just one or the other. Similarly, terminus ad quem (\"limit to which\") is the latest possible date of a non-punctual event (period, era, etc.), while terminus a quo (\"limit from which\") is the earliest. The concepts are similar to those of upper and lower bounds in mathematics.\n\n[4] Óengus of Tallaght: The precise date of the original composition has proved difficult to ascertain. The usual method of determining a \"terminus post quem\" has been to argue from the careers of saints and kings referred to in the text, many of whom remain obscure. The \"terminus ante quem\" is a different game. In view of the selective nature of the \"Félire\", arguments from silence have little to recommend it, at least in individual cases. What would have been instructive, the year of Óengus's death, is unknown, but his education by Máel Ruain (d. 792) must at least mean that he did not outlive the 9th century.\n\n[5] Terminus post quem: For example, consider an archaeological find of a burial that contains coins dating to 1588, 1595, and others less securely dated to 1590–1625. The \"terminus post quem\" for the burial would be the latest date established with certainty: in this case, 1595. A secure dating of an older coin to an earlier date would not shift the \"terminus post quem\".\n\n[6] Terminus post quem: Other examples of things that may establish a \"terminus\" are known dates of death or travel by persons involved, a particular form of heraldry that can be dated (see pastiglia for example), references to reigning monarchs or office-holders, or a placing relative to any other events whose date is securely known. In a modern context, dated images, such as those available in Google Earth, may establish termini.\n\n[7] Codex Alexandrinus: Codex Alexandrinus contains the Epistle of Athanasius on the Psalms to Marcellinus, so it cannot be considered earlier than A.D. 373 (\"terminus post quem\"). In the Acts and Epistles we cannot find such chapter divisions, whose authorship is ascribed to Euthalius, Bishop of Sulci, come into vogue before the middle of the fifth century. It is \"terminus ad quem\". The presence of Epistle of Clement, which was once read in Churches recalls to a period when the canon of Scripture was in some particulars not quite settled. It is certain that the writing of the manuscript appears to be somewhat more advanced than that of the Vaticanus or Sinaiticus, especially in the enlargement of initial letters. It is also more decorated, though its ornamentations are already found in earlier manuscripts.\n\n[8] Cecilie Ore: Towards the end of the 80s, Orce gradually introduced a compositional focus on time, a focus that would lead to work cycles \"Codex Temporis\" and \"Tempura Mutantur\". \"Codex Temporis\" comprises works \"Praesens Subitus\" (for string quartet 1989), \"Futurum Exactum\" (for 12 strings 1992), \"Erat Erit Est\" (for sinfonietta 1991) and \"Lex Temporis\" (for string quartet 1992). The ideas presented in \"Codex Temporis\" were further developed in \"Tempura Mutantor\" which is made up of works \"Non Nunquam\" (for string trio 1999), \"Nunquam Non\" (for ensemble 1999), \"Semper Semper\" (for saxophone quartet 1998) and \"Ictus\" (for six percussionists 1997). Subsequent instrumental works constitute a trilogy in which all thre works are give titles derived from various cloud formations: \"Cirrus\" (for string quartet 2002), \"Cirrocumulis\" (for wind trio 2002) and \"Cirrostratus\" (for sinfonietta 2004).\n\n[9] Terminus post quem: A \"terminus ante quem non\" differs from a \"terminus post quem\" by not implying the event necessarily took place. 'Event E happened after time T' implies E occurred, whereas 'event E did not happen before time T' leaves open the possibility that E never occurred at all.\n\n[10] Publican: With the rise of a much larger Imperial bureaucracy, this task of the publicans, as well as their overall importance, declined precipitously. Evidence for the existence of publicans extends as far back as the 3rd century BC, although it is generally assumed that they existed at still earlier times in Roman history. Knowledge of a tentative \"terminus post quem\" is taken from the histories of the 1st century AD Imperial historian Livy.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [3].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the answer to the question \"What is terminus non Post Quem?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nThe answer is \"Non est factum\" which means \"it is not [my] deed\" in Latin, and it is a defense in contract law that allows a signing party", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Stretching in a northwest-southeast direction, the mountain range is situated in northwestern, eastern, and southeastern part of the city of Kerman, northeast of the town of Zarand, and southwest of the town of Ravar. With an elevation of 4233 metres, the highest point of the range is Mount Pelvar (Kuh-e Pelvar) or Mount Palvar (Kuh-e Palvar) that is located southeast of the city of Kerman and about 25 kilometres east of the town of Mahan.\n\n[2] Kerman Province: Kerman Province (, \"Ostān-e Kermān\") is the largest province of the 31 provinces of Iran. Kerman is in the southeast of Iran with its administrative center in the city of Kerman. In 2014 it was placed in Region 5. Mentioned in ancient times as the Achamenid satrapy of Carmania, it is the first-largest province of Iran with an area of , that encompasses nearly 11 percent of the land area of Iran. The population of the province is about 3 million (9th in the country).\n\n[3] Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman: Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (SBUK) is a research institution and university of engineering and science in Iran, offering both undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Located in Kerman province of Iran, the university is among the top ten universities and research institutes in Iran, illustrating its high status in research and education. The Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman occupies an area of 5 million square meters, making it one of the largest universities in Iran and the region. The university has two major campuses in the city of Kerman and several smaller campuses spread out across the province of Kerman offering degrees in over 100 different specialties leading to B.A., B.Sc., M.A., M.Sc., D.V.M., or Ph.D. degrees. Although there has been some moves by the smaller campuses in the province to become independent universities, there are still strong ties between these newly established universities and The Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman. The college of art and architecture is Saba Faculty of Art and Architecture, named after Afzalipour's wife. Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman was appointed as the Center of Excellence (fa:قطب علمی) by Iran's Ministry of Science and Technology ( Higher Education) in the field of Mathematics. In 1980 the Department of Mathematics was awarded the first doctoral degree in mathematics in all of Iran. Moreover, the second and third doctoral candidates in mathematics awarded in the\n\n[4] Kerman: It is the largest and most developed city in Kerman Province and the most important city in the southeast of Iran. It is also one of the largest cities of Iran in terms of area. Kerman is famous for its long history and strong cultural heritage . The city is home to many historic mosques and Zoroastrian fire temples. Kerman became the capital city of Iranian dynasties several times during its history. It is located on a large, flat plain, 800 km (500 mi) south-east of Tehran, the capital of Iran.\n\n[5] Kerman County: Kerman County () is a county in Kerman Province in Iran. The capital of the county is Kerman. At the 2006 census, the county's population was 654,052, in 166,740 families. The county is subdivided into six districts (bakhsh): the Central District, Mahan District, Shahdad District, Golbaf District, Rayen District, and Chatrud District. The county has thirteen cities: Kerman, Anduhjerd, Baghin, Chatrud, Ekhtiarabad, Golbaf, Jupar, Kazemabad, Mahan, Mohiabad, Rayen, Shahdad, and Zangiabad. It is the biggest county in the province in terms of area.\n\n[6] Kerman Province: As of 1920, the province was known for the quality of its caraway. Today, Kerman is where a large portion of Iran's auto industry is based. Sirjan, a specially designated economic zone, is considered a passageway for transfer of imported commercial goods from the south (through the Persian Gulf). Arg e Jadid, is another specially designated economic zone of Iran, located in Kerman province.\n\n[7] Kerman Seljuk Sultanate: The government is the first powerful local government in the Kerman and Makran region, which, in addition to political and security stability, could create economic prosperity in the provinces. It was during this period that the Spice Road burgeoned with the flourishing of the ports of Tiz, Hormuz and Kish, and this state, as the highway of this important economic road, could use tremendous wealth with the conditions it had created. Regarding the scientific and social conditions, at this time, with the efforts of the Shahs such as Mohammad Shah II, the scientific and cultural centers were established in Kerman, and with these actions, Kerman, which was away from the main scientific centers, became the center of science in the southeastern region of Iran's plateau. In addition, Kerman and Makran under ruling of Seljuk, grew in agriculture and Animal husbandry, and Progressed in Commerce and trade which led to improved economic and social conditions.\n\n[8] Kerman: Kerman () (, also Romanized as Kermān, Kermun, and Kirman; also known as Carmania) is the capital city of Kerman Province, Iran. At the 2011 census, its population was 821,374, in 221,389 households, making it the 10th most populous city of Iran.\n\n[9] 2003 Bam earthquake: The 2003 Bam earthquake struck the Kerman province of southeastern Iran at 01:56 UTC (5:26 AM Iran Standard Time) on December 26. The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (\"Violent\"). The earthquake was particularly destructive in Bam, with the death toll amounting to at least 26,271 people and injuring up to 30,000. The effects of the earthquake were exacerbated by the use of mud brick as the standard construction medium; many of the area's structures did not comply with earthquake regulations set in 1989.\n\n[10] Arslan Shah I: Arslan Shah I was Sultan of Kerman (1101–1142), a city in Iran situated at the center of Kerman province.

New Sweden was founded in the valley of the Delaware River in 1638, and Sweden later laid claim to a number of Caribbean islands. A string of Swedish forts and trading posts was constructed along the coast of West Africa as well, but these were not designed for Swedish settlers.\n\n[2] Anti-Russian sentiment: The Russian state is said to have been organized in the 9th century AD at Novgorod by Rurik, supposedly coming from Sweden. In the 13th century, Stockholm was founded to stop foreign navies from invading lake Mälaren. Both events are signs that hostile naval missions across the Baltic Sea go a long way back, temporarily ending with the peace treaty of Nöteborg 1323 between Sweden and the Novgorod Republic (which later became Russia), soon to be broken by another Catholic Swedish crusade into Greek-orthodox Novgorod. Russia has been described as Sweden's \"archenemy\" (a title also given to Denmark). The two countries have often been at war, most intensively during the Great Northern War (1700–1721) and the Finnish War (1808–1809), when Sweden lost that third of its territory to Russia that now is Finland. Sweden defeated a Russian army in the Battle of Narva (1700), but was defeated by Russia in the Battle of Poltava 1709. In 1719 Russian troops burnt most Swedish cities and industrial communities along the Baltic sea coast to the ground (from Norrköping up to Piteå in the north) in what came to be called \"Rysshärjningarna\" (the Russian ravages, a term first recorded in 1730). \"The Russians are coming\" (\"ryssen kommer\") is a traditional Swedish warning call. After the death of king Charles XII in 1718 and the peace in 1721, Swedish politics was do\n\n[3] Karlskrona: The city was founded on 10 August 1680 when the Royal Swedish Navy was relocated from the Stockholm area to the Trossö island which had up until then been used chiefly for farming and grazing. At the time Sweden was the dominant military power in the Baltic sea region, but needed a better strategic location against Denmark, since southern parts of Sweden had been conquered only a few decades before (see the Torstenson War). The Swedish fleet tended to get stuck in the ice during winter while located close to Stockholm and was therefore moved south. The island had a very strategic position with short sailing distances to the German and Baltic provinces. The city name means \"Karl's Crown\" in honour of King Karl XI of Sweden, the name being inspired by the name of the city Landskrona.\n\n[4] Köping: In 1863 the first local government acts were implemented in Sweden. There were two acts, one for cities and one for rural areas. Of the around 2,500 municipalities, 89 had city rights and thus had the right to call themselves \"stad\" (city). Under the \"rural\" act there were also eight localities given the status of \"köping\", which positioned them between a rural municipality and a town (see municipalköping). The number of localities designated as \"köping\" rose dramatically during the 20th century and reached its peak in 1959, when they were 95. Many new settlements during the industrialization of Sweden, as well as some of the suburbs in the metropolitan areas, first received the title of \"köping\" and it was also made part of their name (such as Linköping or Nyköping). They later grew further and received town privileges, but kept the \"köping\" ending of their names. See the list below. It has been found that a vast majority, nearly 70%, of such designated market-towns lie within an area of in south-central Sweden, especially in the highly economically productive region immediately west and south of Stockholm, in Södermanland, Örebro, Östergötland, and Jönköping counties.\n\n[5] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[6] Sweden Democrats: The Sweden Democrats party was founded in 1988 as a direct successor to the Sweden Party, which in turn had been formed in 1986 by the merger of (BSS, in English: \"Keep Sweden Swedish\") and a faction of the Swedish Progress Party. SD claims 6 February 1988 as the date of its foundation, although observers tend to see the party's foundation as part of a complex decade-long series of events, with some even calling into question whether a meeting took place on 6 February. The party has its roots in Swedish fascism and was primarily a white nationalist movement through the early-1990s, when it first began distancing itself from its past. The SD's logo from the 1990s until 2006 was a version of the torch used by the UK National Front.\n\n[7] New Sweden, Maine: Starting in 1870, a Swedish-immigrant colony was established by the State of Maine in Aroostook County. The State of Maine had appointed William W. Thomas, Jr., who had served as American Consul in Sweden during the administration of President Abraham Lincoln, to be State Immigration Commissioner. On March 23, 1870 the Legislature passed an Act authorizing a Board of Immigration and Thomas was named Commissioner of Immigration. Thomas went to Sweden, recruited the first 51 immigrants, and led them into the township that became New Sweden. Early hardships were overcome and the colony prospered and grew into the neighboring townships of Westmanland (1879), Stockholm (1881) and the surrounding areas. New Sweden has maintained many Swedish traditions since its founding, including the celebrations of St. Lucia Day and \"Midsommar.\" Founders Day is also observed on July 23 every year. The Swedish language can sometimes still be heard in the older generation. The New Sweden Folk Dancers typically perform at many of the Swedish celebrations and Swedish foods are known to grace the tables.\n\n[8] Sweden: An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the Black Death in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population, the Hanseatic League threatened Scandinavia's culture, finances and languages. This led to the forming of the Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the Thirty Years War on the Reformist side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the Swedish Empire was formed. This became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th century. Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Norway was militarily forced into personal union. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs. The union with Norway was peacefully dissolved in 1905. Sweden was formally neutral through both world wars and the Cold War, albeit Sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards cooperation with NATO.\n\n[9] Dark earth: In Sweden, dark earth covering has been found in Uppåkra (in southernmost Sweden, former Denmark), where city-like settlement existed from about the year 1 until 1000 C.E. when the settlement shifted to modern day Lund. Dark earth over has been found in the Viking city of Björkö (today called Birka), in central Sweden, close to modern Stockholm. Dark earth has also been found in Köpingsvik, on the island of Öland close to the southern Sweden east coast.\n\n[10] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H. Cockrum, Foram’s founder, chairman and CEO. “We wanted the most efficient office building ever designed, with no wasted space or wasted energy.

A second edition was published by Allen & Unwin in 1996, in which she brought the story of the Tasmanian Aborigines in the 20th century up to date. Her work was later attacked by Keith Windschuttle, thus drawing her into the \"history wars\". Windschuttle pointed to alleged discrepancies between Ryan's claims, her cited sources for the claims, and what the cited sources for the claims and the historical record actually reported. Ryan contested Windschuttle's claims in an essay entitled 'Who is the fabricator?' in Robert Manne's \"Whitewash: On Keith Windschuttle Fabrication of Aboriginal History\" published in 2003 and further addressed them in her book, \"Tasmanian Aborigines: A History Since 1803\", published in 2012.\n\n[2] Keith Windschuttle: Major published items include \"Unemployment\" (1979), which analysed the economic causes and social consequences of unemployment in Australia and advocated a socialist response; \"The Media: a New Analysis of the Press, Television, Radio and Advertising in Australia\" (1984), on the political economy and content of the news and entertainment media; \"The Killing of History\" (1994), a critique of postmodernism in history; \"The Fabrication of Aboriginal History: Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803–1847\" (2002), which accuses a number of Australian historians of falsifying and inventing the degree of violence in the past; \"The White Australia Policy\" (2004), a history of that policy which argues that academic historians have exaggerated the degree of racism in Australian history; and \"The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume Three: The Stolen Generations 1881–2008\", which argues the story of the \"stolen generations\" of Aboriginal children is a myth. He was editor of \"Quadrant\" magazine 2008-2015 when he became Chair of the board and editor-in-chief. He has been the publisher of Macleay Press since 1994.\n\n[3] Keith Windschuttle: With respect to the testing of the claims in court, Windschuttle writes: \"... when they tested specific policies before the Federal Court, and when they argued the general intentions of the parliaments and legislators before the High Court, the historians and political activists who invented the notion of the Stolen Generations proved incapable of substantiating their case. As far as Australia's highest courts are concerned, the central hypothesis of the Stolen Generations is legally extinct\"... \"The only legal cases with any potential credibility would be those made by individuals such as Bruce Trevorrow, who was unlawfully removed from his family and suffered badly as a result\". However in the Trevorrow case, Windschuttle argues that the decision shows \"that the actions of the Aborigines Protection Board in placing Bruce in foster care without his parents' agreement was actually illegal at the time\" and not the result of a policy of removal but rather the illegal actions of welfare officials who believed, rightly or wrongly, that Bruce Trevorrow was neglected and that his health and life would be in danger if they returned him to his mother. The fact that Bruce Trevorrow's siblings were never removed is an indicator that there was no such policy and that welfare officials were not empowered to remove Aboriginal children on racial grounds.\n\n[4] Henry Reynolds (historian): In 2002, historian and journalist, Keith Windschuttle, in his book \"The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803–1847\", disputed whether the colonial settlers of Australia committed widespread genocide against Indigenous Australians, especially focussing on the Black War in Tasmania, and denied the claims by historians such as Reynolds and Professor Lyndall Ryan that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. He accused Reynolds of inventing evidence and making many claims without any documentary support at all. Subsequently, in \"Whitewash: on Keith Windschuttle's fabrication of Aboriginal history\" it was argued that Windschuttle failed to meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' and thus his accusations of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence were flawed.\n\n[5] Keith Windschuttle: In January 2009, Windschuttle was hoaxed into publishing an article in \"Quadrant\". The stated aim of the hoax was to expose Windschuttle's alleged right wing bias by proving he would publish an inaccurate article and not check its footnotes or authenticity if it met his preconceptions. An author using the pseudonym \"biotechnologist Dr Sharon Gould\" submitted an article claiming that CSIRO had planned to produce food crops engineered with human genes. However, \"Gould\" revealed that she had regarded the article as an Alan Sokal style hoax, referring to an instance in which writings described as obvious scientific nonsense were submitted to and accepted by an academic journal. Based on the reporter's intimate knowledge of the hoax and what he described as her \"triumphant\" tone when disclosing the hoax to him, Windschuttle accused the online publication \"Crikey\" of being involved in the hoax, a claim \"Crikey\" denied. Two days later, Crikey revealed that \"Gould\" was in fact the writer, editor and activist Katherine Wilson. Wilson agreed to being named by \"Crikey\", as her name had already appeared in online speculation and it seemed likely that her identity was about to be revealed by other journalists.\n\n[6] Keith Windschuttle: In the wake of the 2011 Norway attacks, Windschuttle did not deny that the perpetrator, Anders Behring Breivik, had read and praised statements he had made at a symposium in New Zealand in 2006, but stressed that he was \"still at a complete loss to find any connection between them and the disgusting and cowardly actions of Breivik\". Windschuttle went on to add that \"it would be a 'disturbing accusation' if people thought that he had ever used deliberately provocative language that might have caused Breivik to take up a rifle and shoot unarmed teenagers in cold blood\".\n\n[7] Robert Manne: Among Manne's other books are \"The New Conservatism in Australia\" (1982), \"In Denial: The Stolen Generations and the Right\" (2001), and \"Do Not Disturb\" (2005). He edited the 2003 anthology, \"Whitewash: On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History\", as a rebuttal to Keith Windschuttle's claims disputing there was genocide against Indigenous Australians and guerrilla warfare against British settlement on the continent. Contributors included Henry A. Reynolds, who writes on frontier conflict; and Lyndall Ryan, whose book \"The Aboriginal Tasmanians\" is one of the main targets of Windschuttle's work.\n\n[8] Keith Windschuttle: Within a year Windschuttle's claims and research produced a volume of rebuttal, namely \"Whitewash. On Keith Windschuttle's Fabrication of Aboriginal History\", an anthology edited and introduced by Robert Manne, professor of politics at La Trobe University, with contributions by Australian academics from a range of disciplines. Manne, who called the book \"one of the most implausible, ignorant and pitiless books about Australian history written for many years\", himself summed up the case against Windschuttle, noting that Windschuttle's evidence for Aboriginal deaths is derived from a scholar, Plomley, who denied that any estimate for them could be made from the documentary record; that a scrupulous conservative scholar, H. A. Willis, using exactly the same sources as Windschuttle, came up with a figure of 188 violent deaths, and another 145 rumoured deaths; that Windschuttle's method excludes deaths of Aborigines who were wounded, and later died; that all surviving Aborigines transported by Robinson to Flinders' Island bore marks of violence and gunshot wounds \"perpetrated on them by depraved whites\"; that Windschuttle cannot deny that between 1803 and 1834 almost all Tasmanian Aborigines died, and the only evidence for disease as a factor before 1829 rests on a single conversation recorded by James Bonwick, and that Ab\n\n[9] Keith Windschuttle: James Boyce, a Tasmanian historian, dismisses Windschuttle's argument as \"uninformed slander\" based on a failure to read the only documentary sources that matter, the journals of French and British explorers recording the first contacts with Tasmanian aborigines before the colonial period. Examining Windschuttle's use of sources for the view women were treated like slaves and drudges, he says Windschuttle relies on a selective reading of just two of many sources in an early work by Ling Roth, \"written at the height of Social Darwinist orthodoxy\" (1899). However, Ling Roth did not \"write\" these sources; he simply translated the diaries of the first contacts by the French explorers. One is from Péron, who noted scars on women, and interpreted them as signs of domestic violence, which however he had never witnessed. Other early observers took this scarring as an indigenous cultural practice. James Cook had noticed Aboriginal men and women's bodies were both incised with scars in the same manner. Péron was less sympathetic than other first observers on the Baudin expedition to Australia. Boyce argues that their observations, including those of the captain Nicolas Baudin, do not support Windschuttle's claims. Even Péron records an encounter at Port Cygnet with an Aboriginal group of men and women, who shared a meal of abalone with\n\n[10] Freddie Timms: In 2002, a controversy that came to involve Timms developed when writer Keith Windschuttle argued that claims made by some historians about the killing of indigenous people by white landholders were false. Windschuttle's arguments were part of a broader debate about Australian indigenous historiography and conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. One argument put in this debate was that some authors, including Windschuttle, were privileging written history (which was at that time invariably recorded by white Australians) over oral histories of indigenous people. These oral histories included accounts of a massacre of indigenous people (including members of Timms' family) at a place called Mistake Creek. Angered by Windschuttle and others' claims, Timms and several other artists including Paddy Bedford created paintings documenting the events recorded in their oral histories. These paintings were exhibited in \"Blood on the spinifex\" at the Ian Potter Museum of Art in 2003.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following questions:\n\n1.

In a speech from the terrace of the hotel, Obama said that \"the Taj has been the symbol of the strength and the resilience of the Indian people.\"\n\n[2] Taj corridor case: The Taj Heritage Corridor case is an alleged scam wherein 2002–2003, the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Mayawati and a minister in her government, Nasimuddin Siddiqui, were charged with corruption. The Taj Corridor project was intended to upgrade tourist facilities near the Taj Mahal and was to be implemented during her tenure as Chief Minister. The then BJP government at the Centre gave the Environmental Clearance required for the project near Taj Mahal. However, later on the BJP backed out and then started saying that the project was not cleared by the Environment Ministry and blamed Mayawati for starting construction work near the Taj Mahal.\n\n[3] Administration Building (Randolph Air Force Base): The building was nicknamed the Taj Mahal in its early years, due to what some thought was an architectural similarity to the Taj Mahal in India, and is commonly referred to as \"the Taj\". It has been featured in movies such as \"West Point of the Air\", \"Air Cadet\" and \"I Wanted Wings\". A detailed replica of the Taj has sometimes been shown at military conventions. Carved from a block of wood in 1984 by base military retirees, the replica has a working electrical light beacon.\n\n[4] The Ruins (mansion): Known variously as the \"Taj Mahal of Talisay\", \"Taj Mahal of Negros\" and \"Taj Mahal of the Philippines\", it is in the private ownership of the great-grandchildren of Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson and Cora Maria Osorio Rosa-Braga. They have preserved it in its ruined state, amidst operational farmland, as a tourist attraction that can be visited for a fee or hired for events. It is open to daily visitors from 8am to 8pm for a small entrance fee of PHP100 adults, PHP 50 students and PHP20 children.\n\n[5] The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel: Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was specifically chosen by Lashkar-e-Taiba for an attack so that it will be \"striking a blow against a symbol of Indian wealth and progress\". The hotel was attacked on 26 November 2008, during which material damage occurred, including the destruction of the hotel's roof in the hours following. Hostages were taken during the attacks, and at least 167 people were killed, including many foreigners. The casualties were mostly Indian citizens, although westerners carrying foreign passports were singled out. Indian commandos killed the gunmen barricaded in the hotel, to end the three-day battle on 29 November. At least 31 died at the Taj. Approximately 450 people were staying in the Taj Mahal Palace and Hotel at the time of the seizure. The attack was planned using information compiled by David Headley, a Pakistani-American, who had stayed at the hotel multiple times.\n\n[6] Taj Mahal (2015 film): The French film Taj Mahal is about The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel in Mumbai near the Gateway of India. It was one of the sites of the 26/11 Terrorist Attacks in Mumbai 2008. There are various Documentaries and Films made on the 26/11 Mumbai Terrorist Attack. The movie of Ram Gopal Verma The Attacks of 26/11 which was also based on the Mumbai Attacks was released on 1 March 2013 in India. This Movie is Made by Frenchman Nicolas Saada, Which was Released in venice Film Festival 2015. It tells the story of a teenager, played by Stacy Martin, who has come to Mumbai with her Parents & is staying at the Taj Hotel. She is trapped when the terrorists attack the hotel and her parents are out for dinner.\n\n[7] Mughal gardens: Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, marks the apex of Mughal garden architecture and floral design. He is famous for the construction of the Taj Mahal, a sprawling funereal paradise in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. He is also responsible for the Red Fort at Delhi which contains the Mahtab Bagh, a night garden that was filled with night-blooming jasmine and other pale flowers. The pavilions within are faced with white marble to glow in the moonlight. This and the marble of the Taj Mahal are inlaid with semiprecious stone depicting scrolling naturalistic floral motifs, the most important being the tulip, which Shah Jahan adopted as a personal symbol.\n\n[8] Origins and architecture of the Taj Mahal: We do not know precisely who designed the Taj Mahal. In the Islamic world at the time, the credit for a building's design was usually given to its patron rather than its architects. From the evidence of contemporary sources, it is clear that a team of architects were responsible for the design and supervision of the works, but they are mentioned infrequently. Shah Jahan's court histories emphasise his personal involvement in the construction and it is true that, more than any other Mughal emperor, he showed the greatest interest in building, holding daily meetings with his architects and supervisors. The court chronicler Lahouri, writes that Jahan would make \"appropriate alterations to whatever the skillful architects designed after many thoughts, and asked competent questions.\" Two architects \"are\" mentioned by name, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri and Mir Abd-ul Karim in writings by Lahauri's son Lutfullah Muhandis. Ustad Ahmad Lahauri had laid the foundations of the Red Fort at Delhi. Mir Abd-ul Karim had been the favourite architect of the previous emperor Jahangir and is mentioned as a supervisor, together with Makramat Khan, of the construction of the Taj Mahal.In the complex, passages from the Qur'an are used as decorative elements. Recent scholarship suggests that the passages were chosen by a Persian calligrapher Abd ul-Haq, who came to India from Shiraz, Iran, in 1609. As a reward for his \"\n\n[9] P. N. Oak: Oak says that well-known western authorities on architecture including Ernest Binfield Havell, Mrs. Kenoyer and William Wilson Hunter have written that the Taj Mahal is built in the Hindu temple style, asserting that Havel says the plan of the ancient Hindu temple of Java, the Prambanan, is identical with that of the Taj Mahal. Also, he argues out that the octagonal shape of the Taj Mahal has a special Hindu significance, because Hindus alone have special names for the eight directions and the celestial guards assigned to them. He argues that the finial of the Taj Mahal is a trishula with a Kalasha, holding two bent mango leaves and a coconut, which is a sacred Hindu motif.\n\n[10] The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel: Hillary Clinton visited Mumbai in July 2009, aiming to deepen India – United States relations and stayed at the Taj hotel; she also attended a commemoration event. \"I wanted to send a message that I personally and our country is in sympathy and solidarity with the employees and the guests of the Taj who lost their lives ... with the people of Mumbai.\" On 15 August 2010, India's Independence Day, the Taj Mahal Palace was reopened after restoration. The cost of the restoration of the hotel so far has been 1.75 billion rupees. The palace wing has been restored and offers new hotel services.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the given contexts:\n\nWho is responsible for maintaining the Taj Mahal?\n\nPlease select one of the following options:\n\nA) The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel\nB", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

He is best remembered as father of two British prime ministers (Henry Pelham and the Duke of Newcastle) who, between them, served for 18 years as first minister. Pelham was born in Laughton, Sussex, the son of Sir John Pelham, 3rd Baronet and his wife Lucy Sidney (daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester). Pelham was educated at Tonbridge School and Christ Church, Oxford. He sat for East Grinstead from October 1678 until August 1679. In October 1679 he was returned for Lewes, serving until 1702 (when he was returned for both Lewes and Sussex); he subsequently chose to sit for Sussex, a seat he held until 1705.\n\n[2] Charles Stanford (minister): Stanford, son of Joseph Stanford, shoemaker (d. 1862), was born at Green Lane, Northampton, on 9 March 1823. He was for some time a shoemaker, then a lawyer's clerk, and afterwards a bookseller's assistant. In 1839, at the age of sixteen, he commenced preaching, and in October 1841 entered the Bristol Baptist College. His first pastorate was at Sparrow Hill, Loughborough, where he stayed from 1845 to Christmas 1846. On 7 March 1847 he became minister of the United Presbyterian and Baptist Church at Devizes, Wiltshire, where his congregation gradually increased, and where he on 9 April 1852 opened a new chapel. In May 1858 he was elected co-pastor with Dr Edward Steane of Denmark Place Chapel, Camberwell, Surrey; and in May 1861, on the retirement of Steane, received the full charge. He remained at Camberwell till his death. In 1860 he visited Taunton, where, and in the neighbourhood, he collected information for his work \"J. Alleine, his Companions and his Times\", published in 1861.\n\n[3] Streatham Library: Streatham Library is located at 63 Streatham High Road, Streatham, in the London Borough of Lambeth, England. The Library opened in 1890, and is one of several historical libraries in the vicinity which were built by Henry Tate. It is a public library.\n\n[4] Streatham: After the First World War Streatham developed as a location for entertainment, with Streatham Hill Theatre (now a bingo hall), three cinemas, the Locarno ballroom (latterly Caesar's nightclub, which closed in 2010) and Streatham Ice Rink all adding to its reputation as \"the West End of South London\". With the advent of electric tram services it also grew as a shopping centre serving a wide area to the south. In the 1930s large numbers of blocks of flats were constructed along the High Road. These speculative developments were not initially successful. They were only filled when émigré communities began to arrive in London after leaving countries under the domination of Hitler's Germany. In 1932 the parish church of the Holy Redeemer was built in Streatham Vale to commemorate the work of William Wilberforce.\n\n[5] Streatham Park Cemetery: Streatham Park Cemetery (also known as South London Crematorium and Streatham Vale Cemetery) is a cemetery and crematorium on Rowan Road in Streatham Vale which is managed by Lambeth London Borough Council. The South London Crematorium is situated within the cemetery grounds and opened in 1936.\n\n[6] London Borough of Lambeth: The Basaveshwara statue at the Albert Embankment erected by the Former Mayor of Lambeth Cllr Dr Neeraj Patil was unveiled by Prime Minister of India on 14 November 2015.Since 2002, Lambeth Borough Council has had 63 members elected in 21 three-member wards by means of a plurality bloc voting system. The wards are Bishop's, Brixton Hill, Clapham Common, Clapham Town, Coldharbour, Ferndale, Gipsy Hill, Herne Hill, Knight's Hill, Larkhall, Oval, Prince's, St Leonard's, Stockwell, Streatham Hill, Streatham South, Streatham Wells, Thornton, Thurlow Park, Tulse Hill and Vassall.\n\n[7] London Borough of Lambeth: In the northern part of the borough are the central London districts of the South Bank, Vauxhall and Lambeth; in the south are the suburbs of Gipsy Hill, Streatham, West Dulwich and West Norwood. In between are the developed and inner-city districts of Brixton, Brixton Hill, Streatham Hill, Clapham, Clapham Park, Herne Hill, Stockwell, Tulse Hill and Kennington, which are each at different stages of gentrification and have suburban and urban elements. Vauxhall and South Lambeth are central districts in the process of redevelopment with high-density business and residential property. Streatham is between suburban London and inner-city Brixton, with the suburban and developed areas of Streatham, Streatham Hill and Streatham Vale.\n\n[8] Streatham Library: Tate was made a baronet in 1898, the year before his death. He lived at Park Hill by Streatham Common, south London. He married a second time after moving to London in 1881, and his wife, being born locally, influenced Tate in benefacting libraries in the local area. He is buried in nearby West Norwood Cemetery, the gates of which are located opposite a public library that he endowed. Park Hill became a nunnery after his death until refurbishment as housing around 2004.\n\n[9] Streatham: In August 2011, Streatham was selected as one of the areas to benefit from Round 1 of the Mayor of London's \"Outer London Fund\", gaining £300,000. Later, Streatham was awarded a further £1.6 million, matched by another £1 million by Lambeth. The money from this fund was spent on improving streets and public spaces in Streatham. This includes the smartening up of shop fronts through painting and cleaning, replacing shutters and signage as well as helping to reveal facilities behind the high street such as The Stables Community Centre. Streatham Library has also undergone a £1.2 million refurbishment. The Tudor Hall behind the library was brought back into public use as \"The Mark Bennett Centre\" providing a meeting and performance space. The central reservation along the A23 is being removed, which involves some repaving and resurfacing, planting of new trees, and the creation of an enlarged bus and cycle lane. Streatham Skyline introduced new lighting to highlight some of Streatham's more attractive buildings and monuments with the aim of improving safety and the overall attractiveness of the area.\n\n[10] Henry Robertson Bowers: Bowers was born on 29 July 1883 in Greenock, of Scottish descent. After his father died in Rangoon, his mother alone raised him from the age of three with his two older sisters. By January 1896, the family had moved to Streatham, in South London, and lived at 19 Pathfield Road, where Mrs Bowers was still residing in 1899. Whilst living in Streatham, Bowers attended Streatham High School for Boys in Pinfold Road in 1896-7. The building survives today as the Computer Centre behind Streatham Library, on which a plaque was placed by The Streatham Society on 29 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary of his death.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nWhich minister was born in Streatham, London?\n\nPlease respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Payton, an African American woman, appeared with Connie Bea Hope, a white woman, on the show starting in 1956. In the early years, Payton did not appear on camera unless her hands slipped into the shot while setting up or removing utensils. Later, in the 1960s, Payton began to appear on air and she eventually received third billing on the program's opening titles, was given her own microphone, and offered comments on Hope's demonstrations. The two women were known in the station for their usually good-natured backstage squabbles.\n\n[2] Jo Marie Payton: Jo Marie Payton was born on August 3, 1950, in Albany, Georgia. Sometime during her early teens, her family relocated to Opa-locka, Florida. Payton attended high school at North Dade Jr./ Sr. High School and later graduated from Miami Carol City Senior High School in 1968. Payton graduated from Albany State University. Payton's big break came when she was cast as Harriet Winslow, the elevator operator on the ABC sitcom \"'Perfect Strangers\" in 1987. Her performance was so well received by audiences that she was given her own sitcom, \"Family Matters\", in 1989. Continuing her character Harriette Winslow from \"Perfect Strangers\", she played a mother in an African-American middle-class family living in Chicago, Illinois. Payton left \"Family Matters\" partway through its final season, appearing for the last time on December 19, 1997. Payton's character was played by Judyann Elder in the show's remaining eight episodes. In 2002, Payton appeared on the \"TV Moms\" episode of the Anne Robinson version of \"The Weakest Link\", and was the third one voted off. In 2003, Payton and her daughter appeared on a Mother's Day episode of \"Lingo\", playing against fellow TV mom Meredith Baxter and her daughter. Baxter and her daughter won. In 2005, Jo Marie Payton provided the voice of Suga Mama in \"The Proud Family Movie\". Her other television credits include \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Reba\", \"Girlfriends\", \"\n\n[3] Gary Payton: Many attribute his success to the tremendous work ethic and ability to play through injury he displayed throughout his career. In his 17-year career, Payton missed only 25 games, and at one point held the longest active streak for consecutive games played, with over 300. \"The Sporting News\" noted in a 2000 article, \"Durability always has been one of Payton's strong suits. He has missed only two games in 10 seasons and is generally counted on for nearly a full game's worth of nonstop motion, despite chronic back pain that requires extensive stretching and regular applications of heating packs.\" Karl Malone was the only player to log more minutes of playing time than Payton in the 1990s. \"Sports Illustrated\" labeled Payton's 2003–04 season as the best season ever by a point guard aged 35 or older, with the exception of John Stockton's later years, and Payton continued to play at a high level even as he advanced in age.\n\n[4] Walter Payton: Walter Jerry Payton (July 25, 1954 – November 1, 1999) was an American football running back who played for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) for thirteen seasons. Payton was known around the NFL as \"Sweetness\". A nine-time Pro Bowl selectee, Payton is remembered as a prolific rusher, once holding records for career rushing yards, touchdowns, carries, yards from scrimmage, all-purpose yards, and many other categories. He was also versatile, and retired with the most receptions by a non-receiver, and had eight career touchdown passes. He was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1993 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996. Hall of Fame NFL player and coach Mike Ditka described Payton as the greatest football player he had ever seen—but even greater as a human being.\n\n[5] Mark Payton: Payton was first drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 31st round of the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft out of St. Rita of Cascia High School in Chicago, Illinois. He did not sign with the Twins and went on to play college baseball at the University of Texas at Austin for the Longhorns. While at Texas, he had a Big-12 record 101 straight games getting on base. After his junior season he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 16th round of the 2013 MLB Draft, but did not sign and returned to Texas for his senior season. Payton played in 234 games during his four-year college career, batting .318/.425/.444 with seven home runs\n\n[6] Gary Payton: On September 22, 2005, he signed a one-year $1.1 million contract with Miami, reuniting with Walker (who was acquired seven weeks earlier by the Heat), as well as former Lakers' teammate Shaquille O'Neal. Serving as a backup to Jason Williams, Payton averaged 7.7 points and started 25 of 81 games. In the playoffs, Payton did not start but averaged 24.3 minutes a game after averaging 28.5 minutes during the regular season, often playing during pressure situations in the 4th quarter of games. In game 4 of the semifinals against the New Jersey Nets, Payton hit a critical three-pointer with 56 seconds left in the game to clinch the Heat victory. In game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on the road against the Detroit Pistons, Payton scored 14 points on 6 of 8 shooting, helping the Heat set the tone in the series. Miami won the series in 6 games to reach the team's first ever Finals against the Dallas Mavericks. Miami lost the first two games in Dallas and trailed in the final quarter of game 3 before a comeback led by Dwyane Wade culminated with a Jason Williams pass to Payton, who faked his defender and hit the game-winning jump-shot to keep Miami from falling 3–0 in the series. In game 5, Payton scored 8 points, including Miami's final field goal with 29 seconds left, to help clinch a one-point victory. The Heat returned to Dallas for game 6 and won 95\n\n[7] Mother's Day (Law &amp; Order): The jury finds Diane Payton guilty of second-degree murder, but the jury foreperson asks if any jail time is necessary. Law and Order is considered by some 'the best drama on network television.' Since first featuring in 1999, the franchise had produced hundreds of episodes and multiple seasons. Despite this critics are sceptical of these 'spinoff' style that is often 'missing a spark.' Generally speaking the episode was received well and was later released in France, Germany, Netherlands and Japan.\n\n[8] Walter Payton: Payton performed with his teammates in the widely released 1985 music video \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\". The Bears went on to a 15–1 record that culminated in a 46–10 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. Although Payton's offensive prowess had assisted the Bears throughout the 1985 season, he did not score any touchdowns in the postseason and the New England Patriots prevented him from reaching the end zone in the Super Bowl. According to quarterback Jim McMahon, he was targeted by two or three defenders on every play, and others stated that Payton's mere presence allowed others to shine, given that at least 2 people were targeting Payton on every play. In a later interview, Ditka stated that one of his major regrets was Payton's lack of a touchdown in the Super Bowl.\n\n[9] Elfrid Payton (basketball): On July 9, 2018, Payton signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. In his debut for the Pelicans in their season opener on October 17, 2018, Payton recorded 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 131–112 win over the Houston Rockets. Payton's minimalist triple-double made him the first player to record exactly 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a single game since March 2, 2013, when Kyle Lowry did it for Toronto. It was Payton's 11th career triple-double. On November 16, against the New York Knicks, Payton returned to the lineup after missing nine games with a sprained right ankle, only to fracture a finger in his left hand after eight minutes on the court. He was subsequently ruled out for approximately six weeks. He returned to action on December 31 against the Minnesota Timberwolves after a 22-game absence. In his second game back on January 2, he scored 25 points in a 126–121 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n[10] List of Bones characters: FBI Special Agent Payton Perotta (season 4) is an FBI agent who appeared in three episodes beginning with \"Fire in the Ice\". She filled in for Booth as liaison with the Jeffersonian team when Booth was a murder suspect and when he was incapacitated by a back injury. She also encountered the Jeffersonian team when Booth was kidnapped by the Gravedigger. Although Perotta's presence was specifically requested when Booth was off with his back trouble, Brennan stated that this was simply because it was easier to work with somebody who already knew how they worked rather than any appreciation for Perotta as an Agent. While competent, she lacked the bond with the Jeffersonian team that Booth had developed—when she commented that \"her\" people had found potentially important evidence for the current case, Hodgins and Wendell, speaking in unison, informed her that they were \"Booth's\" people.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nYes, answer is present.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nNo", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Murray held serve at this key juncture, and the first set stayed on serve until the tenth game. During that crucial game, they were embroiled in a 39-shot tussle, which gave the relieved Serb a break point. Djokovic took the break of serve on the subsequent point, and captured the first set in a hard-fought 59 minutes. Djokovic quickly overcame the Briton in the second set to take a five-games-to-none advantage, which allowed him to take the set, only losing two games. Djokovic went on to win the third set, which allowed him to capture his second Australian Open title.\n\n[2] 2013 Novak Djokovic tennis season: Novak Djokovic began the 2013 season in Australia. Alongside Ana Ivanovic, he represented Serbia at the 2013 Hopman Cup, where he played four singles and four mixed doubles matches. The Serbian duo finished runner-up, losing 1–2 to Spanish duo Anabel Medina Garrigues and Fernando Verdasco in the final. Two weeks later Djokovic took part in the first competitive tournament of the year – 2013 Australian Open as the two-time defending champion. On the road to the final Novak defeated Stanislas Wawrinka in an epic five-hour meeting that finished 12–10 in the decisive set. Along the way, he defeated two Top 10 players – Tomáš Berdych and David Ferrer. In the final he met the No. 3 seed Andy Murray, whom he defeated in four sets to take his third straight title at Melbourne Park, the first man in the open era to do so.\n\n[3] Novak Djokovic: Djokovic made his first Grand Slam tournament appearance by qualifying for the 2005 Australian Open, where he was defeated by eventual champion Marat Safin in the first round in straight sets, after defeating future rival Stanislas Wawrinka in qualifying. However, he went on to reach the third round of both Wimbledon and the US Open, coming back from two sets down to defeat Guillermo García-López in the former, and beating Gaël Monfils and Mario Ančić in the latter. Djokovic participated in four Masters events and qualified for two of them, his best performance coming in Paris, where he reached the third round and defeated fourth seed Mariano Puerta along the way.\n\n[4] 2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season: Djokovic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the fifth consecutive year. Novak was drawn into group A alongside Tomáš Berdych, David Ferrer and Andy Murray. He beat Berdych, lost to Ferrer in straights and then lost to replacement player Janko Tipsarević, who substituted Murray. With a 1–2 record in the round-robin stage he was eliminated from the tournament.\n\n[5] Novak Djokovic: In the semi-finals of the 2011 Davis Cup, Djokovic played a crucial rubber match for Serbia against Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, where he retired while trailing, after reaggravating a back injury sustained during the US Open tournament. This secured Argentina's place in the final. This marked Djokovic's third loss of his 2011 season, and his second retirement.\n\n[6] 2018 Novak Djokovic tennis season: Djokovic played his first official match since Wimbledon at the Australian Open. After defeating Donald Young in straight sets, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the second round after dropping the first set, with Monfils succumbing to extreme heat in the latter stages of the match. With a victory over Albert Ramos Viñolas in third round where he played Korean Chung Hyeon. In a match of constant breaks of serve, Djokovic eventually lost in straight sets due to relentless backcourt defense from Chung and copious unforced errors on critical points. After his loss, Djokovic decided to undergo a surgery on his right elbow, which he claimed was affecting him from previous two years.\n\n[7] 2017 US Open – Men's Singles: Novak Djokovic withdrew due to an elbow injury that ended his tennis season, ending his streak of 51 consecutive grand slam appearances, dating back to the 2005 Australian Open. Accordingly, this was the first men's singles draw at the US Open since 1971 to include neither finalist from the previous year's tournament. The withdrawals of Wawrinka and Djokovic, along with those of Andy Murray, Kei Nishikori (also ending his season), and Milos Raonic, meant that only 6 of the top 11 ranked players competed in the tournament. The draw was retrospectively adjusted after Murray's late withdrawal, but the timing of the withdrawal meant that Nadal and Federer remained in the same half of the draw. This meant it was the first Grand Slam since 2004 that did not feature Wawrinka, Djokovic and Murray in the tournament.\n\n[8] 2016 Novak Djokovic tennis season: Djokovic started tournament with a tough match against the American Bjorn Fratangelo. The Serb rallied back from a set down to win in three sets. In the next round Novak Djokovic beat Philipp Kohlschreiber in straight sets. The four-time Indian Wells Masters champion is successfully continuing his title-defending journey with a win over Feliciano Lopez in the fourth round, in an hour and 7 minutes. In the quarterfinals Djokovic overcame Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in 2 hours and 6 minutes to set up a blockbuster semifinal at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. Djokovic continued his winning streak against Rafael Nadal beating him in straight sets to reach the 6th 2016 BNP Paribas Open final for the third straight year in a row. He has now beaten the Spaniard six times in a row, with his last loss coming in the 2014 French Open final. Djokovic has now lifted his record over Nadal to 25–23 (only 2nd (first Boris Becker) man in Open Era to beat one rival 25 times). He has reached 10 straight ATP Masters 1000 finals (DNP 2015 Mutua Madrid Open) since 2014 BNP Paribas Masters, winning 8 titles (50–2 record). In the final Novak Djokovic destroyed Milos Raonic during the 77-minute match, to win his third straight and a record fifth Indian Wells Masters title. Djokovic commits four total unforced errors, rolls to most overwhelming win in ATP Masters 1000 final ever. He now has a\n\n[9] Novak Djokovic: In January, Djokovic defended his title in Doha defeating new world No. 1 Andy Murray in three sets. At the 2017 Australian Open, he was upset in the second round by No. 117 Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan. This was the first time since 2007 that Djokovic had failed to reach the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, and the first time ever in his career that he had lost to a player ranked outside of the top 100 in a Grand Slam tournament. In February and March, Djokovic played at the Mexican Open and the Indian Well Masters, but in both events was eliminated by Nick Kyrgios, in the third and fourth rounds, respectively. In April, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to David Goffin. After the tournament, he decided to split with his long-time coach Marián Vajda, fitness specialist Gebhard Phil-Gritsch and physioterapeut Miljan Amanović, citing the need to find a winning spark. A better showing at the Madrid Masters saw Djokovic reach the semi-finals, losing to Nadal in straight sets. A runner-up result at the Rome Masters indicated solid improvements in his form.\n\n[10] Radek Štěpánek: In 2008, he achieved some good results such as reaching the final in San Jose, but losing to Andy Roddick. He also made it to the semifinals in the Rome Masters, losing to Novak Djokovic after he retired due to heat exhaustion. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, he lost to Michaël Llodra in the first round in three sets. Štěpánek finished the season ranked no. 27, but attended the year-end Masters Cup as an alternate. He was vacationing in Thailand and so was able to come to the tournament held in Shanghai without delay. Since he did not have his own tennis gear which got stuck in customs (they were sent from home), he had to borrow a racquet from Novak Djokovic and socks from Andy Murray. After Andy Roddick pulled out due to injury before his second match, Štěpánek entered the tournament with two round-robin ties to play against Roger Federer and Gilles Simon. He gave the second seed Federer a tough match, but lost. He was beaten comprehensively by Simon.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.\n\nPlease let me know when you are ready to proceed with the next question.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the name of the school in Sex Education?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Sex education: Sex education may be taught informally, such as when someone receives information from a conversation with a parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person what he or she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.\n\n[2] Sex education: Leepson sees sex education as instruction in various physiological, psychological and sociological aspects of sexual response and reproduction. Kearney (2008) also defined sex education as \"involving a comprehensive course of action by the school, calculated to bring about the socially desirable attitudes, practices and personal conduct on the part of children and adults, that will best protect the individual as a human and the family as a social institution.\" Thus, sex education may also be described as \"sexuality education\", which means that it encompasses education about all aspects of sexuality, including information about family planning, reproduction (fertilization, conception and development of the embryo and fetus, through to childbirth), plus information about all aspects of one's sexuality including: body image, sexual orientation, sexual pleasure, values, decision making, communication, dating, relationships, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and how to avoid them, and birth control methods. Various aspects of sex education are considered appropriate in school depending on the age of the students or what the children can comprehend at a particular point in time. Rubin and Kindendall expressed that sex education is not merely the topics of reproduction and teaching how babies are conceived and born. Instead, it has a far richer scope and goal of helping children incorporate sex more meaningfully into their present and future life and to provide them with some basic understanding of virtually every aspect of sex by the time they reach full maturity.\n\n[3] Sex education in the United States: Sex education is still a debate in the United States to this day. Some parents believe that their children's school programs encourage sexual activity, and the schools believe that there are many students that don't get any sex education at home. The goal for the parents is for their children to follow their family values. Parents want the ability to teach their children what they want about sex education rather than school programs teaching them of things that certain things that parents are trying to avoid. Sex education programs in schools are mainly trying to give the students a complete picture about sex and sexuality. They want students to know their bodies as well as know how to protect them and make smart decisions. In a study titled \"Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to reduce Teen Pregnancy\" showed that sex education programs in schools are having a huge impact on teen's decisions to remain abstinent or to use contraceptives if they do choose to have intercourse (1). School programs are teaching students everything they need to know about sex and sexuality and that is helping these same students to make their own decisions and to be safe no matter what they choose to do. Successful sex education programs are stated as those that tailor the curricula to students specific needs, address peer pressure and ways to respond to it, and discuss content in a way that is appropriate for students' age groups and level of sexual experience, all while providing accurate information.\n\n[4] Human sexuality: The age and manner in which children are informed of issues of sexuality is a matter of sex education. The school systems in almost all developed countries have some form of sex education, but the nature of the issues covered varies widely. In some countries, such as Australia and much of Europe, age-appropriate sex education often begins in pre-school, whereas other countries leave sex education to the pre-teenage and teenage years. Sex education covers a range of topics, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of sexual behavior. Geographic location also plays a role in society's opinion of the appropriate age for children to learn about sexuality. According to \"TIME\" magazine and CNN, 74% of teenagers in the United States reported that their major sources of sexual information were their peers and the media, compared to 10% who named their parents or a sex education course.\n\n[5] Sex education in the United States: Sex education programs in the United States teach students about sexual health as well as ways to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted teenage pregnancy. The three main types of programs are abstinence-only, abstinence-plus, and comprehensive sex education. Although sex education programs that only promotes abstinence are very prominent in American public schools, comprehensive sex education is known to be the most effective and is proven to have helped young people make better decisions. Sex education has many benefits as it educates students about the human anatomy and teaches the importance of having healthy relationships. Adequate sex education programs in public schools greatly benefit students and have the potential to reduce the high percentages of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies in America.\n\n[6] Sex and Relationships Education: On 1 March 2017 the UK Minister for Education Justine Greening MP released a statement that in the UK that the term Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) would be changed to Relationship and Sex Education (RSE). Sex and Relationship Education is designed to equip children and young people with the information, skills and values to have safe, fulfilling and enjoyable relationships and to take responsibility for their sexual health and well-being. The private areas of the body and the scientific names for body parts are taught to some as young as age four.\n\n[7] Sex education: Wilhelm Reich commented that sex education of his time was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing excitement-arousal, which is what a pubescent individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he believed to be a basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses. Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom. The problem of pregnancy in adolescents is delicate and difficult to assess using sex education. But Calderone believed otherwise, stating that the answer to adolescents' sexual woes and pregnancy can not lie primarily in school programmes which at best can only be remedial; what is needed is prevention education and as such parents should be involved.\n\n[8] Sex education in the United States: Most adolescents in the United States receive some form of sex education at school at least once between grades 6 and 12; many schools begin addressing some topics as early as grades 4 or 5. Academic and other proponents of the National Sexuality Education Standards advocate that by the end of the fifth grade, students should be able to \"Define sexual orientation as the romantic attraction of an individual to someone of the same gender or a different gender.\" However, what students learn varies widely, because curriculum decisions are so decentralized. Many states have laws governing what is taught in sex education classes or allowing parents to opt out. Some state laws leave curriculum decisions to individual school districts.\n\n[9] Sex education: In the Slovak republic the content of sex education varies from school to school, most frequently as a segment of a larger lesson plan of a subject akin to \"Nature science\" in English (this course covers both biology and petrology). Generally the sex ed content taught in Slovakia is quite basic, sometimes lacking, though exactly what any given lesson contains varies among schools and is dependent on the teacher's knowledge of the subject. It is not uncommon for teachers to rely on students asking questions (as opposed to documentaries, discussions, textbooks and in-class debates). Classes are usually divided into boys and girls. Boys are taught the basics of sex, usually limited to dialogue between student and teacher of annotated diagrams of genitalia; while girls are additionally taught about menstruation and pregnancy.\n\n[10] Single-sex education: Single-sex education, also known as single-gender education and gender-isolated education, is the practice of conducting education with male and female students attending separate classes, perhaps in separate buildings or schools. The practice was common before the 20th century, particularly in secondary and higher education. Single-sex education in many cultures is advocated on the basis of tradition as well as religion, and is practiced in many parts of the world. Recently, there has been a surge of interest and establishment of single-sex schools due to educational research. Single-sex education is practiced in many Muslim majority countries; while in the West it is most popular in Chile, Israel, South Korea, and English-speaking countries such as Singapore, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Australia. In the Western world, single sex education is primarily associated with the private sector, with the public (state) sector being overwhelmingly mixed sex; while in the Muslim world the situation is the opposite: public schools are usually single sex, while many private schools are mixed sex. Motivations for single sex education range from religious ideas of sex segregation to beliefs that the sexes learn and behave differently, and, as such, they thrive in a single sex environment. In the 19th century, in Western countries, single sex girls' finishing schools, and women's colleges offered women a chance of education at a time when they were denied access to mainstream educational institutions. The former were especially common in Switzerland, the latter in the US\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease select one of the above contexts and respond with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It sets out to describe the natural structure of the whole of the animal kingdom based on comparative anatomy, and its natural history. Cuvier divided the animals into four \"embranchements\" (\"Branches\", roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (cnidaria and other phyla).\n\n[2] Animal Man: Buddy can mimic the abilities of any animal as a result of his encounter with a crashed alien spacecraft. He does this by either focusing on a specific animal near him, or, as he learns later, by drawing power from the animal kingdom in general (this enables him to even mimic animals that are extinct). The nature of these powers has been described in various ways, including the superficial \"alien radiation\" explanation of his early appearances, the reconstruction of his body by aliens with \"morphogenetic grafts\" at the cellular level, and, currently, mystical access to a \"morphogenetic field\" created by all living creatures, also known as \"The Red\". He does not grow wings to fly as a bird (instead he flies in classic \"Superman style\"), nor does he form gills to breathe underwater when mimicking a fish, but he has occasionally been known to mimic the actual appearances of animals, such as adopting the claws of a wolverine temporarily, or his metamorphosis toward the end of Delano's run on his series.\n\n[3] List of Animal Kingdom episodes: \"Animal Kingdom\" is an American drama television series developed by Jonathan Lisco, based on the 2010 Australian film by David Michôd. The series follows a 17-year-old boy, who, after the death of his mother, moves in with the Codys, a criminal family clan governed by matriarch Janine \"Smurf\" Cody (Ellen Barkin). \"Animal Kingdom\" debuted on TNT on June 14, 2016.\n\n[4] Animal: In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges. The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia.\n\n[5] Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals: Awareness in species is difficult to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will fall out of the hole in the wall. It does not need awareness, but it does seem to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.\n\n[6] Online Chess Kingdoms: Rolando Cordova of IGN gave \"Online Chess Kingdoms\" a score of 6.0 out of 10. He praised the \"attention grabbing ... visual style\", \"fun to watch\" animated battles, and computer AI, which \"does a fine job of challenging a range of players, from novice to master strategists\", but felt the game \"offers nothing that previous chess videogames haven't covered a billion times before. ... Regardless of what the pieces look like, or how well they're animated, they still behave the same way.\" Cordova said the online mode \"works fine, but finding a partner can take a good long while.\" He concluded that while \"Online Chess Kingdoms\" \"offer[s] a new visual style to [chess]\", players should not buy it \"expecting to find a revolutionized and less complicated version of [the game].\"\n\n[7] Anthropocentrism: Author and anthropocentrism defender Wesley J. Smith from the Discovery Institute has written that human exceptionalism is what gives rise to human duties to each other, the natural world, and to treat animals humanely. Writing in \"A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy\", a critique of animal rights ideology, \"Because we \"are\" unquestionably a unique species—the only species capable of even contemplating ethical issues and assuming responsibilities—we uniquely are capable of apprehending the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, proper and improper conduct toward animals. Or to put it more succinctly if being human isn't what requires us to treat animals humanely, what in the world does?\"\n\n[8] Disney's Animal Kingdom: Disney does not allow plastic straws, lids, or balloons to be used in the park, unlike the rest of the Disney parks. This is so that plastic does not inadvertently enter an animal's habitat and hurt them. Instead, the park uses biodegradable paper straws and offers lids for hot drinks only.\n\n[9] Twisted (musical): \"Twisted\" is presented as an alternate history of the events of \"Aladdin\": instead of being a scheming villain, Ja'far is a good-intentioned, hard-working official who wants what's best for the kingdom, but is nevertheless blamed for all the problems of society. The Princess is portrayed not as a heroine, but as an arrogant spoiled child who doesn't realize the potential consequences of humiliating a powerful foreign prince. Aladdin is lazy and immature, thieving because he does not want to work, and not caring about the victims of his crimes. Instead of taking place in Agrabah, the events unfold in \"the Magic Kingdom\", an analog for The Walt Disney Company and its financial struggles in the 1990s. The foreign kingdom of Pik-zahr is based on Pixar, the pioneer of 3-D animation. The rivalry between the companies ended in 2006 when Disney bought out Pixar.\n\n[10] Cavalier-Smith's system of classification: The use of the word \"kingdom\" to describe the living world dates as far back as Linnaeus (1707–1778) who divided the natural world into three kingdoms: animal, vegetable, and mineral. The classifications \"animal kingdom\" (or kingdom Animalia) and \"plant kingdom\" (or kingdom Plantae) remain in use by modern evolutionary biologists.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [4].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know if the question is answered in any of the contexts provided?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.

It is part of the municipality of Erquelinnes and is located on the main road from Mons to Beaumont. Its French neighbour is called Vieux-Reng.\n\n[3] Beaumont, Belgium: Beaumont () is a Walloon municipality located in the Belgian province of Hainaut, on the border with France. On January 1, 2012, Beaumont had a total population of 7,060. The total area is 92.97 km2.\n\n[4] French Hainaut: French Hainaut is one of two areas in France that form the département du Nord, the easterly area. It corresponds roughly with the Arrondissement of Avesnes-sur-Helpe (east), Arrondissement of Cambrai (south-west) and Arrondissement of Valenciennes (north-west).\n\n[5] County of Hainaut: The County of Hainaut (, ; ; ), sometimes given the spelling Hainault, was a historical lordship within the medieval Holy Roman Empire with its capital eventually established at Mons (), and named after the river Haine, both now in Belgium. Besides Mons, it included the city of Valenciennes, now in France. It consisted of what is now the Belgian province of Hainaut and the eastern part of the French \"département\" of Nord.\n\n[6] Nervii: Hainaut was sometimes referred to as the county of the Nervians (\"comitatus nerviensis\") in medieval Latin, and when this came to be politically united with mainly Dutch speaking Brabant again, the counties were still distinguished in the official Latin titles (\"comitatus Nerviensis atque Bracbatensis\"). Today, Hainaut is divided between France and Belgium. To its north the modern Belgian provinces of Antwerp, Flemish Brabant and French-speaking Walloon Brabant approximate the rest of the old Nervian territory.\n\n[7] French Hainaut: Until the 17th century it was an integral part of the County of Hainaut, ruled by the Burgundians and later the Habsburgs. In a series of wars between France and Spain, this southern part of Hainaut was conquered by France, together with the adjacent smaller Cambresis or the Bishopric of Cambrai to the south-west, loosely associated with it, and the similar area to these two combined in the west, southern Flanders, which borders on the English Channel (French: la Manche). Together these formed the French province of Flandre immediately before the French Revolution, which became the current Nord département.\n\n[8] INTERREG IV France-Wallonie-Vlaanderen: The INTERREG IV France-Wallonie-Vlaanderen Programme 2007-2013, which is co-financed by the European Union, aims at intensifying the cooperation in a cross-border area of 62,000 km2 with around 10.5 million inhabitants: the provinces Hainaut, Namur, Luxembourg, Western Flanders and Eastern Flanders in Belgium and the departments Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Aisne and Ardennes in France.\n\n[9] Hainaut Province: The province derives from the French Revolutionary Jemmape department, formed in 1795 from part of the medieval County of Hainaut, the small territory of Tournai and the Tournaisis, a part of the county of Namur (Charleroi), and also a small part of the Prince-Bishopric of Liège (Thuin).

Certain Austrian holdings in Germany were passed to French allies—the King of Bavaria, the King of Württemberg and the Elector of Baden. Austrian claims on those German states were renounced without exception.\n\n[2] Hohenzollern-Haigerloch: All three territories were located in south-western Germany and were fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire. The area is now part of the German Land of Baden-Württemberg. Hechingen, Sigmaringen, and Haigerloch were the capitals of the three states.\n\n[3] History of Germany: In the first years of the 1st century AD Roman legions conducted a long campaign in Germania, the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, in an attempt to expand the Empire's frontiers and to shorten its frontier line. Rome subdued several Germanic tribes, such as the Cherusci. The tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their tribal identity. In 9 AD a Cherusci chieftain known to the Romans as Arminius defeated a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, a victory credited with stopping the Roman advance into Germanic territories. That part of the territory of modern Germany that lay east of the Rhine remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD 100, the time of Tacitus's \"Germania\", Germanic tribes had settled along the Roman frontier along the Rhine and the Danube (the \"Limes Germanicus\"), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; however, imperial Rome organised territory later included in the modern states of Austria, Baden-Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hesse, Saarland and the Rhineland as Roman provinces (Noricum, Raetia, and Germania). The Roman provinces in western Germany, Germania Inferior (with the capital situated at Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, modern Cologne) and Germania Superior (with its capital at Mogontiacum, modern Mainz), were formally established in 85 AD, after a long period of military occupation beginning in\n\n[4] Austria–Germany relations: Throughout the Middle and Early-modern Ages, the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) encompassed all of the present territories of Germany, Austria, Bohemia (Czech Republic), Slovenia, northern Italy and the western part of modern-day Poland. The House of Habsburg became the ruling family of the Empire in 1440; the family would remain so until the dissolution of the Austrian Empire in 1919.\n\n[5] Germany: Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights.\n\n[6] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen.

Due to the large historical extent from the 16th century of the Portuguese Empire and the subsequent colonization of territories in Asia, Africa and the Americas, as well as historical and recent emigration, Portuguese communities can be found in many diverse regions around the globe, and a large Portuguese diaspora exists.\n\n[2] Romani diaspora: The number of \"Ciganos\" in Portugal is difficult to estimate, since there are no official statistics about race or ethnic categories. According to data from Council of Europe's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance there are about 40,000 to 50,000 spread all over the country. According to the Portuguese branch of Amnesty International, there are about 30,000 to 50,000.\n\n[3] German nationality law: Significant communities of German citizens abroad are found in the following countries: More statistics at German diaspora#Distribution. There were 786,000 Germans in interwar Romania in 1939. USA: Large numbers of German citizens live permanently in the U.S., especially academics, artists, computer experts, engineers, and businesspeople. According to the German Missions in the US, “German citizens living abroad are not required to register with the German Embassy, so we are unable to say how many German citizens live in America.” Some of those Germans abroad hold passports from both Germany and the United States.\n\n[4] Portuguese Africans: Portuguese Africans () are Portuguese people born or permanently settled in Africa (they should not be confused with Portuguese of Black African ancestry). The largest Portuguese African population lives in Portugal numbering over 1 million with large and important minorities living in South Africa, Namibia and the Portuguese-speaking African countries (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe).The descendants of the Portuguese settlers who were born and \"raised\" locally since Portuguese colonial time were called \"crioulos\". Much of the original population is unnumbered having been assimilated into Portugal, Brazil, and other countries.\n\n[5] Portuguese Americans: There are three anthologies of Portuguese-American literature: \"Luso-American Literature: Writings by Portuguese-Speaking Authors in North America\" edited by Robert Henry Moser and António Luciano de Andrade Tosta and published in 2011, \"The Gávea-Brown Book of Portuguese-American Poetry\" edited by Alice R. Clemente and George Monteiro, published in 2013, and \"Writers of the Portuguese Diaspora in the United States and Canada: An Anthology\" edited by Luís Gonçalves and Carlo Matos, and published in 2015. The list of accomplished writers is considerable: Katherine Vaz, Frank X. Gaspar, Millicent Borges Accardi, Sam Pereira, Nancy Vieira Couto, Alfred Lewis, Charles Reis Felix and John dos Passos.\n\n[6] Portuguese in the United Kingdom: Of the 88,161 Portuguese-born residents of England and Wales recorded by the 2011 census, the vast majority were living in England. The English region with the largest concentration of Portuguese-born residents was London, accounting for almost half of the total England and Wales population. The South East had the second-largest concentration, closely followed by the East of England. Within London, the largest concentrations were in the boroughs of Lambeth (6,992 Portuguese-born residents) and Brent (3,076). Vauxhall in Lambeth is a \"long-standing hub for the Portuguese community\". Outside of London, Norfolk was the county with the largest concentration (3,418 Portuguese-born residents). Within Norfolk, 1,455 Portuguese-born people were living in Breckland, which includes the town of Thetford, which has been noted for its large Portuguese population.\n\n[7] Portuguese Brazilians: Economic reasons, with others of social, religious and political nature, are the main cause for the large Portuguese diaspora in Brazil. The country received the majority of Portuguese immigrants in the world.\n\n[8] Portuguese language: The combined population of the entire Lusophone area was estimated at 279 million in July 2017. This number does not include the Lusophone diaspora, estimated at approximately 10 million people (including 4.5 million Portuguese, 3 million Brazilians, and half a million Cape Verdeans, among others), although it is hard to obtain official accurate numbers of diasporic Portuguese speakers because a significant portion of these citizens are naturalized citizens born outside of Lusophone territory or are children of immigrants, and may have only a basic command of the language. Additionally, a large part of the diaspora is a part of the already-counted population of the Portuguese-speaking countries and territories, such as the high number of Brazilian and PALOP emigrant citizens in Portugal or the high number of Portuguese emigrant citizens in the PALOP and Brazil.\n\n[9] European Portuguese: In estimating the size of the speech community for European Portuguese, one must take into account the consequences of the Portuguese diaspora: immigrant communities located throughout the world in the Americas, Australia, Europe and Africa.\n\n[10] Portuguese people: Portuguese constitute 13% of the population of Luxembourg. In 2006 there were estimates to be over half a million people of Portuguese origin in the United Kingdom (see Portuguese in the United Kingdom)—this is considerably larger than the around 88,000 Portuguese-born people alone residing in the country in 2009 (estimation; however this figure does not include British-born people of Portuguese descent). In areas such as Thetford and the crown dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey, the Portuguese form the largest ethnic minority groups at 30% of the population, 7% and 3% respectively. The British capital London is home to the largest number of Portuguese people in the UK, with the majority being found in the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth and Westminster. The Portuguese diaspora communities still are very attached to their language, their culture and their national dishes and particularly the bacalhau.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [5], [6], [7], [9], and [10].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know how large the Portuguese diaspora in the US is?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\nCONTEXT: [1]\n\nReference(s):\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people#Historical_background", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Read the contexts carefully. If any of the contexts answers the question, respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is the most expensive type of wool?\n\nCONTEXTS:\n[1] Anatolian rug: Sheep wool is the most frequently used pile material in a Turkish rug because it is soft, durable, easy to work with and not too expensive. It is less susceptible to dirt than cotton, does not react electrostatically, and insulates against both heat and cold. This combination of characteristics is not found in other natural fibers. Wool comes from the coats of sheep. Natural wool comes in colors of white, brown, fawn, yellow and gray, which are sometimes used directly without going through a dyeing process. Sheep wool also takes dyes well. Traditionally, wool used for Turkish carpets is spun by hand. Before the yarn can be used for weaving, several strands have to be twisted together for additional strength.\n\n[2] Pot-holder: What makes wool a unique product is that it is essentially flame resistant. The combination of sulfur and nitrogen provides a blend of materials that provide a flame-resistant product. The reason wool is used for many types of heat protection is that it has a low ignition temperature. This is defined as the temperature in which an item will produce a flame. Wool can be heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit before the igniting of this fabric. Even when the fabric comes in contact with flames it does not disseminate the flame. This provides an even greater protective quality with the wool's low ignition temperature and the inability for flames to spread throughout the fiber. When wool is heated to a certain degree, it begins to \"char\" on the outside. This can provide a protective outer layer on the outside fabric. When the char on the outside of the fabric is consistent with the original properties of the wool, it can produce a safer version of the product. When the heat is directly applied to the fabric, the \"char\" forms a semi-liquid state which can be wiped off the fabric providing no evidence of the heat contact.\n\n[3] Wool insulation: Wool insulation is made from sheep wool fibres that are either mechanically held together or bonded using between 5% and 20% recycled polyester adhesive to form insulating batts, rolls and ropes. Natural wool insulation is effective for both thermal and acoustic insulation. The wool is often sourced from the less expensive black wools of the UK and Europe. Batts are commonly used in the walls and ceilings of timber-frame buildings, rolls can be cut to size for lofts, and ropes can be used between the logs in log homes. Natural wool insulation should be distinguished from mineral wool insulation, also called slag wool or rock wool, which only resembles natural wool fibers. It is actually made from rock, blast furnace slag, and other raw materials which are melted and spun into fibers.\n\n[4] Qiviut: It is most commonly used for hats and scarves, and is among the softest wools. It is very expensive; a high quality knitted scarf can cost more than $300 U.S., but will last over 20 years with good care.\n\n[5] Scottish Blackface: Scottish Blackface wool is a speciality wool in a class of its own. There are variations in type of fleece according to the way the sheep were bred. In general, there are a southwest type (short wool) and a central Scotland type (long wool). The southwest type is the finer, with a Bradford count of forty or so, generally classed as short or medium: ewe's fleece of 3 to 41⁄2 lb, greasy. The central type is a stronger wool classed as long or deep strong; this type gives a ewe fleece of 5 to 61⁄2 lb, greasy. The main markets are the mattress and upholstery trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. Strong Blackface wool undoubtedly makes the best mattress filling there is: the demand for this is very good. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Blackface wool. The finer wools are used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating, working tweeds and heavy blankets, The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade. The American Sheep Industry Association reports an average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of .\n\n[6] Carpet: Wool has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term \"80/20\". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises a small portion of the market.\n\n[7] Moxon Huddersfield: The company was acquired in 1993 by Firas Chamsi-Pasha, a Syrian former agent of Hield. Mr Chamsi-Pasha dropped 90% of the company's customer base and concentrated its production in the most expensive segment of the cloth market, with retail price up to £4,200 a metre in 2005 for fabrics such as a 12.9 micron wool or a super-fine wool with an 18 ct gold stripe. Mr Chamsi-Pasha marketed Super 180s fabrics in 1998 and Super 210s fabrics in 2000. He claimed in 2003 he was willing to pay \"silly prices\" to acquire wool with a fiber measuring less than 12 microns and had bought 26 pounds of wool with a fiber measuring 11.5 microns. The company uses antique machinery together with up-to-date equipment, such as a £120,000 scouring machine. In 2006, Joanne Alsop, then head designer of the company, won a Silver Shuttle Award from the Worshipful Company of Weavers. As of 2010, the company was using 8 looms and producing about 500 single pieces or 35,000 metres per year, using archives going back to the 1930s for ideas. As of 2011, its fabric are priced between £300 ($480) and £11,000 ($17,600) per metre. 95% of the production is exported.\n\n[8] Bakhtiari rug: Bakhtiari carpets are based on a cotton foundation (warp) with a wool weft usually taken from the herds of the producing tribe. This leads to unique carpets that differ depending on the characteristics of each tribe’s wool. The wool can range from dull to extreme glossy and the resultant pile is clipped medium to high. The best carpets with the highest knot density are often known as \"Bibibaff\". Prices range considerably with the highest knot density rugs generally being the most expensive, but price is also affected by criteria such as the pattern and the dyes used. \"Chapel Shotur\" and \"Saman\" pieces are rated slightly beneath \"Bibibaff\" productions, but are still considered to be good to excellent. \"Hori\" carpets are of looser weave and inferior quality and as such, are generally widely affordable.\n\n[9] Boolardy: The station has consistently produced quality wool attracting high prices, at a wool sale in Perth in 1927 a small star lot of super combing sold from the station was sold for 281⁄2d per pound, the most expensive at the sale.\n\n[10] Salish weaving: Sheep's wool, or \"mah-too-EHL-kel\", is the most common material used for modern Salish weaving. Some knitters still buy shorn fleeces and go through most of the traditional preparation, but most buy the washed and carded wool directly from a commercial carding mill. The fleece is lightly washed in a tub of tepid water and then hung outside to dry. It is then teased or picked apart with fingers to remove any matted areas and loose dirt. The wool is then carded, leaving the wool in soft batts, where the fibers lie lengthwise. Taken to the spinning machine, the wool is deftly hand fed into the axle of the spindle. This separates sections of the batt of wool and allows the desired amount of spinning to take place before the tension is eased to wind the wool onto the spindle. When the spindle has filled, the wool is unwound and stored in balls or skeins.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "Please answer the question based on the given contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

He is the son of the late real estate mogul Abraham Hirschfeld.\n\n[3] Eli Harvey: Eli Harvey (September 23, 1860 – February 10, 1957) was an American sculptor, painter and animalier. Harvey was born in Ogden, Ohio, a Quaker community in Clinton County, to William P. and Nancy M. Harvey. He attended art school in the Cincinnati Art Academy where he studied painting with Thomas Satterwhite Noble and sculpture with Louis Rebisso. In 1889 he moved to Paris where he continued his studies, with Lefebvre, Constant, Doucet and finally Frémiet. In 1897 he began exhibiting sculptures of animals at paris salons and continued doing so until returning to the United States in 1900, by which time he was \"firmly committed to animal sculpture.\"\n\n[4] Gunnar Heckscher: Heckscher was born in Djursholm, son of economist Eli Heckscher. He graduated from Uppsala University in 1927 and obtained a PhD 1934. He lectured in political science at Uppsala between 1933 and 1941 and at what later became Stockholm University between 1941 and 1948. He was Dean of the Social Institute of Stockholm 1945-1954. He became a professor in 1948 and worked at both the Social Institute and at Stockholm University.\n\n[5] August Heckscher II: Heckscher was born in Huntington on Long Island on September 16, 1913. He was the son of Gustave Maurice Heckscher (1884–1967) and Frances Louise Vanderhoef. His parents divorced in 1927 and his mother remarried to John M. P. Thatcher in 1931. His brother was Gustave Maurice Heckscher, Jr.\n\n[6] Eli Heckscher: Heckscher was born in Stockholm, son of the Jewish Danish-born businessman Isidor Heckscher and his spouse Rosa Meyer, and completed his secondary education there in 1897. He studied at Uppsala University and Gothenburg University, completing his PhD in Uppsala in 1907. He was professor of Political economy and Statistics at the Stockholm School of Economics from 1909 until 1919, when he exchanged that chair for a research professorship in economic history, finally retiring as emeritus professor in 1945. In 1929 Heckscher founded the Institute for Economic History Research.\n\n[7] August Heckscher: Heckscher was born in Hamburg, Germany. He was the son of Johann Gustav Heckscher (1797-1865) and Marie Antoinette Brautigan.\n\n[8] Eli Hurvitz: Eliyahu (Eli) Hurvitz was born in Jerusalem, in the British Mandate of Palestine, in 1932. In 1934, his family moved to Tel Aviv. In May 1948, he and his classmates were drafted by the Israel Defense Forces to fight in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In early 1949 he resumed his studies for five months and completed his matriculation (Bagrut) exams. After graduation, he joined kibbutz Tel Katzir, where he met Dalia Solomon. In June 1953 they married, and they left the kibbutz in October.\n\n[9] William S. Heckscher: In 1932–1933, Heckscher lived in New York where he worked as Panofsky's assistant. During this time, he enrolled in the Graduate Department of Art History at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University to study American art history. Heckscher returned to Germany to continue his studies in 1934. He and his mother were detained by the Gestapo and interrogated for ten days after being accused of having pacifist connections.\n\n[10] William S. Heckscher: From 1918 to 1921, the family lived in the Netherlands while Heckscher's father served as the Weimar Republic's ambassador to The Hague; there, Heckscher enrolled at the Nederlandsch Lyceum. Heckscher pursued his interests in history and Flemish art by spending his off hours studying at the Dutch Royal Library, the Mauritshuis and the Kröller-Müller Museum, but was dismissed from the Lyceum in 1920 for \"lack of scholarly potential\". After the family returned to Hamburg, Heckscher attended the city's Kunstgewerbeschule, now the Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg, but failed a class in ceramics.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [6].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "I don't know.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\nCONTEXT:\n[6] Eli Heckscher: Heckscher was born in Stockholm, son of the Jewish Danish-born businessman Isidor Heckscher and his spouse Rosa Mey", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [6].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\n(The question asks for the birthplace of Eli Heckscher, but none of the contexts provide that information.)", "Orca-2-7b": "Yes, answer is present", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "Stockholm"}}

PA 216 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 116 east of Hanover east and north to US 30 west of York, following its current alignment east to Glen Rock before it turned north and ran through Seven Valleys before reaching US 30. At this time, the route was paved between PA 116 and west of Glenville, between east of Glenville and Glen Rock, and between Seven Valleys and US 30. In 1930, PA 216 was realigned to head east from Glen Rock to US 111 (Susquehanna Trail) south of Loganville, with PA 616 designated onto the former alignment between Glen Rock and US 30. At this time, the entire length of PA 216 was paved. By 1940, Seaks Run Road was an unpaved road while Swamp Road was a paved road. Seaks Run Road was paved in the 1940s. PA 216 was extended east to an interchange with I-83/US 111 in 1960. The route was extended east from I-83 to PA 24 in Winterstown in 1961 in order to provide a numbered route at the interchange with I-83.\n\n[2] The Six Parts Seven: The Six Parts Seven is an American post-rock band formerly based in Kent, Ohio. The band was founded in 1995 by brothers Allen Allaman and Jay Karpinski (playing guitar and drums, respectively), who had earlier played with Old Hearts Club, a band of similar style (but with vocals). In 1998, Tim Gerak was added to the core member line-up, playing guitar and also credited with additional engineering on the band's later recordings.\n\n[3] Ohio State Route 216: State Route 216 (SR 216) is a north–south state highway in the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. state of Ohio. The southern terminus of SR 216 is at a three-way stop T-intersection with SR 78 in Murray City. SR 216's northern terminus is also at a three-way stop T-intersection, this time with SR 93 in New Straitsville.\n\n[4] Area code 216: Area code 216 is the North American telephone area code for Cleveland, Ohio, and most of its inner-ring suburbs in Cuyahoga County. Some of the local exchanges contained in the 216 area are: 281 (Atlantic), 476 (Garfield), 631 (Melrose), 642 (Michigan), and 749 (Shadyside).\n\n[5] Pennsylvania Route 616: When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 616 was not given a number. In 1928, the road between Glen Rock and US 30 west of York was designated as part of PA 216, which turned west from Glen Rock. At this time, the road was paved between Seven Valleys and US 30 while the portion between Glen Rock and Seven Valleys was unpaved. PA 216 was realigned to head east from Glen Rock in 1930 and PA 616 was designated to run from PA 216 in Glen Rock north to US 30 west of York along the former portion of PA 216. By this time, the road between Railroad and Glen Rock was unnumbered, with the section between Seitzland and Glen Rock paved. In 1937, PA 616 was extended south from Glen Rock to the Maryland border south of New Freedom, following its current alignment to Railroad before running along 2nd Street, Main Street, and Front Street. The entire length of PA 616 was paved in the 1930s. In the 1950s, the southern terminus of PA 616 was cut back to PA 516 (now PA 851) in Railroad, with PA 516 (later PA 851) replacing the route between New Freedom and Railroad and the remainder between the Maryland border and New Freedom becoming unnumbered.\n\n[6] 6, 7, 8: Six in the Seven at Eight, usually called 6, 7, 8, was an Argentine political commentary TV program broadcast by the government-run Channel 7 since 2009. Its name comes from the fact that, when it first started airing, there were five members on the show's panel, and its motto was \"you are the sixth one\" (the viewer). Since it was broadcast by Channel 7 at 8 p.m., the name was shortened to \"6, 7, 8\". In late 2009, the program was moved to 9 p.m., a new segment was added to be aired on Sundays at night, and new guest panelists were invited, making it more than six members. Nevertheless, the show's name remained unchanged.\n\n[7] Seventeen (South Korean band): Seventeen (), also stylized as SEVENTEEN or SVT, is a South Korean boy group formed by Pledis Entertainment in 2015. The group consists of thirteen members divided into three sub-units, each with a different area of specialization: a 'Hip-Hop Unit', 'Vocal Unit', and 'Performance Unit'. Seventeen has released two studio albums and five extended plays.\n\n[8] 216 Parachute Signal Squadron: 216 (Parachute) Squadron, Royal Signals (216 (Para) Sigs Sqn or simply, 216) is a Squadron of the British Army's Royal Corps of Signals. It is responsible for installing, maintaining and operating all types of telecommunications equipment and information systems in support of 16 Air Assault Brigade. 216 Parachute Signal Squadron provide OpCIS and TacCIS to the Bde Comd and his staff.\n\n[9] Seven, They Are Seven: Seven, They Are Seven () (op. 30) is a cantata by Sergei Prokofiev composed in 1917 for large orchestra, chorus, and dramatic tenor soloist. It was composed in Yessentuki and Kislovodsk, and the words are taken from the poem \"Ancient Calls\" (Зовы древности) by Konstantin Balmont. It was revised by Prokofiev in 1933.\n\n[10] 216: Year 216 (CCXVI) was a leap year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sabinus and Anullinus (or, less frequently, year 969 \"Ab urbe condita\"). The denomination 216 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" if you see any information that answers the question, or \"I don't know\" if you do not see any information that answers the question.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.", "Orca-2-7b": "\nI don't know", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "Yes, answer is present"}}

Some countries do not have encrypted phone data traffic (or very weak encryption), thus rendering an IMSI-catcher unnecessary.\n\n[4] IMSI-catcher: The GSM specification requires the handset to authenticate to the network, but does \"not\" require the network to authenticate to the handset. This well-known security hole is exploited by an IMSI catcher. The IMSI catcher masquerades as a base station and logs the IMSI numbers of all the mobile stations in the area, as they attempt to attach to the IMSI-catcher. It allows forcing the mobile phone connected to it to use no call encryption (A5/0 mode) or to use easily breakable encryption (A5/1 or A5/2 mode), making the call data easy to intercept and convert to audio.\n\n[5] IMSI-catcher: IMSI-catchers are often deployed by court order without a search warrant, the lower judicial standard of a pen register and trap-and-trace order being preferred by law enforcement. They can also be used in search and rescue operation for missing persons. Police departments have been reluctant to reveal use of these programs and contracts with vendors such as Harris Corporation, the maker of Stingray and Kingfish phone tracker devices.\n\n[6] IMSI-catcher: Every mobile phone has the requirement to optimize the reception. If there is more than one base station of the subscribed network operator accessible, it will always choose the one with the strongest signal. An IMSI-catcher masquerades as a base station and causes every mobile phone of the simulated network operator within a defined radius to log in. With the help of a special identity request, it is able to force the transmission of the IMSI.\n\n[7] IMSI-catcher: The application Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD) is being developed to detect and circumvent IMSI-catchers, StingRay and silent SMS. Technology for a stationary network of IMSI-catcher detectors has also been developed. Several apps listed on the Google Play Store as IMSI catcher detector apps include SnoopSnitch, Cell Spy Catcher, and GSM Spy Finder and have between 100,000 and 500,000 app downloads each. However, these apps have limitations in that they do not have access to phone's underlying hardware and may offer only minimal protection.\n\n[8] IMSI-catcher: The IMSI-catcher subjects the phones in its vicinity to a man-in-the-middle attack, appearing to them as a preferred base station in terms of signal strength. With the help of a SIM, it simultaneously logs into the GSM network as a mobile station. Since the encryption mode is chosen by the base station, the IMSI-catcher can induce the mobile station to use no encryption at all. Hence it can encrypt the plain text traffic from the mobile station and pass it to the base station.\n\n[9] Telephone tapping: To the mobile phones in its vicinity, a device called an \"IMSI-catcher\" pretends to be a legitimate base station of the mobile phone network, thus subjecting the communication between the phone and the network to a man-in-the-middle attack. This is possible because, while the mobile phone has to authenticate itself to the mobile telephone network, the network does not authenticate itself to the phone. There is no defense against IMSI-catcher based eavesdropping, except using end-to-end call encryption; products offering this feature, secure telephones, are already beginning to appear on the market, though they tend to be expensive and incompatible with each other, which limits their proliferation.\n\n[10] IMSI-catcher: The assignment of an IMSI catcher has a number of difficulties:Some preliminary research has been done in trying to detect and frustrate IMSI-catchers. One such project is through the Osmocom open source mobile station software. This is a special type of mobile phone firmware that can be used to detect and fingerprint certain network characteristics of IMSI-catchers, and warn the user that there is such a device operating in their area. But this firmware/software-based detection is strongly limited to a select few, outdated GSM mobile phones (i.e. Motorola) that are no longer available on the open market. The main problem is the closed-source nature of the major mobile phone producers.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond to the question \"What does \"\"IMSI\"\" stand for in IMSI-catcher?\"", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present.\nReference(s):\n[4]", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [4].\n\nThe answer to the question \"What does \"\"IMSI\"\" stand for in IMSI-catcher?\" is present in context [4], which states that \"IMSI", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.\n\nThe contexts do not provide the definition of IMSI in the context of IMSI-catcher.", "Orca-2-7b": "Yes, answer is present.", "Orca-2-13b": "Yes, answer is present", "aya-101": "Yes, answer is present"}}

Hinduism contains many different sub-cultures just like most other religions. The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the \"Prajapatis\" for example, hold water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times. This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\n[2] List of Hindu deities: Cults of goddess worship are ancient in India. In the Rigveda, the most prominent goddess is Ushas, the goddess of dawn. In modern Hinduism, goddesses are widely revered. Shaktism is one of the major sects of Hinduism. Followers of Shaktism believe that the goddess (Devi) is the power (Shakti) that underlies the female principle, and that Devi is the supreme being, one and the same with Para Brahman. Shakti has many forms/manifestations like Parvati, Durga, and others but there are also goddesses that are parts of Shakti such as Lakshmi and Saraswati. Devi is believed to manifest in peaceful forms, such as Parvati the consort of Shiva and also in fierce forms, such as Kali and Durga. In Shaktism, Adi Parashakti is regarded as Ultimate Godhead or Para Brahman. She is formless i.e. Nirguna in reality, but may take many forms i.e. Saguna. Durga and Lalita Tripurasundari are regarded as the Supreme goddess in the Kalikula and Srikula systems respectively. Shaktism is closely related with Tantric Hinduism, which teaches rituals and practices for purification of the mind and body. Some different parts of Shakti (Devi) the Mother Goddess:\n\n[3] Hindu deities: Thirty-three divinities are mentioned in other ancient texts, such as the Yajurveda, however, there is no fixed \"number of deities\" in Hinduism any more than a standard representation of \"deity\". There is, however, a popular perception stating that there are 33 million deities in Hinduism. Most, by far, are goddesses, state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting \"how important and popular goddesses are\" in Hindu culture. No one has a list of the 33 category goddesses and gods, but scholars state all deities are typically viewed in Hinduism as \"emanations or manifestation of genderless principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality\".\n\n[4] Hinduism and LGBT topics: The most numerous third-gender sect (estimated at 150,000) is the \"aravani\" or \"ali\" of Tamil Nadu in southern India. The \"aravanis\" are typically transgender and their main festival, the popular Koovagam or Aravan Festival celebrated in late April/early May, is attended by thousands, including many transgender people and homosexuals. The \"aravani\" worship the Hindu god, Aravan, and do not practice any system of castration.\n\n[5] List of Hindu deities: Vaishnavism is the sect within Hinduism that worships Vishnu, the preserver god of the Hindu \"Trimurti\" ('three images', the Trinity), and his ten incarnations. It is a devotional sect, and followers worship many deities, including Rama and Krishna of the 2 epics, both considered as incarnations of Vishnu. The adherents of this sect are generally non-ascetic, monastic and devoted to meditative practice and ecstatic chanting. Some alternate names of Vishnu the Preserver:\n\n[6] Hinduism in Indonesia: Among the non-Balinese communities considered to be Hindu by the government are, for example, the Dayak adherents of the Kaharingan religion in Kalimantan Tengah, where government statistics counted Hindus as 15.8% of the population . Many Manusela and Nuaulu people of Seram follow Naurus, a syncretism of Hinduism with animist and Protestant elements. Similarly, the Tana Toraja of Sulawesi have identified their animistic religion as Hindu. The Batak of Sumatra have identified their animist traditions with Hinduism. Among the minority Indian ethnic group, Tamils and Punjabis of Medan, Sumatra and the Sindhis in Jakarta practice their own form of Hinduism which is similar to the Indian Hinduism, the Indians celebrating Hindu holidays more commonly found in India, such as Deepavali and Thaipusam The Bodha sect of Sasak people on the island of Lombok are non-Muslim; their religion is a fusion of Hinduism and Buddhism with animism; it is considered Buddhist by the government. In parts of Samarinda and Lombok especially Cakranegara, Nyepi is celebrated.\n\n[7] Omallur: Various sections of Christianity and Hinduism co-exist , the Ezhavas, Nairs, Viswakarmas, Veerashaivas and the Scheduled Class & Tribes constitute the major sections of the Hindu religion. Followers of Christianity Orthodox church, Jacobite Church, Marthoma Church,Malankara Catholic Church, St. Thomas Evangelical Church, Church of South India, Pentecostal Churches, and Brethren form major Christian sects.\n\n[8] Gujarat Freedom of Religion Bill: Bhartiya Dharma Rakshak Sena (BDRS), a small organisation said to be run by Jains, maintains that all religions in India are a part of Hinduism, \"which is not a religion but a culture.\" In a press release, on 22 September 2006, Jasmin Shah, Piyush Jain and Abhay Shah of BDRS stated that the controversy is being promoted by forces who want to weaken Hinduism by creating minorities. They state that \"Jainism is independent of Vedic religion, known as 'Hinduism'\". The BDRS members claimed that there four sub-sects in Jainism, out of which one, the Digambara sect, is demanding a minority status.\n\n[9] Women in Hinduism: There is a popular perception that there exist millions of Hindu deities. However, most, by far, are goddesses (\"Shakti, devi,\" or mother), state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting \"how important and popular goddesses are\" in Hindu culture. Though in general they are smaller, there are far more goddess temples than those of gods. Goddesses are most of the time, if not always seen as powerful, and when unmarried, seen as dangerous. Despite the patriarchal nature of Hindu society, women are seen as powerful alongside the Gods, and at certain times, dangerous. No one has a list of the millions of goddesses and gods, but all deities, state scholars, are typically viewed in Hinduism as \"emanations or manifestation of gender-less principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality\". In Hinduism, \"God, the universe, all beings [male, female] and all else is essentially one thing\" and everything is connected oneness, the same god is in every being as Atman, the eternal Self.\n\n[10] Hinduism and LGBT topics: Below are listed some of the most common third-gender sects found in Hinduism. There are an estimated half million crossdressing \"eunuchs\" in modern-day India, associated with various sects, temples and Hindu deities. Despite being called \"eunuchs\", the majority of these persons (91%) do not practice castration but are more accurately associated with transgender.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\nHow many sects of Hinduism are there?\n\nNote: Please answer based on the information provided in the given contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

It is recognised in its home country by the French Kennel Club (Société Centrale Canine, S.C.C) and internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The S.C.C. prohibits inbreeding or linebreeding and will not register any dog with common ancestors in the first three generations of its pedigree. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the Canadian Kennel Club in Canada and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. recognise them. The Canadian Kennel Club recognises one breed, the Braque Français (Gascogne) in its Sporting Dogs Group and the United Kennel Club recognises both breeds, in its Gundog Group, with the names Braque Francais De Grande Taille and Braque Francais, De Petite Taille - \"petite taille\" (smaller size) means the Pyrenean is smaller than the Gascogne, and does \"not\" mean that it is a little dog. The breeds are also recognized by many minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses under various versions of the names, and promoted as rare breeds for those seeking unique pets.\n\n[2] Northern breed group: Many of the regional breeds recognised by the United Kennel Club are very few in number in the United States. As a US-based club they have specialized in the registry of North American breeds, especially hunting and working/utility dogs. Since many of these breeds are few in number (so called rare breeds), they also may be listed with a variety of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses. In this Group, the Alaskan Klee Kai (a new breed developed from a mixed breed dog in the 1970s in Alaska, USA) can be still be registered with the American Rare Breed Association as well as with the United Kennel Club.\n\n[3] Dog breed: Kennel clubs provide the recognition of distinct dog breeds, but there are many independent clubs with differing, and sometimes inconsistent standards and they need not apply scientific standards. Four varieties of the Belgian Shepherd Dog are recognised as four distinct breeds by the New Zealand Kennel Club. Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the feist is a hunting dog raised in the Southern United States for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other dog types and breeds. However, the United Kennel Club recognizes one breed of feist, the Treeing Feist, while the American Kennel Club does not recognize any feist breed.\n\n[4] American Eskimo Dog: After World War II, the dogs continued to be popular pets. Postwar contact with Japan led to importation into the United States of the Japanese Spitz, which may have been crossed into the breed at this time. The breed was first officially recognized as the \"American Eskimo\" as early as 1919 by the American United Kennel Club (UKC), and the first written record and history of the breed was printed in 1958 by the UKC. At that time there was no official breed club and no breed standard, and dogs were accepted for registration as single dogs, based on appearance. In 1970 the National American Eskimo Dog Association (NAEDA) was founded, and single dog registrations ceased. In 1985 the American Eskimo Dog Club of America (AEDCA) was formed by fanciers who wished to register the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Following the AKC's requirements for breed recognition, the AEDCA collected the pedigree information from 1,750 dogs that now form the basis of the AKC recognized breed, which is called the American Eskimo Dog. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995. The stud book was opened from 2000 to 2003 in an attempt to register more of the original UKC registered lines, and today many American Eskimo Dogs are dual-registered with both American kennel clubs. The breed is also recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club as of 2006, but is not recognized elsewhere in the world\n\n[5] Poodle crossbreed: There were over 220 hybrid designer dogs recognized by the American Canine Hybrid Club in 2006 and now, including various poodle crossbreeds.Some breed associations, such as the AKC, the UKC, and the CKC, do not recognize this crossbreed, or any other designer cross, as a breed in its own right. However, some major kennel clubs do accept registration of crossbreed and mixed-breed dogs for performance events such as agility and obedience. There is another registry, the CKC Continental Kennel Club, that does register hybrids if they have registered parents, but they are registered as non-purebred dogs, not as a breed.\n\n[6] Dogs in the United States: A variety of American dog breeds are noted to have been mixed with Spanish and French dog breeds. The European idea of registering dog breeds and breed clubs led to the foundation of Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1873. The American Kennel Club, prevalent in The United States, was highly influenced by this European predecessor. Currently, The American Kennel Club is the largest purebred dog registry, and registers more than 1 million dogs each year. The kennel club also organizes events for purebred dogs.\n\n[7] Toy dog: Most major dog clubs in the English-speaking world have a toy group, under one exact name or another, in which they place breeds of dog that the kennel club categorises as \"toy\", based on size and tradition. The Kennel Club (UK), the Canadian Kennel Club, the American Kennel Club, the Australian National Kennel Council, and the New Zealand Kennel Club all have a group named \"Toy\", all though they may not all categorise the same breeds in this category. The United States has a second major kennel club, the United Kennel Club (UKC, originally formed for hunting and working breeds, though general today), and it does not recognize such a group; instead, small dogs are placed with larger dogs of their type, or into a UKC's \"Companion Dog\" group. the American Kennel Club began debating whether or not to change the name of their \"Toy\" group to \"Companion\", in order to emphasise that dogs are not playthings, but the name change was resisted by traditionalists.\n\n[8] Toy dog: In addition, these national organizations also recognize the following breeds in their toy groups:The major national kennel club for each country will have its own list of breeds that it recognizes as Toy. In addition, some new or newly documented rare breeds may be awaiting approval by a given kennel club. Some new breeds may currently be recognized only by their breed clubs. Some rare new breeds have been given breed names, but may only be available from the breeder or breeders who are developing the breed, and may not yet be recognized by any kennel club.\n\n[9] Scent hound: Many of the regional breeds recognised by the United Kennel Club are very few in number in the United States. As a US-based club they have specialised in the registry of North American breeds, especially hunting and working/utility dogs. The United Kennel Club also lists internationally recognised (Fédération Cynologique Internationale) breeds that are few in number outside their native areas. Many of these are called rare breeds in the United States, and breeders and dog owners may register their dogs with any of the very large number of small breed clubs, dog sport clubs, minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog businesses, in order to participate in the club's or business' activities. For breeds not yet recognised by one of the major kennel clubs, there are usually numerous competing breed clubs for each individual breed.\n\n[10] Dog crossbreed: If crossbred dogs are bred together for some period of time, and their breeding is well documented, they may eventually be considered a new breed of dog by major kennel clubs (an example of a recent crossbreed becoming a breed recognised by all major kennel clubs is the Cesky Terrier). New breeds of dogs must have a breed club that will document the ancestry of any individual member of that breed from the original founding dogs of the breed; when the kennel club that the breed club wishes to join is satisfied that the dogs are pedigreed, they will accept and register the dogs of that breed. Each kennel club has individual rules about how to document a new breed. Some minor registries and internet registry businesses will register dogs as any breed the owner chooses with minimal or no documentation; some even allow the breeder or owner to make up a designer \"breed name\" for their pet.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question:\n\nHow many dog breeds are there currently recognized by the Kennel Club?\n\nPlease answer with either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the information provided in the contexts.\n\nDoes the Kennel Club recognize the Braque Français breed?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

According to popular legend, it was founded at the base of Jabal Nuqum by Shem, the son of Noah, after the latter's death. It was known as \"Azal\" in ancient times, which has been connected to Uzal, a son of Qahtan, a great-grandson of Shem, in the biblical accounts of Genesis. Its name is related to the Sabaic word for \"well-fortified\", a name that echoes the meaning of the Ethiopian name—recorded in a Syriac account as \"Auzalites\"—the city held in the 6th century. Qahtan is considered to be the ancestor of \"true Arabs\".\n\n[3] Ĥ: Ĥ or ĥ is a consonant in Esperanto orthography, representing a voiceless velar fricative or voiceless uvular fricative . Its name in Esperanto is \"ĥo\" (pronounced ).\n\n[4] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[5] Ǧwayay: Ǧwayay corresponds with the tropical Zodiac sign Taurus. \"Ǧwayay\" literally means \"bull\" in Pashto.\n\n[6] Tehran: The origin of the name \"Tehran\" is uncertain. The settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.\n\n[7] Razmgah Kammando of Iran: The word Kammando (English: Commando) is interpreted by the founder of Razmgah in an interview with Radio Tehran (Persian: رادیو تهران) as one of the English words of Persian origin. According to that interpretation, Kammando is made up with Kamman (English: Arc) and Do (English: Two) and it means two upper and lower arcs referring to the physical and spiritual aspects of human being .\n\n[8] Salwāǧa: Salwāǧa corresponds with the tropical Zodiac sign Aquarius. \"Salwāǧa\" literally means \"pail of water\" in Pashto.\n\n[9] The Tehran Times: The Tehran Times is a fashion blog that was founded 2012 by Araz Fazaeli and is considered the first street fashion blog of Iran. While Fazaeli's blog aims are largely cultural and artistic—sharing Iranian street fashion with other, predominantly Western, audiences—Fazaeli also has larger motives of promoting cross-cultural understanding. In a September 2013 interview with \"The Atlantic Post\", Fazaeli explains these larger motives: “I have realized that people have a wrong understanding of us. They believe what they see in the news and even though a lot of it is true there is much more to see ... That is the side that I am trying to show. I don’t think many have portrayed that about Iranian women before.”\n\n[10] Tehranno: Tehranno () is one of the eastern neighborhoods in Tehran. It is located in region 13 of Tehran. It has 4 small squares, named Chaychi, Ettela'at, Ashtiani, and Lozi, respectively. However, Ashtiani Square has been torn down, because of the Bagheri highway's construction. Before the Islamic Revolution, some of the streets were named by the words beginning with \"Mehr,\" such as Mehrbar, Mehrafrooz, Mehrpoo, Mehravar, Mehrjoo, and Mehrayin. The previous name of Lozi Square was Mehr Square, but during the war between Iraq and Iran, some were renamed after people killed in the war. Other streets are named after famous poets, such as Hafez, Sa'di, Roodaki, Sa'eb tabrizi, Bou'ali, Sanayi, Ferdosi, and Molavi.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [6].\n\nPlease note that the answer is present in the context [6].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Please respond as either \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" for each context.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [6].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.\n\nThe contexts don't provide any information about the origin of the word \"Tehran\".

Besides his electrical activities, he invented a distinctive vacuum pump, a device to indicate ship stability and methods for electrically connecting lighthouses to the mainland. In 1878, he began to experiment with electrical influence machines for generating electrical sparks for scientific and entertainment purposes. Beginning in 1880, he became interested in electrostatic machines of the influence type. His house in Clapham, England, had a versatile workshop which had a wide variety of tools and devices for electric illumination. Wimshurst constructed several of the known types of electrostatic generators, such as those created by W. Nicholson, F. P. Carré and W. T. B. Holtz. To these predecessors, Wimshurst made many modifications with the result known as the Holtz-Wimshurst machine.\n\n[2] Scientific Revolution: This was followed in 1660 by Otto von Guericke, who invented an early electrostatic generator. By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction with an electrostatic generator, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. The first usage of the word \"electricity\" is ascribed to Sir Thomas Browne in his 1646 work, \"Pseudodoxia Epidemica\". In 1729 Stephen Gray (1666–1736) demonstrated that electricity could be \"transmitted\" through metal filaments.\n\n[3] Electrostatic generator: The first electrostatic generators are called \"friction machines\" because of the friction in the generation process. A primitive form of frictional machine was invented around 1663 by Otto von Guericke, using a sulphur globe that could be rotated and rubbed by hand. It may not actually have been rotated during use and was not intended to produce electricity (rather cosmic virtues), but inspired many later machines that used rotating globes. Isaac Newton suggested the use of a glass globe instead of a sulphur one. About 1706 Francis Hauksbee improved the basic design, with his frictional electrical machine that enabled a glass sphere to be rotated rapidly against a woollen cloth.\n\n[4] Electrostatic generator: In 1746, William Watson's machine had a large wheel turning several glass globes, with a sword and a gun barrel suspended from silk cords for its prime conductors. Johann Heinrich Winckler, professor of physics at Leipzig, substituted a leather cushion for the hand. During 1746, Jan Ingenhousz invented electric machines made of plate glass. Experiments with the electric machine were largely aided by the discovery of the Leyden Jar. This early form of the capacitor, with conductive coatings on either side of the glass, can accumulate a charge of electricity when connected with a source of electromotive force.\n\n[5] Van de Graaff generator: The concept of an electrostatic generator in which charge is mechanically transported in small amounts into the interior of a high-voltage electrode originated with the Kelvin water dropper, invented during 1867 by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), in which charged drops of water fall into a bucket with the same polarity charge, adding to the charge. In a machine of this type, the gravitational force moves the drops against the opposing electrostatic field of the bucket. Kelvin himself first suggested using a belt to carry the charge instead of water. The first electrostatic machine that used an endless belt to transport charge was constructed during 1872 by Augusto Righi. It used an india rubber belt with wire rings along its length as charge carriers, which passed into a spherical metal electrode. The charge was applied to the belt from the grounded lower roller by electrostatic induction using a charged plate. John Gray also invented a belt machine about 1890. Another more complicated belt machine was invented during 1903 by Juan Burboa A more immediate inspiration for Van de Graaff was a generator W. F. G. Swann was developing during the 1920s in which charge was transported to an electrode by falling metal balls, thus returning to the principle of the Kelvin water dropper.\n\n[6] Corbett's electrostatic machine: Corbett's experiments with electricity and its principles shows his interest in science and medicine. The electrostatic machine and his electrical experiments in the early 1800s took place between Benjamin Franklin's electrical experiments of the mid-1700s and that of Thomas Edison's electrical inventions. The electrical principles of Corbett's electrostatic machine were later used by Edison.Citations Sources\n\n[7] History of electromagnetic theory: In 1663 Otto von Guericke invented a device that is now recognized as an early (possibly the first) electrostatic generator, but he did not recognize it primarily as an electrical device or conduct electrical experiments with it. By the end of the 17th Century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction with an electrostatic generator, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity.\n\n[8] Franklin's electrostatic machine: Franklin's electrostatic machine is a high-voltage static electricity-generating device used by Benjamin Franklin in the mid-18th century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a glass globe which turned on an axis via a crank, a cloth pad in contact with the spinning globe, a set of metal needles to conduct away the charge developed on the globe by its friction with the pad, and a Leyden jara high-voltage capacitorto accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about electricity and inventing the lightning rod.\n\n[9] Wilhelm Holtz: In 1865 Holtz invented the \"Holtz electrostatic influence machine\", an electrostatic induction generator that converted mechanical work into electrostatic energy, needing only an initial charge to begin operation. In the following years, Holtz made modifications, and in the process, manufactured several more of the devices.\n\n[10] Electric generator: Before the connection between magnetism and electricity was discovered, electrostatic generators were invented. They operated on electrostatic principles, by using moving electrically charged belts, plates, and disks that carried charge to a high potential electrode. The charge was generated using either of two mechanisms: electrostatic induction or the triboelectric effect. Such generators generated very high voltage and low current. Because of their inefficiency and the difficulty of insulating machines that produced very high voltages, electrostatic generators had low power ratings, and were never used for generation of commercially significant quantities of electric power. Their only practical applications were to power early X-ray tubes, and later in some atomic particle accelerators.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "Please answer the following question:\nWhen was the electrostatic machine invented?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Rauschenbach was the owner, among other concerns, of IWC Schaffhausen – the International Watch Company, manufacturers of luxury time-pieces. Upon his death in 1905, his two daughters and their husbands became owners of the business. Jung's brother-in-law—Ernst Homberger—became the principal proprietor, but the Jungs remained shareholders in a thriving business that ensured the family's financial security for decades. Emma Jung, whose education had been limited, evinced considerable ability and interest in her husband's research and threw herself into studies and acted as his assistant at Burghölzli. She eventually became a noted psychoanalyst in her own right. They had five children: Agathe, Gret, Franz, Marianne, and Helene. The marriage lasted until Emma's death in 1955.\n\n[2] Carl Jung: In December 1937, Jung left Zurich again for an extensive tour of India with Fowler McCormick. In India, he felt himself \"under the direct influence of a foreign culture\" for the first time. In Africa, his conversations had been strictly limited by the language barrier, but in India he was able to converse extensively. Hindu philosophy became an important element in his understanding of the role of symbolism and the life of the unconscious, though he avoided a meeting with Ramana Maharshi. He described Ramana as being absorbed in \"the self\", but admitted to not understanding Ramana's self-realization or what he actually did do. He also admitted that his field of psychology was not competent to understand the eastern insight of the Atman \"the self\". Jung became seriously ill on this trip and endured two weeks of delirium in a Calcutta hospital. After 1938, his travels were confined to Europe.\n\n[3] Carl Jung: Jung was thirty when he sent his \"Studies in Word Association\" to Sigmund Freud in Vienna in 1906. The two men met for the first time the following year and Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable. He recalled that they talked almost unceasingly for thirteen hours. Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich. This marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years and ended in May 1913. At that time Jung resigned as the chairman of the International Psychoanalytical Association, a position to which he had been elected with Freud's support. Jung and Freud influenced each other during the intellectually formative years of Jung's life. Jung had become interested in psychiatry as a student by reading \"Psychopathia Sexualis\" by Richard von Krafft-Ebing. In 1900, Jung completed his degree, and started work as an intern (voluntary doctor) under the psychiatrist, Eugen Bleuler at Burghölzli Hospital. It was Bleuler who introduced him to the writings of Freud by asking him to write a review of \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1899). In 1905 Jung was appointed as a permanent 'senior' doctor at the hospital and also became a lecturer \"Privatdozent\" in the medical faculty of Zurich University. In that period psychology as a science was still in its early stages, but Jung became a qualified proponent of Freud's new \"\n\n[4] Claudia Jung: Claudia Jung's first husband was her former manager Jürgen Evers, whom she married in Düsseldorf on 1 September 1993. The marriage ended the following year and they were divorced. At the same time Jung met current husband Hans Singer, whom she married in 1997. The couple has a daughter, Anna Charlotte born August 4, 1997. Hans Singer has a son, David, a few years older. The family has lived since 1998 in a farm in Gerolsbach, district of Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm (Upper Bavaria). They have many animals living on the farm (about fifty between horses, goats, dogs and cats, etc.) Claudia Jung is an animal-friend, respecting and loving nature, and among her passions is vegetarianism.\n\n[5] Carl Jung: Jung did not plan to study psychiatry since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, exactly what he was searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie was a friend of Goethe's niece.\n\n[6] Carl Jung: In 1913, at the age of thirty-eight, Jung experienced a horrible \"confrontation with the unconscious\". He saw visions and heard voices. He worried at times that he was \"menaced by a psychosis\" or was \"doing a schizophrenia\". He decided that it was valuable experience and, in private, he induced hallucinations or, in his words, \"active imaginations\". He recorded everything he felt in small journals. Jung began to transcribe his notes into a large red leather-bound book, on which he worked intermittently for sixteen years.\n\n[7] Carl Jung: Carl Gustav Jung was born in Kesswil, in the Swiss canton of Thurgau, on 26 July 1875 as the second and first surviving son of Paul Achilles Jung (1842–1896) and Emilie Preiswerk (1848–1923). Their first child, born in 1873, was a boy named Paul who survived only a few days. Being the youngest son of a noted Basel physician of German descent, also called (1794–1864), whose hopes of achieving a fortune never materialised, Paul Jung did not progress beyond the status of an impoverished rural pastor in the Swiss Reformed Church; his wife had also grown up in a large family, whose Swiss roots went back five centuries. Emilie was the youngest child of a distinguished Basel churchman and academic, (1799–1871), and his second wife. Preiswerk was \"antistes\", the title given to the head of the Reformed clergy in the city, as well as a Hebraist, author and editor, who taught Paul Jung as his professor of Hebrew at Basel University.\n\n[8] Carl Jung: At the age of 12, shortly before the end of his first year at the in Basel, Jung was pushed to the ground by another boy so hard that he momentarily lost consciousness. (Jung later recognized that the incident was his fault, indirectly.) A thought then came to him—\"now you won't have to go to school anymore.\" From then on, whenever he walked to school or began homework, he fainted. He remained at home for the next six months until he overheard his father speaking hurriedly to a visitor about the boy's future ability to support himself. They suspected he had epilepsy. Confronted with the reality of his family's poverty, he realized the need for academic excellence. He went into his father's study and began poring over Latin grammar. He fainted three more times but eventually overcame the urge and did not faint again. This event, Jung later recalled, \"was when I learned what a neurosis is.\"\n\n[9] Carl Jung: Eventually a close friendship and a strong professional association developed between the elder Freud and Jung, which left a sizeable correspondence. For six years they cooperated in their work. In 1912, however, Jung published \"Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido\" (known in English as \"Psychology of the Unconscious\"), which made manifest the developing theoretical divergence between the two. Consequently, their personal and professional relationship fractured—each stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong. After the culminating break in 1913, Jung went through a difficult and pivotal psychological transformation, exacerbated by the outbreak of the First World War. Henri Ellenberger called Jung's intense experience a \"creative illness\" and compared it favorably to Freud's own period of what he called neurasthenia and hysteria.\n\n[10] Carl Jung: Jung's mother left Laufen for several months of hospitalization near Basel for an unknown physical ailment. His father took the boy to be cared for by Emilie Jung's unmarried sister in Basel, but he was later brought back to his father's residence. Emilie Jung's continuing bouts of absence and depression deeply troubled her son and caused him to associate women with \"innate unreliability\", whereas \"father\" meant for him reliability but also powerlessness. In his memoir, Jung would remark that this parental influence was the \"handicap I started off with. Later, these early impressions were revised: I have trusted men friends and been disappointed by them, and I have mistrusted women and was not disappointed.\" After three years of living in Laufen, Paul Jung requested a transfer; he was called to , next to Basel in 1879. The relocation brought Emilie Jung closer into contact with her family and lifted her melancholy. When he was nine years old, Jung's sister Johanna Gertrud (1884–1935) was born. Known in the family as \"Trudi\", she later became a secretary to her brother.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\n\nNo, I don't know for the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, Carl Jung lived from 1875 to 1961.", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "The contexts do not provide the specific years Carl Jung was alive.

Known food items include schooling forage fish such as mackerel and herring, benthic fishes such as hake and whiting, larger pelagic fishes such as lancetfish and small billfish, squid such as lycoteuthids and ommastrephids, and possibly crab megalopae. They likely use their long tails to stun their prey prior to capture, as they are often found hooked by their tails on longlines and with the bait fish in their stomachs. The shape of their eye sockets give them binocular vision in an upward direction to better aim their strikes. In the Mediterranean, they are strongly associated with schools of frigate mackerel (\"Auxis rochei\"), suggesting that these sharks follow concentrations of their prey from place to place. It is said that the bigeye thresher uses its long tail to smack down birds.\n\n[2] Bigeye thresher: The eyes of the bigeye thresher can measure up to across in adults. Each eye is taller than wide, with a bulbous upper portion. The orbits extend onto the dorsal surface of the head, allowing the eyes to orient upwards. There are also a pair of distinctive lateral grooves that extend from above the eyes to over the gill slits, giving it a \"helmet\"-like appearance. The snout is moderately long and bulbous, and there are no labial furrows at the corners of the mouth. The teeth are moderately large with a single, narrow cusp. There are 19–24 teeth in the upper jaw and 20–24 teeth in the lower jaw; their shapes are similar in both jaws. There are large and small dermal denticles, with the smaller ones more numerous and interspersed amongst the larger ones. The smaller denticles taper to a point.\n\n[3] Common thresher: The common thresher (\"Alopias vulpinus\"), also known by many names such as Atlantic thresher, big-eye thresher, fox shark, green thresher, swingletail, slasher, swiveltail, thintail thresher, whip-tailed shark and Zorro thresher shark, is the largest species of thresher shark, family Alopiidae, reaching some in length. About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin. With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common thresher resembles (and has often been confused with) the pelagic thresher (\"A. pelagicus\"). It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins. The common thresher is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, though it prefers cooler temperatures. It can be found both close to shore and in the open ocean, from the surface to a depth of . It is seasonally migratory and spends summers at lower latitudes.\n\n[4] Common thresher: The long tail of the common thresher, the source of many fanciful tales through history, is used in a whip-like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey. This species feeds mainly on small schooling forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies. It is a fast, strong swimmer that has been known to leap clear of the water, and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water. The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction, with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother. Females typically give birth to four pups at a time, following a gestation period of nine months.\n\n[5] Threshers, pedal powered: The size and weight of the thresher can be problematic. The thresher may need to be carried, and therefore must be light enough for one person. The suggested weight is 35 kg. On hillside farms it may be difficult to transport the thresher or to set it up properly.\n\n[6] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating). This enzyme participates in lysine degradation and L-carnitine biosynthesis and requires the presence of iron and ascorbate.\n\n[7] Thresher shark: Named for their exceptionally long, thresher-like heterocercal tail or \"caudal fins\" (which can be as long as the total body length), thresher sharks are active predators; the tail is used as a weapon to stun prey. The thresher shark has a short head and a cone-shaped nose. The mouth is generally small, and the teeth range in size from small to large. By far the largest of the three species is the common thresher, \"Alopias vulpinus\", which may reach a length of and a weight of over . The bigeye thresher, \"Alopias superciliosus\", is next in size, reaching a length of 4.9 m (16 ft); at just 3 m (10 ft), the pelagic thresher, \"Alopias pelagicus\", is the smallest.\n\n[8] Bigeye thresher: There is conflicting evidence on whether the bigeye thresher is warm-bodied like the common thresher (\"A. vulpinus\"). In a 1971 study, Carey \"et al.\" probed the swimming muscles of two bigeye threshers with a thermistor needle and reported finding a temperature elevation of 1.8 and 4.3 °C (3.8 and 9.1 °F) compared to the ambient environment. However, an anatomical examination conducted by Sepulveda \"et al.\" in 2005 found that though the bigeye thresher possesses the aerobic red muscles responsible for generating heat in the common thresher, these muscles are arranged in two strips along the flanks just beneath the skin, as opposed to near the core of the body. There is also no blood vessel countercurrent exchange system (the rete mirabile) in the trunk to limit the loss of metabolic heat to the water. Based on these differences, the authors questioned earlier measurements and concluded it was unlikely that the bigeye thresher maintains an elevated body temperature. The bigeye thresher does possess a highly developed rete system around its brain and eyes. This is thought to function in buffering those sensitive organs against temperature changes during the shark's daily migrations up and down the water column, which can be as much as 15–16 °C (27–29 °F).\n\n[9] Pelagic thresher: The pelagic thresher is the smallest of the thresher sharks, typically 3 m (10 ft) in length and 69.5 kg (153.3 lb) in weight, and usually not exceeding 3.3 m (10.8 ft) and 88.4 kg (194.9 lb). Males and females attain known maximum lengths of 3.5 m (11.5 ft) and 3.8 m (12.5 ft), respectively. A record of 5 m (16.4 ft) is dubious and may have resulted from confusion with other thresher species. This species has a fusiform body (wide in the middle and tapered at the ends) and a very slender upper caudal fin lobe nearly as long as the rest of the shark. The pectoral fins are long and straight with broad, rounded tips. The first dorsal fin is placed halfway between the pectoral and pelvic fins, and is of comparable size to the pelvic fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny.\n\n[10] Tensta Konsthall: Recent exhibitions at Tensta konsthall include • “Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies,” with Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Goldin+Senneby, Wade Guyton, Mai-Thu Perret, Walid Raad, and Haegue Yang, among others • “Kami, Khokha, Bert and Ernie: World Heritage” by Hinrich Sachs • “Doing what you want: Marie-Louise Ekman accompanied by Sister Corita Kent, Mladen Stilinović, and Martha Wilson” • “The Society without qualities” with Sören Andreasen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Sture Johannesson, Sharon Lockhardt, and Palle Nielsen (part of “The new model” and curated by Lars Bang Larsen) • “Working With...” by Zak Kyes • “We are continuing BBDG” with Bernd Krauss • “Two Archives” by Babak Afrassiabi and Nasrin Tabatabai\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\nNo, answer is not present in the other contexts.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

A TV tie-in of the second book \"Flawless\" featuring an altered Season 3 poster was released on December 28, 2012.\n\n[2] Sara Shepard: Shepard's book series \"Pretty Little Liars\" and \"The Lying Game\" have both been turned into television series by ABC Family (now under the name of Freeform). The \"Pretty Little Liars\" series of novels is \"loosely based on her experiences growing up in Chester County. The adaptation television series \"Pretty Little Liars\" lasted for 7 seasons. It also had a short-lived spin-off starring cast member Tyler Blackburn as Caleb Rivers, entitled \"Ravenswood\". Actresses Troian Bellisario, Ashley Benson, Shay Mitchell, and Lucy Hale star as the main characters Spencer Hastings, Hanna Marin, Emily Fields and Aria Montgomery. Shepard had a cameo on two episodes of the show: \"The Homecoming Hangover\" and \"I'm a Good Girl, I Am\".\n\n[3] Pretty Little Liars (book series): Courtney DiLaurentis: Alison is really Courtney in the books. She used to be sweet, until she started pretending to be her twin, where her personality morphed into her. She is the third child to Jessica and Kenneth and was sent to The Preserve at Addison-Stevens after a physical argument with Alison who she eventually turned into and befriended the Liars up until the night of her infamous disappearance when she was killed and buried by the real Alison DiLaurentis and her accomplice Nick Maxwell. A: A is the main antagonist of the series, being, for the most part, an anonymous character who relentlessly torments many characters, in particular the Liars. Mona Vanderwaal, Alison DiLaurentis and Nick Maxwell are discovered to be A. Mona became A due to Alison and the Liars being responsible for The Jenna Thing, which burned her too. However, she is killed when Spencer pushes her off a cliff face and her neck is caught between rocks. However, a new \"A\" rises, this time even more determined to hurt the Liars. This A is revealed to be Alison herself who wanted revenge on the Liars for ruining her life and Nick, who is revealed to be her accomplice.\n\n[4] Sara Shepard: On September 27, 2017, it was announced that Shephard’s 2014 book series \"The Perfectionists\" would be as a sequel to the series \"Pretty Little Liars\" which will air on Freeform. Sasha Pieterse and Janel Parrish have confirmed to reprise their role as Alison DiLaurentis and Mona Vanderwaal. Sofia Carson, Sydney Park, Eli Brown and Kelly Rutherford have confirmed to be cast in \"Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists\", as Ava Jalali, Caitlin Martell-Lewis, Dylan Wright and Claire Hotchkiss, respectively. Moreover, Hayley Erin has committed to the show but her character is kept in mystery. If picked up for a series order by Freeform, the show will release in 2019.\n\n[5] Pretty Little Liars (novel): Pretty Little Liars is the first book in the \"Pretty Little Liars\" series by Sara Shepard. It tells the story of four girls - Hanna, Aria, Emily and Spencer - after the disappearance of their clique leader, Alison. The book was written for the book packaging company Alloy Entertainment, the idea originally developed as a TV series.\n\n[6] Pretty Little Liars (season 1): Originally developed as a television series by book packaging company Alloy Entertainment, the idea was described as \"\"Desperate Housewives\" for teens.\" Alloy met with author Shepard, and gave her the property to develop into a book series. With Alloy and Warner Horizon interested in producing a \"Pretty Little Liars\" television series for years, it was first planned for The WB in 2005 with a different writer. The first novel was published by HarperTeen in October 2006. In June 2008, Alloy noted that it was developing a \"Pretty Little Liars\" television pilot for ABC Family. The novels are being adapted for television by I. Marlene King.\n\n[7] Pretty Little Liars (book series): The series is loosely divided into four arcs, chronicling the introduction and reveal of each \"A\". Set in the suburbs of Philadelphia, the series follows the lives of four teenage girls nicknamed \"the Pretty little Liars\" or simply \"the Liars\", whose clique falls apart after the disappearance of their Queen bee leader, \"Alison DiLaurentis\". A year after her disappearance, the girls begin receiving threatening messages from an anonymous character named \"A,\" who threatens to expose their secrets, including long-hidden ones they thought only Alison knew. Shortly after the messages begin, Alison's body is discovered buried in her yard. The books progress with the four girls trying to figure out the identity of \"A\" and facing many dangerous obstacles and twists as they do so.\n\n[8] Emily Fields: \"Pretty Little Liars\" is a series of novels which follows the lives of four teenage girls nicknamed the Pretty little Liars or simply the Liars, whose clique falls apart after the disappearance of their queen bee leader, Alison DiLaurentis.

The marriage does not seem to have lasted, and Betsey Chamberlain did not use the name \"Wright\" in later years. According to Harriet Hanson Robinson, who started work in the Lowell mills as a child of ten in 1835, \"Mrs. Chamberlain was a widow, and came to Lowell with three children from some 'community' (probably the Shakers), where she had not been contented. She had inherited Indian blood, and was proud of it. She had long, straight black hair, and walked very erect, with great freedom of movement. One of her sons was afterwards connected with the \"New York Tribune\".\"\n\n[2] ᄑ: ᄑ is one of the Korean hangul. The Unicode for ᄑ is U+314D.\n\n[3] Wilt Chamberlain: Wilton Norman Chamberlain (; August 21, 1936 – October 12, 1999) was an American basketball player who played center position and is considered one of the most prominent and dominant players in NBA history. He played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors, the Philadelphia 76ers, and the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played for the University of Kansas and also for the Harlem Globetrotters before playing in the NBA. Chamberlain stood tall, and weighed as a rookie before bulking up to 275 and eventually to over with the Lakers.\n\n[4] Wilt Chamberlain: Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born in Philadelphia, into a family of nine children, the son of Olivia Ruth Johnson, a domestic worker and homemaker, and William Chamberlain, a welder, custodian, and handyman. He was a frail child, nearly dying of pneumonia in his early years and missing a whole year of school as a result. In his early years Chamberlain was not interested in basketball, because he thought it was \"a game for sissies\". Instead, he was an avid track and field athlete: as a youth, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and broad jumped 22 feet. But according to Chamberlain, \"basketball was king in Philadelphia\", so he eventually turned to the sport. Because Chamberlain was a very tall child, already measuring at age 10 and when he entered Philadelphia's Overbrook High School, he had a natural advantage against his peers; he soon was renowned for his scoring talent, his physical strength and his shot blocking abilities. According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock, Chamberlain was \"scary, flat-out frightening... before he came along, most basketball players were mortal-sized men. Chamberlain changed that.\" It was also in this period of his life when his three lifelong nicknames \"Wilt the Stilt\", \"Goliath\",\n\n[5] Trimethyllysine dioxygenase: This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6,N6,N6-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include trimethyllysine alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML-alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, TML hydroxylase, 6-N,6-N,6-N-trimethyl-L-lysine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase, and (3-hydroxylating).

In December 1917, Norman Chamberlain was reported missing in action during the Battle of Cambrai, and in February 1918, Norman's body was found—a great blow to Neville Chamberlain, who described Norman as \"the most intimate friend I had\". Through the rest of his career, Neville Chamberlain laboured to further the ideals of his cousin, and wrote his biography—the only book he ever wrote. Some historians relate Norman's death to a hatred of war on his cousin's part which led to appeasement; according to Chamberlain's biographer Nick Smart, the death did not cause Chamberlain to hate World War I, and any influence on his later positions is far from certain.\n\n[9] Tensta Konsthall: Recent exhibitions at Tensta konsthall include • “Abstract Possible: The Stockholm Synergies,” with Doug Ashford, Claire Barclay, Goldin+Senneby, Wade Guyton, Mai-Thu Perret, Walid Raad, and Haegue Yang, among others • “Kami, Khokha, Bert and Ernie: World Heritage” by Hinrich Sachs • “Doing what you want: Marie-Louise Ekman accompanied by Sister Corita Kent, Mladen Stilinović, and Martha Wilson” • “The Society without qualities” with Sören Andreasen, Ane Hjort Guttu, Sture Johannesson, Sharon Lockhardt, and Palle Nielsen (part of “The new model” and curated by Lars Bang Larsen) • “Working With...” by Zak Kyes • “We are continuing BBDG” with Bernd Krauss • “Two Archives” by Babak Afrassiabi and Nasrin Tabatabai\n\n[10] Brickell World Plaza: \"We designed the building from the inside out, not the outside in,” said Loretta H.

A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the Earth's position in the Solar System; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11, and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the \"century rule\" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox.\n\n[2] Hebrew calendar: The postponement of the year is compensated for by adding a day to the second month or removing one from the third month. A Jewish common year can only have 353, 354, or 355 days. A leap year is always 30 days longer, and so can have 383, 384, or 385 days.Whether a year is deficient, regular, or complete is determined by the time between two adjacent Rosh Hashanah observances and the leap year. While the \"keviyah\" is sufficient to describe a year, a variant specifies the day of the week for the first day of Pesach (Passover) in lieu of the year length.\n\n[3] Leap year: Over a period of four centuries, the accumulated error of adding a leap day \"every\" four years amounts to about three extra days. The Gregorian calendar therefore drops three leap days every 400 years, which is the length of its \"leap cycle\". This is done by dropping February 29 in the three century years (multiples of 100) that cannot be exactly divided by 400. The years 1600, 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200 and 2300 are common years. By this rule, the average number of days per year is 365 + − + = 365.2425. The rule can be applied to years before the Gregorian reform (the proleptic Gregorian calendar), if astronomical year numbering is used. The Gregorian calendar was designed to keep the vernal equinox on or close to March 21, so that the date of Easter (celebrated on the Sunday after the ecclesiastical full moon that falls on or after March 21) remains close to the vernal equinox. The \"Accuracy\" section of the \"Gregorian calendar\" article discusses how well the Gregorian calendar achieves this design goal, and how well it approximates the tropical year.\n\n[4] Calendar year: The Gregorian year, which is in use in most of the world, begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. It has a length of 365 days in an ordinary year, with 8,760 hours, 525,600 minutes, or 31,536,000 seconds; but 366 days in a leap year, with 8,784 hours, 527,040 minutes, or 31,622,400 seconds. With 97 leap years every 400 years, the year has an average length of 365.2425 days. Other formula-based calendars can have lengths which are further out of step with the solar cycle: for example, the Julian calendar has an average length of 365.25 days, and the Hebrew calendar has an average length of 365.2468 days. The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 months in a year of 354 or 355 days.\n\n[5] Hebrew calendar: In calculating the number of months that will have passed since the known molad that one uses as the starting point, one must remember to include any leap months that falls within the elapsed interval, according to the cycle of leap years. A 19-year cycle of 235 synodic months has 991 weeks 2 days 16 hours 595 parts, a common year of 12 synodic months has 50 weeks 4 days 8 hours 876 parts, while a leap year of 13 synodic months has 54 weeks 5 days 21 hours 589 parts.\n\n[6] Thomas Fuller (mental calculator): First, when they asked him how many seconds there were in a year and a half, he answered in about two minutes, 47,304,000. Second, when they asked how many seconds a man has lived who is 70 years, 17 days and 12 hours old, he answered in a minute and a half 2,210,500,800. One of the men was working out the problems on paper, and informed Fuller that he was wrong, because the answer was much smaller. Fuller hastily replied, \"'Top, massa, you forget de leap year.\" When the leap year was added in, the sums matched.\n\n[7] Year: In the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is intercalated into the month of February. The name \"Leap Day\" is applied to the added day.\n\n[8] Revised Julian calendar: In 900 Julian years there are = 225 leap days. The Revised Julian leap rule omits seven of nine century leap years, leaving leap days per 900-year cycle. Thus the calendar mean year is 365 + days, but this is actually a double-cycle that reduces to 365 + = 365.24 days, or exactly 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 48 seconds, which is exactly 24 seconds shorter than the Gregorian mean year of 365.2425 days, so in the long term on \"average\" the Revised Julian calendar pulls ahead of the Gregorian calendar by one day in 3600 years.\n\n[9] Tabular Islamic calendar: In its most common form there are 11 leap years in a 30-year cycle. Noting that the average year has 354 11/30 days and a common year has 354 days, at the end of the first year of the 30-year cycle the remainder is 11/30 day. Whenever the remainder exceeds a half day (15/30 day), then a leap day is added to that year, reducing the remainder by one day. Thus at the end of the second year the remainder would be 22/30 day which is reduced to −8/30 day by a leap day. Using this rule the leap years are of the 30-year cycle. If leap days are added whenever the remainder \"equals\" or exceeds a half day, then all leap years are the same except 15 replaces 16.\n\n[10] Leap year: In the Gregorian calendar, the standard calendar in most of the world, most years that are multiples of 4 are leap years. In each leap year, the month of February has 29 days instead of 28. Adding one extra day in the calendar every four years compensates for the fact that a period of 365 days is shorter than a tropical year by almost 6 hours. Some exceptions to this basic rule are required since the duration of a tropical year is slightly less than 365.25 days. The Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1], [3], [5], [7], [9], and [10].\n\nNo, answer is not present in [2], [4], [6], and [8].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the answer to the question?\n\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\".", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in context [1].", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know\n\nThe contexts do not provide a definitive answer to the number of hours in a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.

These include George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949), where it is used as a snippet of nursery rhyme which embodies the forgotten past that protagonist Winston Smith yearns for. Various characters contribute snippets of the rhyme as the book goes on, and the last lines figure symbolically into the closing events of the second section. A setting of the full \"Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book\" version for choir was written by Bob Chilcott. Entitled \"London Bells\", it is the third movement of \"Songs and Cries of London Town\". Benjamin Till composed music based upon the nursery rhyme and it was performed in 2009 at St Mary Le Bow Church, London to honour 150 years of the great bell, Big Ben. In the dystopian future of the video game \"Half-Life 2\" (2004), oranges and lemons can be seen in graffiti on walls as symbols of the Resistance. This is a reference to the poem as it was used in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". In Neil Gaiman's \"The Graveyard Book\" (2008), two lesser villains recite the rhyme to summon the man Jack. In the 1963 horror-comedy The Old Dark House, part of the rhyme is heard in a tape recording played backwards while trying to discover the identity of the secret killer. In the film \"It\" (2017), it is used as background music throughout the\n\n[2] Oranges and Lemons: In Doctor Who, revival series 6, episode 11 \"The God Complex\" (Air date: September 17, 2011), the character called Joe \"quotes the finale of old English nursery rhyme 'Oranges and Lemons,' singing 'Here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop off your head!,' which echoes a moment in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where Winston Smith uses a snatch of the same rhyme to remind him of a forgotten and innocent past.\" In Ellen Raskin's Book, The Tattooed Potato and Other Clues, the protagonist, Dickory Dock, has a pocket watch that plays this nursery rhyme, and the song forms a major part of the storyline.\n\n[3] Oranges and Lemons: Oranges and Lemons was the name of a square-four-eight-dance, published in Playford's, \"Dancing Master\" in 1665, but it is not clear if this relates to this rhyme. Similar rhymes naming churches and giving rhymes to their names can be found in other parts of England, including Shropshire and Derby, where they were sung on festival days, on which bells would also have been rung.\n\n[4] The Belles of St. Lemons: The title of the series was both a play on the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\" and Ronald Searle's Belles of St. Trinians cartoons.\n\n[5] Smithfield, London: Smithfield and its Market, situated mostly in the parish of St Sepulchre, was founded in 1137, and was endowed by Prior Rahere, who also founded St Barts. The ancient parish of St Sepulchre extended north to Turnmill Street, to St Paul's Cathedral and Ludgate Hill in the south, and along the east bank of the Fleet (now the route of Farringdon Street). St Sepulchre's Tower contains the twelve \"bells of Old Bailey\", referred to in the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\". Traditionally, the Great Bell was rung to announce the execution of a prisoner at Newgate.\n\n[6] Oranges &amp; Lemons (album): Oranges & Lemons is the 11th studio album and the second double album by the English band XTC, released 27 February 1989 on Virgin Records. It is the follow-up to 1986's \"Skylarking\". The title (derived from the nursery rhyme of the same name) was chosen in reference to the band's poor financial standing at the time, while the music is characterised as a 1980s update of 1960s psychedelia. It received critical acclaim and became the band's highest-charting album since 1982's \"English Settlement\", rising to number 28 in the UK and number 44 in the US.\n\n[7] St Clement's, Eastcheap: St Clement Eastcheap considers itself to be the church referred to in the nursery rhyme that begins \"Oranges and lemons / Say the bells of St Clement's\". So too does St Clement Danes Church, Westminster, whose bells ring out the traditional tune of the nursery rhyme three times a day.\n\n[8] Oranges and Lemons: \"Oranges and Lemons\" is a traditional English nursery rhyme, folksong, and singing game which refers to the bells of several churches, all within or close to the City of London. It is listed in the Roud Folk Song Index as No 13190.\n\n[9] The Bells of Rhymney: The lyrics to the song were drawn from part of Davies' poetic work \"Gwalia Deserta\", which was first published in 1938. The work was inspired by a local coal mining disaster and by the failure of the 1926 General Strike, with the \"Bells of Rhymney\" stanzas following the pattern of the nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\". In addition to Rhymney, the poem also refers to the bells of a number of other places in South Wales, including Merthyr, Rhondda, Blaina, Caerphilly, Neath, Brecon, Swansea, Newport, Cardiff, and the Wye Valley.\n\n[10] Oranges &amp; Lemons (album): A working title for the album was \"Songs of Sixpence\". \"Oranges & Lemons\" derives from the traditional English nursery rhyme of the same name, previously referenced in the opening lyric of \"Ballet for a Rainy Day\" from \"Skylarking\". Partridge interpreted the nursery rhyme to be about financial debt and said that the title \"sort of, in a bizarre way, describes California as well.\" He said, \"It was not an LA album musically so much, but an LA album in kind of sunshine and citrus fruits, and it plugged me straight into the pop art vibe.\" Asked for likes or dislikes about Los Angeles, he responded: \"I hate the sunshine. All of that constant sunshine drives me up the wall. I like mysterious weather. I think it rained one day and it was so wonderful.\" Although he had been a fan of Pink Floyd since his youth, the title was not meant as a reference to their 1967 single \"Apples and Oranges\".\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "I don't know.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease respond with \"Yes, answer is present\" or \"I don't know\" based on the contexts provided.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know the question?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nThe question asked by the 'Bells of Old Bailey' in the nursery rhyme 'Oranges and Lemons' is \"Here comes a candle to light you to bed", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

Linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century, when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra. The development of computers led to increased research in efficient algorithms for Gaussian elimination and matrix decompositions, and linear algebra became an essential tool for modelling and simulations.\n\n[2] Abstract algebra: Numerous textbooks in abstract algebra start with axiomatic definitions of various algebraic structures and then proceed to establish their properties. This creates a false impression that in algebra axioms had come first and then served as a motivation and as a basis of further study. The true order of historical development was almost exactly the opposite. For example, the hypercomplex numbers of the nineteenth century had kinematic and physical motivations but challenged comprehension. Most theories that are now recognized as parts of algebra started as collections of disparate facts from various branches of mathematics, acquired a common theme that served as a core around which various results were grouped, and finally became unified on a basis of a common set of concepts. An archetypical example of this progressive synthesis can be seen in the history of group theory.\n\n[3] History of algebra: In addition to the three stages of expressing algebraic ideas, some authors recognized four conceptual stages in the development of algebra that occurred alongside the changes in expression. These four stages were as follows:The origins of algebra can be traced to the ancient Babylonians, who developed a positional number system that greatly aided them in solving their rhetorical algebraic equations. The Babylonians were not interested in exact solutions but approximations, and so they would commonly use linear interpolation to approximate intermediate values. One of the most famous tablets is the Plimpton 322 tablet, created around 1900–1600 BC, which gives a table of Pythagorean triples and represents some of the most advanced mathematics prior to Greek mathematics.\n\n[4] Algebraic logic: Modern mathematical logic began in 1847, with two pamphlets whose respective authors were George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. In 1870 Charles Sanders Peirce published the first of several works on the logic of relatives, and in 1883, Christine Ladd, a student of Peirce at Johns Hopkins University, published \"On the Algebra of Logic\". Logic turned more algebraic when binary relations were combined with composition of relations. For sets \"A\" and \"B\", relations were first understood as elements of the power set of \"A\"×\"B\" with properties described by Boolean algebra. The \"calculus of relations\" is arguably the culmination of Leibniz's approach to logic. At the Hochschule Karlsruhe the calculus of relations was described by Ernst Schröder. In particular he formulated Schröder rules, though De Morgan had anticipated them with his Theorem K.\n\n[5] Algebraic geometry: Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on \"intrinsic\" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, differential and complex geometry. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles' proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach.\n\n[6] Computer algebra: At the beginning of computer algebra, circa 1970, when the long-known algorithms were first put on computers, they turned out to be highly inefficient. Therefore, a large part of the work of the researchers in the field consisted in revisiting classical algebra in order to make it effective and to discover efficient algorithms to implement this effectiveness. A typical example of this kind of work is the computation of polynomial greatest common divisors, which is required to simplify fractions. Surprisingly, the classical Euclid's algorithm turned out to be inefficient for polynomials over infinite fields, and thus new algorithms needed to be developed. The same was also true for the classical algorithms from linear algebra.For a detailed definition of the subject: For textbooks devoted to the subject:\n\n[7] Algebra: François Viète's work on new algebra at the close of the 16th century was an important step towards modern algebra. In 1637, René Descartes published \"La Géométrie\", inventing analytic geometry and introducing modern algebraic notation. Another key event in the further development of algebra was the general algebraic solution of the cubic and quartic equations, developed in the mid-16th century. The idea of a determinant was developed by Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa in the 17th century, followed independently by Gottfried Leibniz ten years later, for the purpose of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations using matrices. Gabriel Cramer also did some work on matrices and determinants in the 18th century. Permutations were studied by Joseph-Louis Lagrange in his 1770 paper \"Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations\" devoted to solutions of algebraic equations, in which he introduced Lagrange resolvents. Paolo Ruffini was the first person to develop the theory of permutation groups, and like his predecessors, also in the context of solving algebraic equations.\n\n[8] Algebra: Abstract algebra was developed in the 19th century, deriving from the interest in solving equations, initially focusing on what is now called Galois theory, and on constructibility issues. George Peacock was the founder of axiomatic thinking in arithmetic and algebra. Augustus De Morgan discovered relation algebra in his \"Syllabus of a Proposed System of Logic\". Josiah Willard Gibbs developed an algebra of vectors in three-dimensional space, and Arthur Cayley developed an algebra of matrices (this is a noncommutative algebra).\n\n[9] Geometric algebra: Also developed are the concept of vector manifold and geometric integration theory (which generalizes Cartan's differential forms).Although the connection of geometry with algebra dates as far back at least to Euclid's \"Elements\" in the third century B.C. (see Greek geometric algebra), GA in the sense used in this article was not developed until 1844, when it was used in a \"systematic way\" to describe the geometrical properties and \"transformations\" of a space. In that year, Hermann Grassmann introduced the idea of a geometrical algebra in full generality as a certain calculus (analogous to the propositional calculus) that encoded all of the geometrical information of a space. Grassmann's algebraic system could be applied to a number of different kinds of spaces, the chief among them being Euclidean space, affine space, and projective space. Following Grassmann, in 1878 William Kingdon Clifford examined Grassmann's algebraic system alongside the quaternions of William Rowan Hamilton in . From his point of view, the quaternions described certain \"transformations\" (which he called \"rotors\"), whereas Grassmann's algebra described certain \"properties\" (or \"Strecken\" such as length, area, and volume). His contribution was to define a new product — the \"geometric product\" – on an existing Grassmann algebra, which realized the quaternions as living within that algebra. Subsequent\n\n[10] Geometric algebra: The geometric product was first briefly mentioned by Hermann Grassmann, who was chiefly interested in developing the closely related exterior algebra. In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford greatly expanded on Grassmann's work to form what are now usually called Clifford algebras in his honor (although Clifford himself chose to call them \"geometric algebras\"). For several decades, geometric algebras went somewhat ignored, greatly eclipsed by the vector calculus then newly developed to describe electromagnetism. The term \"geometric algebra\" was repopularized in the 1960s by Hestenes, who advocated its importance to relativistic physics.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

He remained true to form for what were to be his final years of film making, and his next feature went into production in 1995; \"Les deux orphelines vampires\" (\"The Two Orphan Vampires\") saw the return of his most recognizable work, and his first vampire film since 1975's \"Levres de sang\". With the then recent increase in popularity of Rollin's works, and with the resurgence with the vampire genre in general, most notable with \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\", this prompted Rollin to create a new vampire feature, quite different from Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 blockbuster, as he stated that it was \"not a good film at all\", and that \"it just doesn't work for one second\". The idea of the film was based upon Rollin's novel of the same name and went into production in June 1995 for a mere ₣3,000,000, which is actually more than his prior works received. Locations for the shoot included four days in New York at the beginning, with the remaining three weeks in Paris. Cinematography was provided by Norbert Marfaing-Sintes, who previously worked with Italian director Duccio Tessari, as Max Monteillet was not available. Nathalie Perrey introduced Rollin to Marfaing-Sintes, as she had experience working with Marfaing-Sintes in many films;\n\n[2] Jean Rollin: Rollin directed the adult sex films \"Jeunes filles impudiques\" (\"Schoolgirl Hitchhikers\"), \"Le sourire vertical\" (\"The Vertical Smile\"), and \"Tout le monde il en a deux\" (\"Bacchanales sexuelles\" or \"Fly Me the French Way\") under the pseudonym Michel Gentil as he was financially unable to come up with a budget for another mainstream feature film. However, in 1974 Rollin directed the horror adventure and self-proclaimed \"Expressionist\" film \"Les démoniaques\" which was inspired by the adventure classics he had enormous admiration for in his youth. The film includes Joëlle Cœur and Willy Braque whom Rollin worked with on \"Jeunes filles impudiques\". The story follows two young women who have been involved in a shipwreck and are brutally raped and murdered by a group of rogue pirates, only to be resurrected after making love to the devil so that they can seek their revenge. Rollin had many disputes with the producers of the film during production of the project as they insisted on a low budget. He was hospitalized for two weeks following the work due to mental and physical exhaustion. Further problems would arise including the working title, \"Les diablesses\", having to be changed as the copyright was not free of charge and with the Castel Twins being unavailable for the roles of the avenging ghosts, the parts where offered to inexperienced \n\n[3] Jean Rollin: The film includes pornographic actress Brigitte Lahaie, in her first mainstream role, as Rollin was the first French director to recognise her acting capabilities and offer her much more prominent roles in his subsequent films. Rollin stated that \"Les raisins de la mort\" was his \"first traditional, almost conventional, production\" which was because the film acquired solid finances with made a change and with special effects supplied by Italian experts. Claude Becognee served as director of photography which added to the film's success. Rollin would credit much of the film's success to Marie-Georges Pascal's portrayal of Elisabeth, whom he would recall delivered a very \"moving\" performance in the film. \"Les raisins de la mort\" was shot in the deserted mountain region of Les Cévennes.\n\n[4] Jean Rollin: Jean Michel Rollin Roth Le Gentil (3 November 193815 December 2010) was a French film director, actor, and novelist best known for his work in the fantastique genre.\n\n[5] Jean Rollin: Between 1976 and 1977, his work consisted strictly of hardcore pornographic films as there was a lack of money and producers reluctant to fund any new mainstream projects due to his previous commercial failures. Seven porn films were produced within this period under his pseudonym Michel Gentil, and one of which, \"Suce moi vampire\" (\"Suck Me Vampire\": the hardcore version of \"Lèvres de sang\"), he credited himself as Michel Gand. His 1976 hardcore film \"Douces pénétraitions\" marked the final time the Castel Twins would appear together working for Rollin, and the final time Marie-Pierre would work with him altogether. Catherine would continue to appear in his films for several years.\n\n[6] Jean Rollin: Despite his intentions to retire from directing following \"Perdues dans New York\", his final film of the 1980s, \"Killing Car\" (working title \"Femme dangereuse\") was produced in 1989. It is a revenge thriller and one of his most underrated and overlooked works. Initially intended to be a softcore production under the Michel Gentil pseudonym, Rollin attached his own name to the project and made it one of his most personal and self-referential of all his works. The film was shot on 16mm and in less than a week on a minimal budget of under $100,000. Australian model Tiki Tsang, originally of Brisbane, Queensland, had been residing in Paris, France for sometime when she was discovered by Rollin and offered her the role of \"The Car Woman\", a strange woman who steals an old Buick and proceeds to kill a number of people to seek revenge for a past tragedy. The part of \"The Car Woman\" was written especially for Tsang in what is the only film credit to her name. \"Killing Car\" gives nod to previous Rollin works including Tsang emerging from a grandfather clock (as did Dominique in an iconic scene from \"Les frisson des vampires\"). Max Monteillet returned as cinematographer and Philippe Brejean provided the score. Cast includes recurring collaborators Jean-Pierre Bouyxou and Jean-Loup Philippe. Following the production, Rollin was hospitalized due to exhaustion and started editing the film after his recovery. The \n\n[7] Jean Rollin: In 1968, Jean directed his first feature Le Viol du Vampire (\"The Rape of the Vampire\"). At the time he was still not known in the world of cinema, having only done a few short films and documentaries. The film was shot on a low budget, and consisted of two parts because it was originally intended to be another short film; the second part was later added so that it was released as a feature film. The release of \"Le Viol\" caused public scandal and outrage, his strong inspiration of American serials did not attract viewers. It was released during the events of May 1968, and due to the riots, it was a rare theatrical production at the time. Rollin himself was also threatened due to this scandal, because of this, he briefly decided to give up making films.\n\n[8] Jean Rollin: In 1981, Rollin returned with the drama film, \"Les paumées du petit matin\" (\"The Escapees\" or \"The Runaways\"). It marks a departure to the usual horror tones which his films are notable for, and here mixes drama with elements of adventure, thriller and crime, while maintaining erotic and poetic themes and remains a distinctive and unique piece of work from Rollin. The story follows two young women who are confined to mental asylum in the countryside; Michelle (Laurence Dubas), a troubled teenager, has been returned to the asylum after escaping and is forced into a straitjacket. She manages to get the attention of Marie (Christiane Coppé), a teenage girl who is who sits in the garden on a rocking chair, while staring into space and never speaks, by dropping a tin food dish from her bedroom window and the sound somehow brings Marie back to reality. They escape from the asylum and encounter a group of burlesque dancers, a bar singer and a group of women who proceed to rape Marie. Their journey ends when they become involved in crime and death. The cast includes Rollin's usual collaborators Louise Dhour, Nathalie Perrey, Brigitte Lahie and a cameo appearance from Rollin himself. \"Les paumées du petit matin\" unfortunately failed to receive a proper theatrical in 1981 which resulted in it being one of the most difficult Rollin films\n\n[9] Jean Rollin filmography: Jean Rollin (born Jean Michel Rollin Roth Le Gentil; 3 November 1938 – 15 December 2010) was a French film director, writer, producer, actor and novelist. He worked on his mainstream films under his own name and on pornographic and several other films under the pseudonyms Michel Gentil or J.A. Laser. He has additionally served as an editor, assistant director, executive producer, production and film supervisor on several other projects throughout his career.\n\n[10] Jean Rollin: Rollin received minor work following \"Les trottoirs de Bangkok\"; in 1985, he resumed his pseudonym work as Michel Gentil in a non-pornographic feature, the slapstick comedy, \"Ne prends pas les poulets pour des pigeons\" which reunited Brigitte Borghese and Gérard Landry from his previous film, and included French actor and comedian Popeck. Rollin was hired for the work and therefore his real name was not attached to the project. In 1988, he received the uncredited directorial role in the erotic sequel \"Emmanuelle 6\", in which he also served as screenplay writer. The film suffered many flaws during production under direction from Bruno Zincone and Rollin became involved in an attempt to salvage what he could and see that production was completed for the financiers.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present in [1].\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, Jean Rollin's first film was \"Le Viol du Vampire\" (\"The Rape of the Vampire\").", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "I don't know.", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\nYes, answer is present in context [2].\nNo, answer is not present in context [3].\nYes, answer is present in context [4].\nYes, answer is present", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "I don't know.", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know.

These paint schemes are unique because they are not Factory paint jobs from Ford. The convertible offered a new optional light bar with other options including a one-piece drive shaft and color coordinated billet aluminum engine cap set. The extensive body kit upgrades included a revised front fascia, side rockers with brake ducts, rear bumper, and decklid. New taillights and custom Shelby GT350 badges further distinguish this special model and bring back memories of past models. The serialized dash plate with individual numbering for each GT350 produced was also included. The 2012 Shelby GT350 delivers the same performance numbers as the 2011 model. The addition of a Whipple supercharger and Borla exhaust system have really allowed this V8 to take on a life of its own. An automatic transmission was optional with the naturally aspirated engine. Keeping the powerful engine under control was an upgraded suspension system designed by Shelby to give the Mustang a reduced body roll and more variability to create custom track setups. Custom ERADISPEED rear rotors in conjunction with Bear 6-piston brakes were also included in the package.\n\n[2] Shelby Mustang: The GTs lost their Cobra tag for 1969, and once again were marketed simply as the Shelby GT350 and Shelby GT500. The GT350 and GT500 for the 1969 model year received an extensive face lift, the body alone increasing in length by with some reaching . Ford was involved with design and style decisions, with Shelby having little input. The GT350 was now equipped with a 351 cubic-inch V8. Carroll Shelby terminated his agreement with Ford in the summer of 1969.\n\n[3] Shelby Mustang: The 1967 redesign made for a heavier Mustang, along with a longer, fiberglass hood, and new front and rear facias. The design of the original 1965 version was evident, but these styling upgrades gave the car a more aggressive appearance and achieved Carroll Shelby's goal of differentiating his car from the Mustang on which it was based. The separate high-beam headlamps in the grille added more character, while a thin, chrome front bumper sat below a mesh grille with the classic \"Shelby GT350\" logo in place (except for the very early cars). The small hood scoop was there to deliver fresh air to the engine. Shelby also included new, horizontal taillights (sourced from a '67 Cougar in 1967 and a '65 Thunderbird in 1968) and an integrated Kamm-type rear spoiler. Functional rear brake-cooling scoops adorned the rear quarter panels. Ten-spoke, fifteen-inch, cast-aluminum rims were the wheel choice with Goodyear white-lettered radials.\n\n[4] Shelby Mustang: Coinciding with the 45th anniversary of the original 1965 Shelby GT350, Shelby American unveiled an all new GT350 Mustang at the opening night gala of the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, AZ. Presented in concept form, the new GT350 had a supercharged version of the brand new 5.0-liter V8 engine in the 2011 Mustang GT as well as performance upgrades from Ford Racing, Borla, Cragar, Baer and more.\n\n[5] Shelby Mustang: The first 252 GT350s for 1966 began as 1965 Mustang K-Code Fastbacks. These cars were specifically ordered by Shelby American for conversion into 1966 GT350s. Upon delivery to Shelby-American, the cars were randomly picked for conversion. The Shelby VINs do not correspond in numerical order with Ford VINs. The Ford VINs were shipped in 'blocks,' but many differ significantly because the order they were taken for conversions.\n\n[6] Shelby Mustang: The 1965 GT350 was not built for comfort or ease of driving. There were 34 \"GT350R\" race-spec cars built specifically for competition use under SCCA rules, and the model was the B-Production champion for three straight years. The 1966 GT350 was more comfortable for casual drivers, including rear seats, optional colors, and an optional automatic transmission. This trend for more options and luxuries continued in the following years, with the cars becoming progressively larger, heavier, and more comfortable, while losing much of their competitiveness in the process. The 1969 GT350s and GT500s were largely styling modifications to a stock Mustang. By 1969 Carroll Shelby was no longer involved in the Shelby GT program, and the design was done in-house by Ford.\n\n[7] Shelby Mustang: All 1965 GT350s were painted Wimbledon White with Guardsman Blue rocker stripes. Very few GT350s were delivered to the dealer with the optional \"Le Mans\" (or \"LeMans\") top stripes, which run the length of the entire car. Approximately 28% of the 562 1965 cars built had Le Mans stripes. Dealers often added the stripes, probably at the customer's request. Today, it is difficult to find a GT350 not so equipped.\n\n[8] Shelby Mustang: No production of 1970 Shelby GT350 and 500 models was undertaken; however, unsold 1969 models were given 1970 vehicle identification numbers under FBI supervision. The 1970 models had two cosmetic changes, a front chin spoiler and two black hood stripes. The rest of the changes had to do with emissions. The GT500 had the carburetor modified and marked \"ed\" (edited) on tag. The distributor in both the GT 350 and GT500 was changed to a 1970 version. A total of 789 were re-VIN'd.\n\n[9] Shelby Mustang: Revealed in 2013 as an upgrade kit for the Mustang GT, the Shelby GT350 (S197 II) was built in limited numbers and was offered in both coupe and convertible versions. For the 2013 model year, the GT350 received new color options, visual styling cues, and optional performance enhancements. The 2013 Shelby GT350 is powered by a 5.0 liter V8 engine offered in either a naturally aspirated version with an optional upgrade to increase the power output to , or a or supercharged versions. The engine could be combined with a manual gearbox with a short throw shifter as standard, or an automatic transmission for the naturally aspirated engine as an option.\n\n[10] Shelby Mustang: The 1965 and 1966 GT350s were delivered from Ford's San Jose Assembly Plant in body in white form for modification by Carroll Shelby's operation, originally in Venice Beach and later at Los Angeles International Airport. San Jose cars carried an \"R\" in the Ford VIN denoting that facility. The only year that Shelby Mustangs from the 1960s came from another plant was 1968, where they came from New Jersey, \"T\" in the VIN, and were modified by A.O. Smith.\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nPlease answer the following question based on the information provided:\n\nWho designed Shelby Mustang GT350?", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Yes, answer is present.

Born in Lomas de Zamora, he was elected for the local legislature and appointed mayor in 1973. He was deposed during the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, and elected again when democracy was restored in 1983 after the tyranny of soldiers raiding homes. He was elected vice-president of Argentina in 1989, under President Carlos Menem.\n\n[2] Economic history of Argentina: In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was appointed president, becoming Argentina's fifth president in two weeks. Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing recovery of the economy, having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a moment when Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation. Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was achieved in part because of a commodity price boom, and also because the government managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.\n\n[3] Raúl Alfonsín: Raúl Ricardo Alfonsín Foulkes (March 12, 1927 – March 31, 2009) was an Argentine lawyer and statesman who served as the President of Argentina from 10 December 1983 to 8 July 1989. Alfonsín was the first democratically elected president after more than seven years of military dictatorship and is considered the \"father of modern democracy in Argentina\". Born in Chascomús, Buenos Aires Province, he began his studies of law at the National University of La Plata and was a graduate of the University of Buenos Aires. He was affiliated with the Radical Civic Union (UCR), joining the faction of Ricardo Balbín after the party split.\n\n[4] Héctor Aldo Fagetti Gallego: Héctor Aldo Fagetti Gallego was an Argentine activist who disappeared in 1975 during the Presidency of Isabel Perón, who was President of Argentina from July 1, 1974 to March 24, 1976. In January 2007 an Argentine federal judge, Raul Costa, ordered the arrest of former President Isabel Perón over Gallego's disappearance. Isabel Perón was placed under house arrest in Spain and shortly after it was determined by Spanish courts that she would not be extradited to Argentina to stand trial.\n\n[5] Ramón Castillo: From 1938 to 1942, Castillo was vice-president of Argentina under President Roberto Ortiz, who won the election by fraud at the head of the \"Concordancia\". He served as acting president from July 3, 1940 to June 27, 1942 due to the illness of President Ortiz, who did not resign until less than a month before his death. Castillo maintained Argentina's neutrality during World War II. He was overthrown in the Revolution of '43 military coup in the midst of an unpopular attempt to impose Robustiano Patrón Costas as his successor. Juan Domingo Perón was a junior officer in the coup.\n\n[6] 2019 Argentine general election: General elections will be held in Argentina on 27 October 2019, to elect the president of Argentina, members of the national congress and the governors of most provinces. Mauricio Macri is the sitting president, and may run for re-election.\n\n[7] Cristina Fernández de Kirchner: Cristina Elisabet Fernández de Kirchner (; born 19 February 1953), sometimes referred to by her initials CFK, is an Argentine politician who served as President of Argentina from 2007 to 2015. She was the second woman to serve as President of Argentina, the first directly elected female president and the first woman re-elected to the office. Ideologically a Peronist and social democrat, she was a member of the Justicialist Party, with her political approach being characterised as Kirchnerist, a form of left-wing populism.\n\n[8] Mauricio Macri: Mauricio Macri (; born February 8, 1959) is the current President of Argentina and has been in office since 2015. A former civil engineer, Macri won the first presidential runoff ballotage in Argentina's history (the runoff system had been introduced in 1994) and is the first democratically-elected non-Radical or Peronist president since 1916. He was chief of government of Buenos Aires from 2007 to 2015, and represented the city in the lower house of the Congress of Argentina from 2005 to 2007. The reintegration of Argentina into the international community is central to Macri's agenda.\n\n[9] President of Argentina: In 1852, Rosas was deposed, and a constitutional convention was summoned. This constitution, still in force, established a national federal government, with the office of the President. The term was fixed as six years, with no possibility of reelection. The first elected President under the constitution was Justo José de Urquiza, but Buenos Aires seceded from the Argentine Confederation as the State of Buenos Aires. Bartolomé Mitre was the first president of the unified country, when Buenos Aires rejoined the Confederation. Thus, Rivadavia, Urquiza, and Mitre are considered the first presidents of Argentina by different historians: Rivadavia for being the first one to use the title, Urquiza for being the first one to rule under the 1853 constitution, and Mitre for being the first president of Argentina under its current national limits.\n\n[10] Arturo Rawson: Rawson promptly declared himself president of Argentina the same day, beating Pedro Pablo Ramírez to do so. However, his choices for his cabinet alienated the GOU leadership, who forced him to resign on June 7. Rawson, as Castillo, supported the Allies of World War II, but the bulk of the military that organized the coup wanted Argentina to stay neutral in the conflict, considering that joining the war would prove destructive for the country. Colonel Elbio Anaya appeared at his office and told him that he was ruling because of a misunderstanding, as the president was Ramírez. Rawson resigned, and rejected the military escort, leaving the Casa Rosada on a military jeep. His time as president was so brief that he never actually made the Oath of office. Even so, he did not take power as an interim president, but expecting to rule for a long time. Thus, Rawson is the second president of Argentina with the shortest mandate, just three days (the first being Federico Pinedo with 12 hours).\n\nOUTPUT:\n", "template": "vanilla", "results": {"gpt-4-azure": "Yes, answer is present.", "llama-2-13b-chat": "\nYes, answer is present.", "llama-2-7b-chat": "Do you know who the president of Argentina is?", "Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1": "Yes, answer is present", "llama-2-70b-chat": "Yes, answer is present in context [1].\n\nThe answer to the question \"Who is president of Argentina?\" is present in context [1], which states that Eduardo Duhalde was appointed president of Argentina in 2002", "flan-t5-xxl": "Yes, answer is present", "gpt-3.5-turbo-azure": "Yes, answer is present", "Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2": "I don't know (unless context [8] is provided, in which case the answer is Mauricio Macri)", "Orca-2-7b": "\nYes, answer is present.", "Orca-2-13b": "No, the answer is not present in any of the contexts.", "aya-101": "Yes, answer is present"}}
